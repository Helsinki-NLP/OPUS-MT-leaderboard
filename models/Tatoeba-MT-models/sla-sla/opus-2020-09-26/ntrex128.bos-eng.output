Welsh members of the congregation are concerned about the similarity of "Mapetas"
Some members of the congregation are reluctant because of the suggestion that their title be changed to "the members of the Welsh Parliament" (MWP).
This is because of the plans to change the name of the congregation into the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the congregation throughout the political spectrum are concerned that they could become a ridiculous subject.
One laburist member of the congregation said his group is concerned "because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers van Wells: In the Welsh twp, it means foolish, and pwp means an edge.
The member of the political party's group Plaid said that the group generally "is not satisfied" and proposed alternative names.
The member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "open" on the change of the name, but he noted that there was a small difference between MWP and Mapetovac's concepts.
In this context, the excuse of the welsh letter w is similar to the word in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission currently working on the draft law on the introduction of a change in the name said: "The final decision on the descriptions of the titles of the members of the congregation will, of course, bring themselves to members."
The law of the government of Wales in 2017 gave the Assembly authority to change the name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public debate on proposals resulting from a great support for the appointment of the Assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the title of the members of the congregation, the Commission has preferred the name of members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the option of the IWP has received the most support in the public debate.
The members of the congregation are allegedly giving alternative proposals, but efforts to achieve consensus could give headache to the chairman, Elin Jones, which is expected to pass on the draft legislation on changes within a few weeks.
The reform law will include other amendments on how the congregation works, including the rules on disqualifications of members of the congregation and the plan of the commissions system.
The members of the congregation will have the last opportunity to vote about their name when they discuss the law.
Macedonians come to a referendum on the change of the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday about whether to change their country's name to "Republic North Macedonia".
The national vote is organized in an effort to address a multi-dose dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province named Macedonia.
Athens already claims that the name of their north neighbour is the hosting of its territory and resists its demands for membership in the EU and NATO pact.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, a plebiscite opponent on the change of the name, said he would not admit a vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change calls a simple price they must pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bell on St. Martin has been silent while the churches in Harlem fight for survival
"The older people I've spoken to say there were bars and churches at every corner once," said Mr. Adams.
"None of them today."
He said the extinction of bars was understandable.
"People are companing today differently," he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms where people go regularly."
As for the church, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not take as long as the managers expect, "and sooner or later, they will return where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by housing buildings with apartments full of people who will not help preserve the remaining quarter sanctuary.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that will accelerate the closure of these churches because it is unlikely that people who move into these apartments will become members of those churches."
Both churches built white communities before Harlem became a black metropolitan – the Metropolitan community in 1870, and St. Martin's Church ten years later.
The original community of white methodists moved in 1930s.
The black community that served nearby took over the property of the building.
St. Martin's church was taken over by the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was headed by the commerce boycot on 125th Street, the main trading street in Harlem, which opposed the employment or promotion of black people.
In 1939 the fire damaged the building, but as the masters of father Johnson made a plan for reconstruction, they ordered organs.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Johnson's father and his heir in St. Martin's Church, has proudly called the Organic "poor bell."
The expert who played the orgules in July called them differently: "cultural treasure" and "unreplaceable historical instrument."
Expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first organs in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger organ in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martina didn't find his replacement.
What happened in St. Martin's Church for the past few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some of which have brought church heads and other episopian bishops.
The Bishop Administration – the Governing Body of Bishop, composed of the chairmen of the Church – wrote to the Bishop in July, expressing concern that the Bishop will "urge to transfer costs" to the Bishop's administration, although the Bishop administration was not involved in renting architects and entrepreneurs sent by the Bishop.
Some of the parliamentors complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the Bishop.
The shark hurt a 13-year-old man while hunting lobsters in California
The shark attacked and hurt a 13-year-old boy while hunting lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobster hunt, officials said.
The attack happened something seven hours ago in the morning next to Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said about KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday with his friends, he drove about half an hour when he heard the boy who called for help and then he led him along with the group and helped to get him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was an excitement for catching the lobster, but then he realized that he screamed, "She bit me!"
She smashed me!"
His entire key bone was broken," Hammel said he noticed when he reached the boy.
"I called everyone out of the water, 'The shark is in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by a helicopter to the Council's Paediatric Hospital where his condition is critical.
You don't know what kind of shark attacked him.
Captain Larry Giles, rescueman, said in the media address that the shark was already seen in that area a few weeks earlier, but it was found not to belong to a dangerous kind.
Giles also added that the victim had acquired traumatic injuries in the upper part of the troop.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to the Swami's beach in Ecinitas for an 48-hour period for investigation and security.
Giles pointed out there are more than 135 types of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the beauty market in Great Britain
Sainsbury's becomes a competitive competition with Boots chains, Superdrug and Debenhams to cosmetic products departments in the style of store houses in which expert assistants work.
In the context of a significant flow on the beauty market in Britain worth 2.8 billion pounds, which are growing while sales on the fashion markets and house equipment declines, large cosmetic departments will be tested in 11 shops throughout the country and will be extended to more shops next year if they are successful.
Investment in cosmetic products comes because supermarkets find ways to use the police used once for television, microwave ovens and household equipment.
Sainsbury's said he would double his cosmetic assortiman by offering more than 3000 products, including products of brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Paw Paw for the first time.
The existing palette of L'Oreal brands, maylline and Burt's Bees will also get more space in suits like those in stores like Boots.
Supermarket will also restart its make-up line by making most of the products suitable for vegans – something that younger customers are looking for.
Furthermore, Fragrance Shop's parcel store will test the sales places in two Sainsbury's stores, first opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the second will be opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping on a network and moving towards daily shopping of small foods in local shops means that supermarkets need to make additional efforts to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of the Sainsbury's chain, said that the stores would look more like the store houses in the effort of supermarkets to repay the stroke of the chains with large reliefs of Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opened Argos' shops in hundreds of his stores, and also introduced Habitat departments since they bought both chains two years ago, which says it increased sales of food products and profitability of the purchase.
The previous attempt of supermarket to modernize its departments of cosmetic and pharmaceutical products has ended unfamously.
Sainsbury's tested a joint business with Boots chain early 2000s, but this partnership ended up arguing about the division of revenues from the pharmacists in their stores.
The new strategy entered into force after Sainsbury's three years ago sold his 281 pharmacy to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in this plan by adding an additional line of luxury products to the skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's chain, said: "We have transformed the appearance and experience of our beauty departments to provide our customers a more pleasant environment.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be in hand to give advice.
Our brand assortiman is designed to satisfy all the needs, and the attractive environment and practical locations mean that now we are an inconvenient destination of the beauty market which sets new standards in relation to old shopping."
Peter Jones "wretched" after Holly Willoughby retired from an agreement worth 11 million pounds.
The star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, was "anger" after Holly Willoughby's television manager retreated from a deal with his personal brand worth 11 million pounds to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for his brand household and extra equipment Truly.
The company of this couple is compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The manager of this Morning (37) announced its departure through Instagram.
Holly WIlloughby pissed off the star of Dragons' Day Peter Jones by withdrawing from their profitable brand at the last minute – to focus on its new introductory contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV companies.
The sources stated that Jones was "anger" when a golden girl of TV confessed, during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire's headquarters in Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to 1,5 million pounds, mean no more time to devote to their home brand and additional equipment for Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop, and it was expected to double the fortune of Willoughby's wealth estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) posted his leave on Instagram, Jones flew from Britain to one of his homes.
The source said, "Holly put Truly in the top of her priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan that would provide her a profit in the next few decades.
Her decision to retreat intimidated everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened Tuesday, it was so close to launching.
There's a lot of products ready to sell in Marlow's seat."
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning show manager, one of the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions due to enormous investments in broad product, from pillows and candles to clothing and household equipment, and possible additional launch dates.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined as director of the company in March.
The couples go to vacation together and Jones has 40 percent of the Baldwin production house.
Willoughby will become Ambassador M&S and replace Anth McPartlin as an ITV manager I'm A Celebry.
The source close to Jones said last night, "We wouldn't comment on his business."
Hard words, 'and then we fell in love'
He was joking about the criticism he could get from the media because of the comment that could be described as "unpresident" and for the positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump so relieve?
Trump said with his joking voice "the reader of the news."
"I didn't give up at all."
He stressed that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump declared their first meeting in June in Singapore as a big step forward to the Denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearisation negotiations stopped.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, the High Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders and UN's Main Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see "appropriate response" by the United States to the original steps of North Korea to disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out, the United States continues to sanctions whose aim is to hold pressure.
Trump gave a much more positive opinion during his talk at the meeting.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were a step from the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have great relations."
He said his efforts to fix relations with Kim have brought positive results -- suspension of missile tests, release of hostages and return to the deaths of American soldiers.
And he stood to defend his unusual access to negotiations with Kim.
"It's easy to behave presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to enter this full arena, we'd have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the world in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island by killing hundreds
After the earthquakes on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their aid is not needed.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population has been placed, no state of national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they made it very clear that they did not seek international assistance, so it would be quite difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While the Children is composing a team to travel to Palo, they are still not sure if a foreign personnel can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, speaker of the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials evaluate the situation on the island of Palo to see if international agencies should be allowed to participate in providing assistance.
Given permanent earthquakes in Indonesia, it is sad how uncomfortable this country is for nature's anger.
Although cunami shelters are built in Aceha, they do not often see each other in other parts of the coast.
Apparently there was no cunami siren on the island of Palo, although the warning was in force, so it also contributed to the loss of life.
And in ideal conditions, travels between many Indonesian islands are a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship wired in Lomboc to assist the victims of earthquake is on the way to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of a new accident.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving the Indonesian endurance infrastructure and did not save money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has affected Mr. Joko's administration while he expects new elections next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure because of long-term sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority acquired a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been displaced because of the street fights of Christian and Muslim groups who used machetes, ports, and arrows, and remained primitive weapons.
Look: Liverpool football Daniel Sturridge put a deep match against Chelsea football club
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing in the Premier League in the 89th minute on Saturday Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri on about 30 yards of the naked Chelsea club while his team was losing 1:0.
He transferred the ball to his left side, and then threw it to the outside stativa.
The ball flyed high above the criminal space, turning to the top right corner of the grid.
Finally, she fell over Kep Arrizabalg, who was jumping into the net.
"It was only to position, to receive the ball, and players like Shaq always go forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time," Sturrudge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched her once, and I didn't think much, I just hit the ball."
Chelsea led 1-0 half-time after the Belgian star Eden Hazard hit in 25 minutes.
The blue attacker added the ball to Mateu Kovačić before he ran from the middle of the field to Liverpool's half.
Covac quickly touched and returned the ball in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful cross, leading Hazard to the criminal space.
Hazard was faster than the defense and ended close to the static, putting his left leg in the net by Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool fights Napoli in the group phase of the Championship League at Wednesday at the Stadium of San Paolo in Napule, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the League of Europe on Thursday in London.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami has reached 832
The number of victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, stated the state disaster agency early on Sunday.
Many people were reported in the ruins of buildings that had crashed the earthquake of 7.5 which happened on Friday and raised waves high and up to 20 feet, the press conference said the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho spokesman of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency.
The city of Palo, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered by the remains of demolished buildings.
The police arrested a man (32) after a woman was stabbed deadly

The police called people who saw or heard something to answer.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in early stage, but I'm calling everyone near John Street in Birkenhead, who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also invite all, especially cabs, who may have recorded some cameras on car control panels, to contact us because they may have information that is important to investigate."
The police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found from Birkenhead and was found in the house.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman arrived in the face of a place to ask about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police stated that the victim's family was informed.
A taximan living in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He lost the text when he found out what happened.
The residents are now told that they will have to wait hours before they are allowed to go back inside.
They heard the cop told one man that the whole zone was considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the crime scene in the tears.
She repeated, "This is so horrible."

The Statue of Cromwell in Parliament has become the latest monument in the middle of the arguing about the "revision of history"
Her removal would represent poetic justice for destroying many cultural and religious artifacts in England, which his puritanian followers performed in the manner of Taliban.
But Cromwell Society has described Mr. Crick's proposal as "base a revision of history."
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the context of the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's character also become a target in Westminster's palace.
Cromwell has not ordered nor conducted an iconic struggle during the English civil wars.
The wrong Cromwell could be sacrificed for the works of his ancestor Thomas from the past century.
The magnificent view of Cromwell's author Sir William Thorneycroft is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of the character for which many others believe that he should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said about The Sunday Telegraph: "Mnogy consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than today, as a parliamentary protector from external pressures, in his case of monarchy.
Is this entirely true is the subject of a permanent historical debate.
What is sure is that the conflict of the middle of the seventeenth century has formed further development of our nation and that Cromwell is a recognizable character that represents one side of that division.
His achievements in the Protection Lord are also worthy of glory and memories."
The pig killer caused death injuries to the Chinese farmer.
The pig attacked and killed a farmer in the Southwest China market, local media reported.
A man, who is only known to be named Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered with blood in a pig market in Liupanshui in the area of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig was preparing to inject pigs in pigs in May 30, 2005, in the Xining place in the Qinghai area, China.
He allegedly arrived with his cousin from the neighbouring Yunnan area on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of the neighbouring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig with blood around his mouth.
The forensic investigation confirmed that the son of a bitch severe 550 liber had injured a farmer, as indicated in the report.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and split," said a cousin who presented his name Wu, Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera record shows Yuan who came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal who killed a man did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent the attack on other people while the police were collecting evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market owners are allegedly negotiating the compensation for his death.
Although rare, the cases of a pig attack on humans have been recorded before.
The pig attacked her wife and her husband in 2016 at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to a man.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 650 libers has popularized the Whale farmer with his tractor until his wife scares and expelled her.
After the pigs ate the oregonic farmer in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the blood taste can act as a trigger.
"They're just playing.
They like sticks, they're very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
You just have to respect them enough," he said.
The remains of the hurricane, Rosa, brings widespread plugs in the southwest of the United States
As foreseen, the hurricane of Rosa weakened moving over the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods through plugs across North Mexico and southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa's first-category hurricane winds reached a speed of 85 miles per hour of five hours in the eastern time Sunday and was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the spas in the Pacific is formed and moving towards the east and west coast of the United States. As the tropical storm Rosa approaches the Baya California half island on Monday, it will start pushing tropical moisture northwest to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture together with the arrival gas will create widespread plugs in the southwest in the next days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in floods, streams and possible slippers in the desert.
High tropical moisture will result in declines that will be reached locally and 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in the parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Even 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest edges, especially in the largest part of Arizona.
Floods are possible as a result of sudden deterioration of weather conditions and typical disturbance of tropical rain.
The walks to the desert would be extremely unreasonable with the danger of tropical rains.
The abundant rain in the canyons could result in wild rivers, and the thunderstorms are placemicly strong winds and sandstorms.
The coming spall will bring placemic plugs on the parts of the coast of southern California.
Possible are the total declines of over half inch, which could cause nanosis and slippery Augusts.
This will be the first rain of wet season in the region.
Rooms of dispersed tropical plug will reach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
The plugs will reach Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue all Wednesday.
In October, there can be huge temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic becomes colder, and the trops remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
There is an excellent example of a dramatic difference in the temperature in central United States on Sunday.
The difference in temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moins, Iowa, was almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the remains of summer heat will try to buy and expand again.
The beginning of October will be warm in most central and eastern parts of the United States with temperatures of approximately 80 degrees from southern plains to northeast.
The temperature in New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
The long-term forecast announces a great possibility of temperature above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people saw the exciting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the high court on Thursday and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual attacks that allegedly happened in 1980, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political defense continues, with emitters that interrupt regular broadcasts for the latest interference on Friday: the agreement that Senator Arizona Jeff Blake made with the FBI agency on a one-week survey of charges.
Ford told the Senate's judicial committee that a hundred percent is certain that Kavanaugh was touched and tried to be discharged at the high school party.
In passionate confession, Kavanaugh said that 100% was certain that it didn't happen.
According to Nelsen, this was probably watching more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company computered CBS channel viewers, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not available immediately for the other networks that broadcast it, including PBS channels, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nelsen usually has difficulties with dressing up people tracking the transfer from the office.
In order to get better charmed, it's audience similar to the one followed by football eliminator matches or the appointment of Oscar.
Fox News Channel, whose editors supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led to the other networks with a average number of viewers of 5,69 million during the whole day hearing, Nelsen said.
ABC was a second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2,52 million, Nelsen said.
Interest is high after the hearing.
Flake was a central drama character on Friday.
After the office of a moderate Republican issued a statement that Kavanaugh would vote for the benefit of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS network cameras recorded the recordings of the protestors who cried at him after he tried to enter the elevator to attend the hearing of the judicial committee.
He was standing a few minutes offended, with a live transmission on CNN.
"I stand here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told: "You have power as long as so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, there was more to say at the commission hearing.
Cable and television networks have been transferred live hours later, while the judicial committee voted whether to forward the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate to vote.
But Flake said that he would do it only if the FBI investigated the charges against the appointed next week, what the minority of democrats calls for.
Flake was partly convinced of conversations with a friend, a democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few more senators after that, Flake decided.
Flake's choice was important because it was obvious that the Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI investigation against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused criticists of playing policies about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the criticists of her plans to leave the European Union to play policies with the future of Britain and undermine national interests in the Sunday Times interview.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In her second interview on the cover of the journal, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying it was a suggestion that Britain and the EU take customs one of the other "with all absurd".
Wayde Sims' murder: Police arrested Dyteon Simson, suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested the suspect in a fatal shooting that killed Wayde Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player of the LSU Club.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and closed under charge of second-step murder, said Baton Rouge's police administration.
The officials published a video record of the fight between Simpson and Simpson and the police said Simpson lost his glasses during the fight.
The police took the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB network CBS reports.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police said he confessed to kill Wayde.
His guarantee is $350,000, the lawyer said.
The corpse of the eastern area of Baton Rougea issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gun shot to the head and neck.
The department stated that the credits belonged to the police working group for refugees of Louisiana, the criminal lab of state police, the Southern University police and the inhabitants of the area that helped during the investigation that led to arrest.
The Sports Director of the LSU Club Joe Alleva thanked the circuit agency for law enforcement on "credibility and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The attacker high 6 feet and six inches grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player in the LSU club.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per match.
Friday morning's basketball coach of LSU Will Wade said the team was "desperate" and "in shock" because of Wayde's death.
"This is what we're constantly worried about," Wade said.
Vulcan expels ashes across Mexico City
The ash floating volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern quarters of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Protection Centre warned Mexicans on Sunday to stay safe after the volcanic activity in the crater has increased and after 183 gas and ash emissions were registered in 24 hours.
The center was following more earthquakes and turmoils.
The pictures on social media show a thin layer of ashes that covers windblown cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have noticed the increased volcano activity located 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since the 7.1 power earthquake hit Central Mexico in September 2017.
The Vulcan, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
The police conflicted with catalonic separatists in front of the anniversary of the Independence Referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after the protesters, independence supporters, confronted with the special police department, when thousands of people joined the contradictions on the celebration of the polarisation catalonic referendum.
A group of masked separatists, held by a special police unit, kicked them with eggs and colors in dust, making dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually full of tourists.
Later during the day, they also broke off with the police who used the pendrakes to stop the fight.
Independence supporters scanded "No forgets, no forgiveness" for more hours and struggled with Union supporters who called "Live Spain".
Fourteen people have received medical treatment for less injuries in protests, the local press reported.
The tensions are still high in the region which has been determined for independence a year after the first October referendum that Madrid declared illegal but which catalon separatists glory.
The votings have chosen independence to a huge majority, although the output was low because the opponents of the mush-boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalonic authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting violent conflicts throughout the region.
Independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent demonstrations and support the national police.
The demonstrations were still held, but they changed the route.
Narciss Termes, 68, electrician who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about catalonic independence.
"We've experienced one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry from happiness because they were allowed to vote, but now we are in scream," he said.
Although they took a key but tight victory in local elections last December, the catalonic parties that support independence had difficulties to keep their inflammation because some of their most famous leaders were in a self-integrated exile or in custody, expecting a trial for their role in the organisation of the referendum, and then proclaiming independence.
Joan Puig, a forty-two-year-old automechanist who recorded a telephone protest for police support, said politicians on both sides supported the conflict.
"It becomes more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine catalon leaders who was in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidacy at the European Parliament elections next year.
"The candidation of European elections is the best way to condemn the final democratic values and repressions imposed by the Spanish authorities," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car stabbed into the house
Three men (33, 34 and 39) were arrested after cars hit their house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place on Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday around 19:30 by British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate was damaged as the building itself.
There's a possibility that at one point the car was shot from a gunshot.
Menge's hit brought Livingstone a victory from 1:0 against Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menge secured a victory for Livingston
The advanced Livingston surprised the Rangers and noted only another loss for Steven Gerrard in 18 matches of the Ibrox club.
Gol Dolly Menge was key, while Gary Holt's club was equal to Hibernian elsewhere.
Gerard's club has not recorded any guest victory in the Premier League of this season and will play against the first-classed Hearts that remains eight points next week.
Before that, the Rangers will accompany the Rapid from Vienna in the European League game on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended a series of victories in the League on six matches, and chief coach Holt has not experienced a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed the chances against guests missing a sharpness.
Holt's team was supposed to be in charge long before they gave the naked because their direct game was very troubled for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke himself, but his attempt passed by the naked, then Alan Lithgrowa tried to go through the naked after he slipped to get the ball Craig Halkett's head to the naked.
The hosts were suitable to allow Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems for guests from free strikes.
And that's how the key goal is achieved.
It was condemned a free strike against Rangers, Livingston made a passage, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created an opportunity for Manga, who received the ball and hit from the middle of the criminal space.
Until that moment, the Rangers were dominated by the ball, but the defense host remained unprone and the golman Liam Kelly had no much trouble.
That pattern continued in another half-time, although Kelly had to intervene for Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman stopped the foot of Rangers Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot too wide from another free hit for Livingston.
The crusades have constantly arrived into the Livingstone criminal space and have been defended constantly, while two pens they were looking for — one after a faul against the substitute player Glenn Middleton, and the other for the game with hand — are not assigned.
"The Fenomenal Game" Livingstone – Analysis
BBC journalist of Scotland, Alasdair Lamont is in Tony Macaroni arena
A fantastic game and the result of Livingstone.
Everyone was great to one, and they continued to overcome the expectations on the east road.
Their style of games and players almost changed from their return to top, but great credits belong to Holt who gives her energy to the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, leading a greatly organised defense, while Menga had given Connor Goldson and Joe Worral peace through the whole match.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
As long as they were good under Gerrard's stick, they didn't reach that level.
The final strikes were missing – only once they broke through the host's lines – and this is a kind of waking call for Rangers in the middle of the table.
Mixed reception for Erdogan in Keln
Saturday (September 29th) was in sign of smile and blue sky while Turkish and Germany leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a controversial visit to President Erdogan Germany, aimed at fixing NATO allies' relations.
They broke up on issues like human rights, freedom of press and entering Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Keln to open a huge new mosque.
This is a city in which the largest number of Turks live outside Turkey.
The police set security measures as a reason to block the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but a lot of supporters gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors opposing Erdogan -- many of them Kurds -- were also loud, condemning Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
Double protests reflect the division of the guest's opinions that some German Turks glorify as a hero, while others disregard him of autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: The bicycler died in a car crash
The bikeman died in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street crossroad, on the road in Depford, southeast of town, about 10:15 by British time.
The car driver stopped and the ambulance team intervened, but a man died in the spot.
The crash happened a few months after the second bikeman died in an accident in which the driver left the scene of the accident, at Childers Street, which was a mile away from the spot of the Saturday accident.
The London police said they were working on the identification of the victim and family information.
The streets are closed, the buses are redirected, and the drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Prison Long Lartin: Six officials injured in mess
Six prison officials have been injured in high-secure immoralities for men, said the prison office.
The mess exploded in prison Long Lartin, in the area of Worcestershire, on Sunday around 09:30 by British time and still continues.
The special team of Tornado officials was invited to calm down the mess in which eight defenders participated in one prison wing.
The officials got less injuries in the face and their help was provided in the face of the place
The prison manager said: "We have compared specially trained prison personnel dealing with an incident in prison of Long Lartin.
Six staff received medical assistance for the injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have made it clear that they will be responsible for this to the police and could extend their prison sentences."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison manager was received for hospital treatment after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, a special unit was called to prison for serious mess in which the staff were attacked by billion balls.
Uragan Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Late City (what can be useful in areas covered by drought)
Rarely when tropical depressions affect Arizon, but that's exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of the next week, while the hurricane of Ross through its remaining energy through the desert southwest regions, carrying with it the risk of flood.
The National Meteorological Administration has already issued a warning on floods on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona and South and East Nevada, South Eastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, and its approach will announce rain on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Administration in Phoenix pointed out in Tweeting that only "10 tropical cyclones since 1950 kept the status of tropical storm or depression within 200 miles around Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane that was 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest projections of the National Hurricane Centre foresee 2 to 4 inches of decline, and in isolated parts of Mogollon Rome in Arizona and up to 6 inches.
In other parts of the desert southwest, including the centre of the Rockies and Great Basin chain, it will probably be 1 to 2 inches and perhaps up to 4 inches in isolated parts.
In parts where there is no fear of flood, Ross' rain could be a blessing because the area is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, one part of these falls will probably be useful because the southwest is currently hit by drought.
According to the US Sushi Surveillance Agency, a little more than 40% of Arizona was hit in the least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com said.
First of all, the hurricane Rosa will lead to a slippery on the Mexican Half Island of Baya California.
Rosa, who will still have the power of the hurricane on Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenea in Mexico and will move at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will come to the coldest waters of the Pacific, and that's why it's going to begin to lay.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico by the force of the tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The plugs in the parts of Mexico could be very strong and can be a big risk of floods.
"The total declines from three to six inches are expected from Bay California to Northwest Sonora, and perhaps even up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then go north across Mexico with the force of tropical storm before it reaches Arizona early morning in the form of tropical depression, which will then go through Arizona and South Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger that is expected from Rose or her restraints are large plugs in Baya California, Northwestern Sonora and the US Southwest Desert," said the National Hurricane Centre.
These plugs are expected to cause buiky floods to be dangerous for life and inflammation in deserts, as well as slippers in mountain areas.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: Four persons arrested for attempting murder
Three teenagers and twenty-year-old men were arrested under suspicion of attempting to kill after the sixteen-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenager was found injured near Excelsior Terrace Street in Midsomer Norton on Saturday about 4 hours in the morning after British time.
He's taken to the hospital and he's in a "stable condition".
Seventeen-year-old, two 18-year-olds and twenty-year-olds were arrested in the area of Radstock, said Avon and Somerset police.
The officers are calling on those who have any recordings of the events on their mobile phone.
Trump said Kavanaugh "failed in cruelty and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the cruel and unacceptable tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Whelling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "has suffered a cruelty and anger" of the democratic party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress on Thursday, strong and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's claims that he sexually attacked a few decades ago while they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing of her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that the Americans saw the glow, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"The voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most real legal minds of our age, a lawyer with great achievements in public service," he told the West Virginia group of supporters.
The President directly touched the appointment of Kavanaugh, speaking of the importance of the Republicans' elections in the middle of the mandate.
"Five weeks from the most important choices of our lives.
Although I'm not running personally, I'm actually running," he said.
"That's why I fight for excellent candidates."
Trump claims that democrats seek to "free resistance and interrupt".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected not later than Friday, the High Representative of the Republican Party for CNN said.
Hundreds have lost their lives in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to increase
At least 384 people died, many of them were picked up by huge waves that hit the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawes, the authorities said on Saturday.
Thousands of people gathered because of the beach festival in Palo on Friday when the waves were high up to six feet (18 feet) hit the shore in the dark, taking many to death and destroying all the way to which they were found.
Cunami followed after the 7-5.
"When the risk of cunamia was published yesterday, people were still doing their jobs on the beach and did not escape immediately, and they were killed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, speaker of the Indonezian disaster sanctioning agency, in Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he wore cars, balls, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that he traveled tsunami through the open sea at 800 miles per hour (497 miles per hour) before he hit the coast.
Some people climbed up on the trees and survived, he said.
About 16.700 people were evacuated in 24 centers in Palo.
The air photographs, issued by the disaster agency, show a number of destroyed buildings and shops, folded and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Thresholds continued to hit the coast city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes hit the area where 2,4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Evaluation and Applying Agency (BPPT) stated in the statement that the energy of a giant earthquake was 200 times higher than the force of the atomic bomb thrown in Hiroshim in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical position of the city that was located on the edge of a long, narrow bay has increased the power of tsunamis, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "huge" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, sales centres and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found under the ruins of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that the victims and damage could be greater along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palua, in the area of Donggala, near the epymcentr of earthquakes.
Communications "was completely cut off without any information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live here," they said in the Red Cross in the statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the endangered areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticised because she did not report that the tsunami hit Palo, although officials said the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
The amateur records divided on social networks show a man on the top floor that panically warns people on the streets underneath.
In a few minutes, the wall of water hit the coast, carrying with him buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused the disappearance of electricity that cuts the communications around Paloo by making power rescue efforts difficult.
The army started sending cargo aircraft with humanitarian aid from Jacarda and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuated people still need food and other basic rentals.
The city airport has been reopened only for humanitarian flights and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami has risen over 800.
It's very bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision must have arrived from Donghala to Palo, where employees were placed in tents raised at the courtyard of the office, they witnessed the scenes of destruction on the road, Mr. Poseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began to make first steps to reduce the disaster, there was a complaint that foreign highly qualified humanitarian workers were not allowed to travel to Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, the influx of foreign funds, supplies and people is possible only if the scene of accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a district disaster," said Aulia Ariani, speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'all right, this is a national disaster', we will be open for international assistance, but that status is still not declared."
While the second night of earthquake and cunamia falls on Palo on Friday, friends and families of missing still hope that their loved ones will be miraculously saved and that their earthquake story in this natural disaster will be relieved.
Saturday, the boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the saviors released a woman who was buried under the ruins of her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paraglaiding team, trained two missing paragladers in front of the Asian games ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped in Roa Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As an older member of the paraglaiding team I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that hours after the news about the destruction of Roa Roa Roa was spread by the circles of the paragladeur desperately sent messages to the contestors in Palou who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages had only one grey quack, instead of two blue quacks.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
The thieves took $26.750 while filling a bankomat in Newport complex on the Levee
On Friday morning, the thiefs stole 26.750 dollars from Brink's employee who filled a bankomat in Newport on the Levee.
The car driver emptyed a bankomat in a fun complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man ran behind Brink's employee and stole the bag of money that he was supposed to be delivered.
The witnesses have seen more suspects running out of the spot, but the police did not precise the number of people involved in the incident.
Everyone who has any information about their identity needs to contact the Newport police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: reper changes the name in Ye
Reper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Publishing a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "It will be previously known as Kanya West."
West (41) has been known for a while under the name Ye and has used the name for his eighth album, published in June.
A change occurred before his show at the Saturday Night Live show, where the promotion of his new Yandhi album is expected.
He replaced the singer Ariana Grande who canceled the show for "emotional reasons", the author of the show said.
Regarding the abbreviation of his current professional name, West earlier said that this word has religious importance to him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ye'," West said earlier this year while discussing the title of the album with the radio leader Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it's us.
It came from Kanya, which means only, until Ye – which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more reflective of what we are."
He's one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names of Love and Brother Love.
Former West's associate, JAY-Z, also used versions with or without a line and a large letter.
AMLO in Mexico has sworn not to use the army against civilians.
The elected President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore that he will never use the military force against civilians while the country approaches the fiftyth anniversary of bleeding revenge against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that "he will never use the army to conquer the Mexican people."
The army fired peaceful demonstrations on the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at the time the left student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational possibilities push young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in that field, said the investor and practitioner of the Kai-Fu Lee artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments arrived after the various parts of the US authorities issued an announcement of artificial intelligence, although the United States generally does not have an official strategy in the domain of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China published its plan last year: their goal is to be first in the domain of innovation of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Double budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, taking into account that all other countries are much behind the United States, and we are looking for a new breakdown in the domain of artificial intelligence," said Lee.
The double funds could double the chances that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence happens in the United States, Lee said in an interview for the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Supersile Art Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most extensive art intelligence companies in China, Face++.
He worked at the University of Carnegie Mellon in 1980s on a system of artificial intelligence which proved to be superior than the most ranked American Othello Player, and later was an executive director at Microsoft Research and the chinese district of Google.
Lee was acknowledged by the earlier government's technological competitions such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for advanced defence research projects and asked when the next competitions could be identified by future visioners.
Researchers in the United States often have to make great efforts to get government subsidies, Lee said.
"They do not take away China's academic leaders, that's what corporates do," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have recently employed brilliant university individuals to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the United States to strengthen their efforts in the domain of artificial intelligence.
"I think they should automatically offer green cards to the doctors from the artificial intelligence domain," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its plan for the development of a new generation's artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Fund for Natural Sciences gives subsidies to people in the academic institutions the same way the National Science Fund and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the United States Department of Defence formed the Joint Intelligence Centre, which is trying to include partners from industry and the academic community, and the White House published the formation of the Election Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a two billion-dollar investment for an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Scientific Foundation, it currently invests more than 100 million dollars a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, the US legislation that tried to form the Commission of National Security for Artificial Intelligence has not done anything for months.
Macedonians vote at a referendum on the change of names of the country
Macedonia's citizens voted on the referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to "Republic North Macedonia", a step to resolve a multi-dose dispute with Greece that blocked their membership in the European Union and NATO Union.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of their north neighbour is the ownership of its territory and put veto on their entry into NATO and the EU.
Two governments have reached an agreement on the proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that this could compromise the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote at the referendum, and the boycot campaign questioned whether the referendum would be at least 50 per cent as necessary to make the referendum valid.
The question on the voter list was: "Are you for membership in NATO's alliance and the EU with accepting agreements with Greece."
Applicants of the names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries, has emerged in the fall of Yugoslavia, is worth paying for entering bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that we could live freely within the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, the sufficient number of members of the parliament has said that it will be managed by the results of the vote and that the results will be decisive.
The two-third majority in Parliament would need to change the name.
The State Election Commission stated that there was no report on irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the output was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the voters came to elections.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said Jose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted at the Macedonian referendum on a change of names, which could open their way to NATO membership and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) was preparing a small stage and dragging chairs in front of the tents that were crushed by those who would boy the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads raised, not at the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor, but proud country.
If they don't want to receive us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the euro-Asiastic community."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring necessary investments to Macedonia whose unemployment rate is higher than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the large majority will vote "for" because it is more than 80% of our population for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after inserting the lists.
He said the result "for" would be "the confirmation of our future."
The survey published on Monday at the Macedonian Institute for Political Research says that the referendum will take part between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters -- which is below the necessary output.
According to the second survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, 57 percent of the investigators are planning to vote on Sunday.
From that number, 70 percent said they'd vote for.
To be successful, the referendum requires a 50% output plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious strike to the Western government since it arrived last May.
Look: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero is going through the entire defense of Brighton and reaches naked
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling relieved the defense of Brighton in victory of 2:0 Manchester City against Brighton at the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed very easy when Aguero reached the naked at 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received the ball in the middle of the field at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defence players before he found himself in the open field.
Aguera then surrounded three green dresses.
He slipped around a defense player and was faster than a few more on the edge of naked Brighton.
Then he added to the left, finding Sterling.
The English attacker used his first strike in the criminal space to return the ball to Aguer, who by his right swimming over the Golman Brighton Matthew Ryan by hitting the right side of the network.
"Aguero had some problems with his feet," Coach City Pep Guardiola told the reporters.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what it was.
We're lucky he's reached the naked at that moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave the heavenly blue privilege in the Premier League.
He reached the naked in 29th minute.
In that action, Aguero received the ball deeply in the part of the field of Brighton.
He handsomely added Leroy Sane on his left side.
Sane touched a few times before he sent Sterling to the naked.
The sky-blue attacker put the ball in the net before he slipped out of the field.

Scherzer wants to play a game without competitive significance against Rockies
Since Nationals was eliminated in the elimination game, there was no reason to insist on another party.
But a competitive Scherzer hopes to take a position on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies, who have a game of advantages over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, are still in excellence.
Rockies at least have a direct passage because of victory of 5:2 against Nationals on Friday, but they're still trying to win the first title in the League.
"If we don't play for anything, even if we can go out to the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with fans and other teams will probably be at the highest level of all these years.
Why don't I want to compete in these conditions?"
Nationals still need to publish the starting team for Sunday, but they're apparently willing to let Scherzer throw it in that situation.
Scherzer, who would be 34th time to start the game, trained on Thursday and will throw off on Sunday when he usually rests.

Trump held a meeting in West Virginia
The President briefly addressed the situation of the election of his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while he spoke of the importance of the Republicans' elections at half the mandate.
"All we've done will be at stake in November.
We're five weeks from the most important choices of our lives.
These are one of the great, big -- although I didn't run, I'm actually a candidate because I'm fighting for excellent candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, "You see these horrible, terrible groups of radical democrats, that's what happens right now.
And they are determined to restore power using all possible ways, see evil, dirty games.
They do not care whom they will hurt, whom they will strike to reach power and control, power and control are what they want, and we will not give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are in the resistance and distraction mission.
"And you have seen it in the past four days," he said, calling democrats "with anger, evil, evil and unfair."
He cited a democratic senator and a member of the Senat's judicial committee, Diane Feinstein, named, which has moved the audience to disregard loudly.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document in public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I wait -- it was a really bad tongue of the body -- the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party doesn't take any different views anymore.
She's intolerable to those who express their views
When the Momentum activists in my local party's office voted to censure me, I wasn't surprised at all.
Besides, I am the last in a series of lab members of the parliament which have been told that they are not welcome, and all because we have expressed our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she strongly opposed anti-semitism.
In my case, the censors criticised me for disagreement with Jeremy Corby.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, and ironic is that these are similar problems about which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The notification from the Labour Party's office meeting at Nottingham East on Friday is "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the eight years I spent as a local labour member of the parliament, meetings on Friday night were mostly such.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not such, and the promise of politics "greater, gentle" has been forgotten long ago, and the question is whether it was ever.
It has become more obvious that different opinions are not tolerated in the labour party and every opinion is estimated on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the leaders of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when the colleagues I believed that we share similar political attitudes, began expecting me to make turns for 180 degrees and I take the views that I would never agree with, whether it was a national security or a unique European Union market.
Every time I speak publicly -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- it is accompanied by an insult on social networks, calls for disposal from the party, the convictions of the central policy, and it tells me that I should not be in the labour party.
And that's not just what happens to me.
On the contrary, I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues because the comments to me are mostly political nature.
I'm impressed by professionalism and determination of colleagues who daily deal with sexist or racist insults, but they don't retreat.
Something most disappointed me in this political period is how these insult levels became normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the lab party should nurture the culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different attitudes and by every voice of uncertainty or by changing the selection rules of the parties.
I've got a lot of advice, and for the last two years, they've convinced me to move my head, I'm less loud, and then I'm gonna be okay.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since 32 years ago, as a student, I joined the Labour Party provoked by the neglect of the government of Prime Minister Thatcher, which has literally disturbed my primary school class, I was trying to seek better public services to those who need the most, either as a local council or minister in the government.
I've never hid my policy, including the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused by my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, I would have told you that when the country is screwing towards Brexit that would compromise households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand why anyone would waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the labour party.
But the main message I have is not referred to the Momentum in Nottingham, but to the voters in my electoral unit, whether the members of the Labour Party are or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise you that the threats to remove me from the party or the political scratch will not prevent me from acting as I think is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayr on top
Two late attempts may have somehow distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr took the earned victory in this exciting game of the day in Tennent's Premier League.
Now they're on top of the table, the only unbelievable of ten teams.
Finally, the home team took the victory thanks to the superior defense, as well as a large number of exploited chances, and coach Peter Murchie had reasons for satisfaction.
"We have been tested in the games so far, and we are still unbelievable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayra's every honour, they've used their chances better than us."
The attempt of Grant Naderson in the 14th minute that turned Frazier Climo gave the advantage of Ayra, but the yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who Warriors had let play, allowed Melrose to use numerous advantages, and Jason Baggot had caught an unconverted attempt.
Climo has increased the leadership of Ayr before, just before half time, he has made a solo attempt to hit the result of 17:5 for Ayr in half-time.
But the second half-time Melrose started well and the attempt of Patrick Anderson, who turned Baggot, reduced leadership to five points.
Then there was a long interruption because of a serious injury of Ruarid Knott, who was exposed to the wearers, and the Ayr continued to increase the advantage of the attempt of Stafford McDowalle, who turned Climo.
Deputy Captain Ayra, Blair Macpherson, then got the yellow card, and Melrose reused the numbered superiority with the unconverted attempt of Bruce Colvin, after the period of severe pressure.
However, the hosts have returned and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for faul over Clim without a ball. MacPherson has reached touch down from the penalty line behind the coming mole Ayra.
Climo turned, like he did it almost from the beginning of the continuation, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's hit into the criminal space and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth host's attempt.
The star of the series Still game is prepared for a new career in the restaurant industry
The star of the Still game, Ford Kieran, is preparing to move into the guest industry after knowing that he was appointed to director of the licensed restaurants.
Fifty-six-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in a popular BBC series that writes a scenario and plays together with his long-term partner in comedies, Greg Hemphill.
The two men announced that the next ninth season will be the last one in the series, and it seems Kiernan plans life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he's the director of the Adriftmorn Limited company.
The actor refused to comment on the news, although the source of the Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the "raising restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours," Bolivia, who has no way out to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Navy patrol the seat in La Paz.
In public buildings, the ocean blue flags are flying.
Naval bases from Lakes Titicaca to Amazon are sticked with slogane: "We have the right to sea.
Return to the sea is our obligation."
Through the land of Bolivia, there is still a strong memory on the coast they have lost for Chile in the bloody disturbance of natural resources in the 19th century – as well as the desire to sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes may be the biggest in the last few decades, while Bolivia expects an international judicial judgment on October 1, after five years of council.
"Bolivia has caught an inflammation, in the spirit of unity and verge, and of course expects a positive result," Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the international justice court's verdict on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will judge in favour of Bolivia and claim that -- after decades of challenging negotiations – Chile has to agree on negotiations on giving Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Here's Morales, the charismatic Bolivian President of the Domoral Origin, who is in the arrival of a controversial struggle for the next year's re-election, also plays a big role in the verdict that will be brought on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it's a little likely that the court will decide for the benefit of Bolivia, and that a little of it will change even if he decides.
The United Nations body of the Netherlands has no power to allocate the Chilean territory, and it has indicated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the verdict is expressed only six months after the last arguments being heard indicates that the case "is not complicated," Paz Zarate, Chilean expert in international law, said.
And instead of progress in the Bolivian case, the last four years may have reversed it.
"The problem of the sea exit has taken away the current Bolivian authorities," Zarate said.
Morales' war rhetoric killed the rest of the Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at one point, but it will be very difficult to hold those negotiations after this.
These two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a Bolivian representative in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring a "extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the chance of "to put a point on 139 years of disagreement to mutual satisfaction," he said.
Calzadilla also denyed that Morales -- still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America -- uses the issue of sea exit as a political stack.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to the way out in the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to realize that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no disarmament until they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people will not remove nuclear weapons until they trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He invited the United States to respect the promises of data during the Singapore summit between conflicting leaders.
His comments arrived at a time when the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appears to be at the border to restart nuclear negotiations, more than three months after Singapur and meeting with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says it's just a dream that the continuation of sanctions and opposition to the US declaration by which the Korean war ends will ever throw North Korea on the knees.
Washington is not willing to agree with the declaration until Pjongjang has made significant steps towards disarmament.
And Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, the government is universal skeptical when it comes to the seriousness of Pyongyang in respect of denying the nuclear arsenal that this country is likely to see as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare the second summit of Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion magazines present the latest lines of huge hats you will soon see in the nearby trading street
If you want to increase the collection of hats or fully cover the sun, you're in the right place.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented a series of distracted huge hats on their spring magazines and summer 2019, shading all in the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely unpractical hats won Instagram this summer, and these designers showed their impressive creations on the fashion tracks.
The most excellent piece of Valentine was the overaccented hat with a wide pernate circle that swallowed the heads of the model.
Among other glossy supplements, there were adorable stones, a wizard's hat, and even ananas, but their intention is not to keep your head from cold.
Thom Browne also presented the collection of bizarre masks and it just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had our lips, and they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high-fashioned.
One creat looked like a diving equipment with a breathing and a mask, and the other reminded the ice cream corn.
And if you're among those who follow the trend of attracting attention, you're lucky.
Those who follow fashion predicts that huge hats can be found on nearby trading streets.
The huge hats came after the "La Bomba", a slammed hat with a two-foot patch stretch that was seen on many stars, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cultural brand that was designed by this very irrespective hat that swallowed social networks, sent on the track another big creation -- a slammed beach bag, which is almost as much as the model that was wearing.
The exhaustion bag of rafia and white skin lunch was highlighted by the detail of Jacquemus La Riviera's spring collection and summer of 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
The stylist of the famous Luke Armitage told F.S.S.L.: "I expect large hats and beach bags to come to the shops at the time for the next summer, since the designer left such a huge impression it would be hard to ignore the demand for pre-immediated fashion supplements."
John Edward: Knowledge of language is of key importance for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland can be commended with extraordinary academic achievements, which continued in 2018 with a new series of extraordinary results on the tests, which is further strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools representing the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), they are trying to provide the best level of services to their students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for further and more education, selected career and place in society of citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement its own class plan and program, we see modern languages are still popular and desirable choices of students in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language that understands that's good for his head.
If you speak with him in his tongue, it's good for his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely on English only if we want to build good relations and trust with people from other countries.
According to the results of the tests this year, we see the languages at the top of the League table, with the highest passage grades in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received an estimate A at the final high school exam.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of the students received evaluation A from Mandarin at the final high school examination, while 72 per cent of those who learn German, 69 per cent of those who learn French and 63 per cent of those who learn Spanish also received an evaluation of A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that will certainly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages, as electoral items, are now treated in the same way as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, machinery and mathematics) and in independent school programmes, and elsewhere.
The survey carried out by the British Employment and Employment Commission in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the reasons that employers have indicated in the difficulties of filling jobs is the lack of those who know foreign languages.
Thus, knowledge of foreign languages becomes more necessary in order to prepare young people for their future career.
With more potential jobs that need knowledge of foreign languages, this skill is necessary in the world of globalization.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if he knows another language, he will have a real advantage in the future because it's a skill for the whole life.
The art of direct communication with people from foreign countries will automatically put a person speaking more languages in front of competition.
According to the YouGov survey carried out among more than 4,000 British in 2013, 75 percent did not speak the other language well enough to speak, while French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
Therefore, investment in learning foreign languages is important to children today.
Knowing more languages, especially those used in economies in development, will give children a better chance to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, every school is different when it comes to learning languages.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for Great Britain by 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child is, there will always be several languages from which they will be able to choose in independent schools, with professional teachers in this area.
Scotland's independent schools are dedicated to the education environment that will prepare children and give them skills necessary for success, whatever happens in the future.
At this time, it cannot be denyed that in the global business environment, languages are key to the future of the country, so that it must also be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will debit for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The waiting is about to end for fans who want to see LeBron James's first show for Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James would play Sunday in a pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still don't know how many minutes they're gonna play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said at the official location of Lakers.
The reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, Twittered that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about plans in six games during the Lakers Presidency.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need seasonal swords to prepare," he said.
Trump's Collections in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump started a series of elections tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled meetings in the next week, including visits friendly intensive places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While his voice is awaited for the filling of the void place in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to increase support in the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate because the Republicans are risking to lose control of Congress after the vote in November.
When is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how can you look at it on the net?
Trump's collection in Wheeling, West Virginia was scheduled for seven hours tonight after eastern time, on Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting in West Virginia under a live transfer on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about the hearing this week about the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court in which it was tense for sexual disturbance charges, and the expected vote in the Senate was delayed in seven days until the FBI conducted the investigation.
But the excellent goal of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans achieve better results in the elections in November.
Therefore, the campaign of President Trump said that the meetings are held this week to "give energy to volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the Representative House," according to Reuters' information.
"Congress Control is so crucial part of its agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter the pre-electoral campaign season," the Portparol of the Trump campaign, who refused to present, told the Reuters.
Appointed at Westbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's meeting could gather supporters from "Ohia and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time this month Trump will visit West Virginia, a country in which he won with more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is not well in the surveys.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came to try to raise his rating in the surveys," said Simon Haeder, politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters' report.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team showed corporateness to keep hope before individual matches on Sunday
After three unilateral sessions, four of them on Saturday afternoon may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
Zamah clanta is a totally invented concept in sports, but one of those in which players truly believe, and especially in competitions like this.
What do they think, who's got a flash right now?
"They were leading six points, and now four, so it can be said that the wave is on our side," Jordan Spieth said on leave.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points more, with another twelve in the game.
The Americans, Spieth says, still believe that they have some wind in their wings, and there's a lot of things that gives them encouragement, including the forms of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each took three points of possible four.
Spieth was brilliant from the first to the last strike and leads his example.
The shouting of celebrations became increasingly loud during his round, to eventually play a key hit for the unsolved result in the fourth match when he and Thomas were delayed for two after two.
His final strike with a 15-hole match was welcomed by a similar scream, the one reflecting the faith that the American team has hopes.
"You just have to do your best and take care of your match," said Spieth.
That's all that's left to these players now.
18 holes that can bring glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of Ryder Cup.
An unusual but unusual European couple has received all four matches and a game without mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that played no gods hits on Saturday afternoon, and they escaped them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The game they showed so far and how they exchanged energy with a noise audience has been strengthened at the position of the main favorites on Sunday and there are no more popular players than Fleetwood or Molinaria who could take the potential European victory while the sun sits over the Le Golf National Club.
It's best for both of you to be on different holes at the same time.
However, it is still early to talk about the European celebration.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly conquered Sergei Garcia, a hero of four games that morning, when he played with Alex Norren.
One godly strike and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spanish and the Sweden in a hole from which they were not able to squeeze by the end.
However, on Sunday no one can help you get out of your hole.
Games with four balls and four are so fascinating to look closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give and they don't give, and the way the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a great advantage in front of the final day, but this fourth session also showed that the US team has a desire to fight that some have suspected, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe leads 10:6 before the last day Ryder Cup
Europe will enter in the last Ryder Cup with a significant advantage, since after Saturday matches in the game with four balls and fours has achieved the advantage of 10:6 over the United States.
The inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led the first with two victories over the unchanged Tiger Woods, increasing the current results in the Le Golf National Club at four points.
The Europeans of Thomas Bjorn in the fight to restore the trophy lost in the Hazeltine Golf Club two years ago, dominated over the unprecise Americans in the morning's game with four balls and won the series of 3:1.
The United States has given greater resistance to the four tournament, winning two matches, but they could not reduce the removal.
Jim Furyk's team has to win eight points in 12 individual matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debitant who won four points in a row, while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after the fantastic weekend, only the second couple in Ryder Cup history who won four points in the first four matches.
After they hit Woods and Patrick Reed in a game with four balls, they greatly composed and overcome the tired Woods and American debitant Bryson Dechambeau with even more convincing 5:4.
Woods who walked through two matches on Saturday, he shineed for a moment, but now he lost 19 out of 29 matches in the game with four balls and fours and seven in a row.
Juston Rose, who rested during the morning's game with four balls, returned to Henry Stanson at the fourth tournament and defeated 2:1 from Dustin Johnson and Broox Koepko – the first and third in the world.
Europe, however, did not work according to the plan of this pleasant every day south-west of Paris.
A triple conquer of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas's main tournament set the aim for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They have chosen a victory of 2:1 over Jonah Rahma and Ian Poulter in the game with four balls to return and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4:3 in fours, after they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder's history, a team returned after a four-point removal in front of individual matches, although Furyk's side defending the title is a sufficient unsolved result to keep the trophy.
However, since they've been two days in the second place, they seem to be unable to take an attack on Sunday.
North Korea tells us that there is no talk about one-sided disarmament unless there is trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister said on Saturday to the United Nations that the prolongation of sanctions deepens its lack of confidence in the United States and that in such circumstances the country will not unanimously renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Hu said in the United Nations annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken “significant measures in the past year to show goodwill”, such as nuclear and missile testing, nuclear polygon demonstrations and promises not to multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But, there is no appropriate United States response," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no talk about the first one-sided disarmament."
Although Ri repeated the famous complaints of North Korea against Washington's opposition to the "step" approach to denuclearisation by which North Korea would be rewarded for progressive steps, the importance of his statement was that he did not reject a unilateral denuclearisation from the game like Pyungjang before.
Ri called for a joint statement Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump at the first summit held between the current US President and North Korea leader on June 12th in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on the "denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump committed to providing North Korea's Security Guarantee.
North Korea is looking for a formal end of the Korean war (1950-53), but the United States announced that Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington also deafed the invitations to mitigate the international sanctions of North Korea.
"United States do not give up the "denuclearisation first of all" and increase the pressure of sanctions in order to achieve their goal, even opposing the "declaring the end of the war", said Ri.
"The opinion that sanctions can throw us on the knees are the empty dreams of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our untrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader spoke in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If we negotiated this problem with South Korea, rather than with the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not come into such an outstanding position."
However, the ton of Ri's speech dramatically differed from the last year, when the UN General Assembly said that the shooting of American land with North Korea's missiles was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "raketash" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations Trump, who threatened last year to "utterly destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for the courage to take disarmament steps, but said that many more things should be done and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea conducts denuclearisation.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not set the time frame for this, saying, "If it takes, let it take two years, three or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongjang for the steps they have taken.
However, US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council sanctions must continue to be strictly and without relevance to implement until the complete, final, confirmed denuclearisation."
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea that have been applied since 2006 in an attempt to prevent the financing of nuclear and ballist missile programmes in Pyongjang.
Pompeo met with Rie van the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjongjang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
In July, Pjongjang left with the words that progress was made, and North Korea sentenced him only a few hours later for the execution of "gangster requests".
North Korea has promised to demolite a rocket polygon this month, as well as a nuclear complex if the United States take "suitable measures".
He said Kim told him that "suitable measures" required by the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard attend a course about how to rest enough.
The new course at Harvard University this year aims to force students to sleep more in an effort to eradicate more popular macho culture learning "all night with caffeine".
One academic noted that students of the world's leading university are often ignorant about the basic care of themselves.
Charles Cheisler, a medicinal professor at Harvard's Medical Faculty and Specialist in Brigham and Women's Hospital, has created a course that he believes is the only one of those types in the United States.
The inspiration to launch this course was received after the speech he held on the impact of the lack of sleep on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why are you telling me this just now, in my graduation year?"
She said that no one ever told her how important the dream is -- which surprised me," the Telegraph told me.
The course that is held this year for the first time represents the basis of how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and sports results, as well as to improve their general condition.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatric professor at Harvard Medical University and executive Director of the University of Health, said the university decided to introduce a course after it was observed that students suffered from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course covers a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of rooms in a student house and students should click on cups for coffee, curtains, shoes and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of the lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of routine before sleep.
In another part, part of the participants are told that long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, brain attack, depression and cancer.
The map of campus with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that it won't change the behavior of the students at the moment.
But we believe that they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know what effects on health has the decision to smoke cigarettes," Professor Cheisler said.
The culture of pride because of the "smooth night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students led to the lack of sleep become a growing problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and that quality, should be "secret weapons" of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said -- even against a surplus pound, since the lack of sleep of the brain goes into a hunger regime, so they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a nineteen-year-old student of chemistry and physical biology from California, helped Professor Cheisler develop a course after he attended one of his classes during his first year in Harvard last year.
He says that this course opened his eyes and inspired him to support him at the entire campus level.
He hopes that the next step is that all graduates are requested to pass a similar study programme before accessing the competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommended that students think about setting alarms in time to sleep and wake up and take care of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lights and may disturb the circadianic rhythm, and thus lead to a problem with sleeping.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Mengin goal defeated Gerrard's team
The Rangers have experienced another depressed defeat in guests when Dolly Menga bulleted the team of Steven Gerrard to defeat from 1:0 of Livingstone.
The Ibrox team wanted to take the first victory in guests after the February triumph of 4:1 in St. Johnstone, but the team of Gary Holt had brought Gerrard as a manager only another defeat in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind the unattainable leaders Ladbrokes Prime Minister of League, Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time, and the uninspired Rangers' figure never came near the equation.
While the Rangers fell to the sixth place now, Livingston climbed up to the third and they're behind Hibernian just because of the nails of the difference.
The Rangers could face additional problems after a linear judge, Calum Spence, had to show help when they shot him by side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the Ayr team that took over the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was assigned to the same eleven Livingstone players who took the points of Hearts last week and would be thrilled by the way his well-trained team pressed opponents at every step.
The Rangers may have dominated with the ball, but Livingston had better use of his time with the ball.
It was a little missed to reach only two minutes after Menga first added to an empty space sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the player in the middle of the field missed a big chance and kicked by the naked.
The deep free strike of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in the defense Alan Lithgow just managed to kick next to the naked side of the static.
The Rangers succeeded in taking control, but their game in the last third gave more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought he should have received a penalty in 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless struggled, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
The Rangers did only two goals in the first half-time, but the former golfman of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, defended the head of Lassana Coulibaly without any bigger problems and cut off the shot that directed these Ejaria.
Although the first goal of Livingstone in the 34th minute may not reflect the real relationship of forces in the game, no one can dispute that he was deserved, if for nothing else, then for the invested effort.
The Rangers couldn't handle Jacobs' deep free blow again.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard responded to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly and that replacement gave almost immediately the result when the wing player hired Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran out of his line and blocked him.
However, Livingston continued to instruct guests to play just as they fit, with long balls of Lithgow and Halketta.
Holt's team had a chance to increase the advantage in the last minutes, but McGregor was holding up well and defending Jacobs' attack, so Lithgow would then send a ball by the naked corner.
The replacement player of Rangers, Glenn Middleton, asked for another penalty at the end of the game when he connected with Jacobs, but Thomson didn't react again.
Almanah: Inventor of Geiger's numerator
And now, the station from our Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882 on today's day 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactiveness, an invention that will eventually become a device known as Geiger's numerator.
Except that one of the main science scopes, Geiger's calculator has its place and in pop culture, as in the 1950 "Zvon of Koronada" film, in which they played seemingly unbelievable cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
A man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's numerator, used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these listeners on, you can hear the effects of atoms with your ears thanks to radioactivities in minerals."
Evans: "Yes, it's a pucket!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that wears his name is still alive.
A new vaccine against cancer could teach the immune system to "see" vicious cells
A new vaccine against cancer could teach the immune system to "see" vicious cells and then kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize vicious cells as part of therapy
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells from patients and their changes in the laboratory
They can "see" protein that is common in many types of cancer, and then they are injected again.
The test vaccine showed promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
The cancer of a woman's egg who received treatment with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize the vicious cells, disappeared for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their transformation in the lab so that they can "see" HER2 protein and reinject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the American Institute for Trouble Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "helps the growth of several types of cancer" including breast cancer, eggs, lungs and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
Similar access to the withdrawal of immune cells from patients and the "training" of the same how to target malignant cells was effective in treatment of a kind of leukemia.
Kanye West held a strong speech to support Trump, wearing the MAGA hat, after his performance in the SNL show.
He didn't have a good time.
Kanye West was acquired in a study during the Saturday Night Live show after a flattering show in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song called the Ghost Town, that night he wore a hat with the title "Do America a great," he offended the democrats and spoke again about his support to Trump.
"I've talked to the white people that say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?
If I had cared about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL started a sketch show in which Matt Damon played and where the Hollywood Star laughed at the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the senate judicial committee on the claims on the sexual disturbance of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the video of West's speech was divided by a comic Chris Rock on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock tried to laugh at West by putting a video.
West also complained to the audience that it was hard behind his hat.
"They've been kidding me behind the towers.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on your head."
They were kidding me!
And then they say to me I've fallen down," Washington Examiner said.
West continued, "Do you want to see what it looks like?" Adding that "wear Superman's coat because that means you can't order me. You want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments caused the audience's whistle at least twice, and the members of the SNL show were apparently ashamed, Variety passed, while one person who was present said, "The whole studio was completely silent."
West was brought in as a replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former partner, reper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many by performing the song and loved it broken into the bottle of Perrier.
Westa supported the TUS Conservative Group leader, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest souls: thank you for not withdrawing from the violents."
But Karen Hunt's show manager, she tweeted that West was just "what he really was and that it was absolutely beautiful."
"But I choose not to reward someone (such as I will buy his music or clothing or support his art), for whom I believe he has embracted and expanded ideology that harms my society.
He's free.
And we are," she added.
Before the show, the reper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, saying that now "will be previously known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist who changed his name and tracked the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A colleague Snoop Dogg called Snoop Lion, and of course a dead music legend of Prince has changed his name into a symbol, and then to "a artist previously known as Prince".

The star of the series "The Games of the throne", Kit Harrington condemned the toxic macho culture
Kit Harrington is famous by his role, Jon Snow, who beats the sword in a violent medieval fantasy, HBO series Game of the throne.
However, an actor (31) crushed into a stereotype of a hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that boys often believe that they need to be rough to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of the toxic macho of culture at the time #MeToo.
A whale who recently married a Leslie Rose's throne game, 31, acknowledged that he had a "great need" to deal with this problem.
"I am in a bit of a question at the moment -- what have we made wrong with representing maleness?" he said.
"Why do we teach men when they grow up, when it's the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for spreading the toxic macho culture for displaying characters represented as men.
He continued, "What is born, and what is the matter of raise?
What are we learning on TV and on the streets, why do young people think they have to fit into a certain pattern of man's behavior?
I think that's, in fact, one of the main issues of our era -- how do we change it?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for youths."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not agree on the preconditions or continuations of the throne game after the end of the next summer, saying "he's finished with battlefields and horses".
Kit will be acting in the theater part of Sam Shepard True West since November, stories about a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently discovered that he believed that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened in the game throne series.
"In this series I met my wife, so it can be said she gave me the future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritta, the love partner of Kit's character John Snow in this fantastic series that won Emma's prize.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's parents in Scotland.
HIV/side: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of new cases of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been hit, health officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were recorded only in the second quarter of 2018.
The large majority of new cases has been transmitted through sexual relations, which is a change in relation to the previous situation.
In the past, HIV was rapidly spread to some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions infected by the virus.
However, the number of people who receive HIV in this way is almost zero, Chinese health officials said at the Yunnan province conference.
However, from year to year, the number of people in China who live with HIV and AIDS increased by 100,000 people.
Transfer of HIV through sexual relations is a burning problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality is not considered illegal since 1997 in China, but they say that the discrimination of LGBT persons is very widespread.
Studies estimate that because of conservative concepts in the country, 70 to 90% of men who have sexual relations with men eventually get married to women.
The transmission of the virus is often due to inappropriate sexual protection in such relations.
The Chinese government promised universal access to HIV medicines in 2003 as part of the solution plan.
Maxine Waters denyed the allegations that one of her staff published information on the Republican Senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "theories of conspiracy"
US Ambassador Maxine Waters denyed that one of her staff published the personal information of three American Republican Senators on the Wikipedia pages of those legislators.
The democratic letter from Los Angeles claims that the claims are subjected to the experts and websites of the "ultraspersonal Wing".
"Lying, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a publication on Twitter.
The publications reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of American Senator Lindsey Graham from South Caroline, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday, and it was published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate Commission on the instructions on sexual disturbance against the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was released at some point after three Senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that IP address identifying the source of publications linked to Waters' office and published information on the member of her staff, said Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely incorrect and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"Article of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security are threatened by these false and incorrect claims – is not in any way responsible for disclosing these information.
This unfounded claim is completely incorrect and absolute lie."
The Waters' statement soon caused a conviction on the Internet, also the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial goes with anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests a conclusion that she has no temperament needed for a member of the Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
He can't be drunk.
He must not question the motives of the defendant.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleischer clearly compared Waters' response to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's democrat, who was accused of acting too angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who candidate to shift Waters at the middle of the mandate elections, also announced through Twitter.
"The great thing if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office warned "suitable judicial institutions and judicial authorities about these false claims".
"We will make sure the perpetrators find out," she continued, "and before the law they are responsible for all their actions that are unstable and dangerous for all members of my staff."
Review of Johnny English film again in action – milk spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has already gone into tradition to seek a subtext on Brexit in every new film with British theme, which can also be applied to this continuation of the satirical action comedy on Johnny English – which started in 2003 by realizing "Johny English" and returned to the screens in 2011 by continuing "Johny English: Reborn".
Will the ironical autocasting on how obviously useless we are going to be a new export opportunity for the nation?
Either way, an incompetent Johnny English rubber face has received a new opportunity to screw up something -- with which his name is more than anything he says that it is a general comic creation designed for a cinema audience whose English is not a native language.
It's, of course, a foolish secret agent who, despite the bizarre claims to the highest glamour, wears a little Clouseau, a bowl of Mr. Bean and a bit of that guy who played only one note in the framework of the thematic melody of the "Chariots of Fire" at the ceremony of opening Olympic Games in London 2012.
It was also originally based on a passenger and an international man covered by a secret that Atkinson used to play in the currently forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos behind.
One or two scenes of the latest is the submissions are good.
I liked when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a medium-economic knight armor and when the rotor knives sound about his helmet for a little bit.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems weak and in a very strange way overwhelming, especially now when "serious" film brands like 007 and the impossible Mission self-configuredly add the comic elements.
The impression is that it's a humour for children, not for adults, and for me the freaked adventures of Johnny English are not inventive and developed as Atkinson's gegos like the German movies in the image of Mr. Bean.
Now it is a very current theme that Great Britain is in serious problems.
Hacker infiltrated the British supersecret spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents in the field, to the horror of an agent at duty – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop in a full glass of water for a prime minister, a pomped and abused character who has already experienced a complete collapse due to the decline of political popularity: Emma Thomson has masterly played this character designed by the example of Theresa May, but the scenario is quite poor.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that all active spys are compromised and that they will have to hire one of the retired ones.
And that means a scumbag Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in some fabulous institution, but unauthorisedly keeps lessons about how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gegos when English holds a spying academy in the "Scole of Rome".
They quickly return to Whitehall to emergency instructions and reconstruct him with the former immensely patient partner Bough, whom Ben Miller plays again.
Bough is now a married man, married to the submarine commander in whose energy and noise role Vicki Pepperdine was spending a little.
So Batman and Robin are again on the service of Her Majesty's secret service and fortune to the beautiful fatal wife of Ophelia Bullet, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls in a carismatic technical billionaire trap who claims that he can solve British computer problems: the malicious Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odys of comic events: broken into waitress, burned elegant French restaurant, making chaos with a boat boarding on Walta's luxury yacht and english starts the real anarchy trying to get to know the inside of Walta's house using listeners for virtual reality.
It's obvious that a great effort has been invested in that last sequence, but no matter how nice and joyful, the whole movie is like it's made for children.
Pretty central quality.
Like the other movies on Johnny English, I can't ask myself: can the British film industry come up with a role for Rwanna Atkinsona that would really show his talent?
The Laburist Party denies the creation of a plan for the British that will work four days a week and be paid in five days.
The Lab party of Jeremy Corbyn will consider a radical plan on which the British would work four days a week, but they were paid for five.
The party apparently wants the company's bosses to transfer time to workers due to the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) by granting them another day off.
The employees would like to enjoy the three-day weekend, but they would still receive the same salary.
Sources say that the idea would "incorporate" into the party's economic programme and plans to improve the working conditions and the rights of workers.
The transition to the four-day working week approved the Syndical Congress as a way that workers can use a variable economy.
High source from the Labour Party said to Sunday Times: "The new policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day working week is an ambition that fits into the party's access to the economic rebalance for workers, as well as the party's industrial strategy at all."
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea because the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the pre-electoral campaign in 2017.
However, this ambition does not support the whole Labour Party.
The Laburist Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not a party policy, and the party does not consider it."
The Opposition Officer John McDonnell used the Laburist Party conference last week to expose his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take the power from the hands of "withouthandless directors" and "professor" in communal companies.
The opposition candidate plans also mean that current stock owners in water supply companies may not recover their entire investments because labs could impose "fresh" on the basis of observed injustices.
He also confirmed the plans to include workers in the company committees and create inclusive ownership funds that would allocate 10% of the company's values in the private sector to employees, for which it is likely to collect dividends to 500 pounds annually.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy talks about the 60-minute show about whether the FBI investigation could change their views.
The FBI investigation against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week and revokes the question whether the Bureau investigation could lead some Republican Senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview showed on Sunday, a "60 minutes" writer Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Caroline.
"I think, of course," said Kennedy.
"Before the hearing I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges appeared, I asked, ‘ Did you do it? ’
He was indecisive, decisive, undecided."
However, the voice of Senator Graham appears to be betoned.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh was formed and would be necessary a strong accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has denied it energically," Graham added, talking about Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone who she appoints can't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the festival of citizens of the world and did he do anything that would reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be a city host of the festival of citizens of the world, an annual music event with a really impressive list of stars that will be performed, and equally impressive goal – to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Festival of Citizens of the world will gather tens of thousands of people in the large lawn of the Central Park, who will not only enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of this event, which is to end to extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which was held for the first time in 2012, is a prolongation of a global project against poverty, an international group that is envisaged to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight the same.
To get a free card for the event (except if you are not willing to pay for VIP card), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do a series of tasks or "deeds", such as volunteering, sending e-mail to the world's leader, the phone call and any other meaningful way to increase consciousness of their goal – the end of poverty.
But how successful is the Citizen's world project with only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with free concert a real way to convince people to do something, or just another type of so-calctivism – when people believe that they have done something that will change the world by signing a petition on the Internet or twittering?
Since 2011, the Citizen of the World's Initiative has claimed that they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of their supporters who were in place for a series of different goals.
They say these actions have led world leaders to announce promises and political directions worth over $37 billion and will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group stated 390 promises and publications of their actions, and at least $10 billion has already been allocated or collected.
The group estimates that the funds gathered have already directly affected 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the power of food, partnership of investors and realists from Great Britain who promised "to help children grow into their full potential," promiseing that Rwanda will allocate $35 million to end the consumption in that country, after they received more than 4700 Twitters from the Citizens of the world.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, such as you are, we can make social injustice become a historical footnote," said the Ambassador of food power, Tracey Ullman, visitors of the concert live in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5000 actions that invited Britain to improve mothers and children's nutrition, the government announced that it would finance the diet power project, whose interventions will affect the lives of 5 million women and children.
In answer to one of the often asked questions on their site, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The citizen of the world answers: "It will be a long and difficult way, and sometimes we fall down and fall down.
However, as all the major movements for civil rights and against the apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just some of the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could "block" Russia in energy export by sailing the Navy – Secretary of Internal Affairs
Washington can "if necessary" use his navy to prevent the export of Russian energy to third markets, including the Middle East, discovered Ryan Zinke, US Secretary of Interior, and Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that the Russian engagement in Syria -- namely, there are legitimate government calls -- is an excuse for research in new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to the officials, there are ways and means to solve this issue.
"United States have this opportunity to ensure that the sea corridors remain open or block them as necessary to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organised by the Union of Energy Consumptors, an unprofit group that calls himself "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He did a comparison with Washington's access to relations with Russia and Iran, constating that it was the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is less or more consisting of the use and replacement of fuel," he said, saying Russia owns only one adut, and its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come after the Trump Administration's mission to increase exports of coated natural gas to Europe, replaceing Russia with a much more favourable option for European consumers.
For that purpose, the officials of Trump's administration, including the US President himself, Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” gaswater project, Northern Stream 2, which, according to Trump, would make Berlin become “control” of Moscow.
Moscow emphasized several occasions that the gas engine is the Northern Stream 2, whose value is 11 billion dollars, and which should double the existing gaswater capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusive economic project.
The Kremlj claims that the reasons for the opposition of Washington are a clear economic nature project and that is an example of unloyal competition.
"I believe we share the opinion that energy cannot be a means of exercising pressure and that consumers should have the possibility of selecting suppliers," Russian Minister Alexander Novak said after the meeting with the US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The state of the United States has caused Germany's response that reaffirmed its determination for the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the German industry Union (BDI), urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, President of the German industry's Alliance (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "treat" the presidential candidacy for 2020, Senator Masachusetts said
Senator of Masachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "consciously consider" running for president after the next medium-term elections.
During a meeting in the City Council in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider the candidature.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, which includes a woman at the top," she said, and she transmits the source of The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will think seriously about running for the president."
Warren called on President Donald Trump during a meeting in the city council, saying "he's running this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was called for criticizing Trump and his candidate for Judge of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In her tweet she published on Friday, Warren said "naturally we need a FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the results of the survey published on Thursday showed that most election bodies voted for Warren do not think that it should be running in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the voters who will "probably" vote in Massachusetts state said that the senator should not be running, according to the survey conducted by the Centre for Political Research of the University of Suffolk/list Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed that there was greater support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent of voters supporting potential candidacy and 48 per cent against candidacy.
Other sound names from the order of democrats discussed in terms of their potential candidacy in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, as the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talked about Track Palin's PTSP at the Donald Trump's support gathering
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruitment in September.
He was arrested and accused of family violence after the incident that happened on Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after return, I can connect with what happens to other families suffering from the consequences of PTSP and vulnerability that our soldiers return," she said to the public at the expensive support of President Donald Trump in Tulsa, in Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "hot theme" and, speaking about her son and other war veterans, she added "they are coming back a little different, they go back harder, wondering if there is respect for what their companions soldiers and pilots have given, and all other members of the army for this country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was accused of violence in the family -- attack on a female person, distraction of family violence and possession of weapons under opium, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Police Management of Wasilla.
18 countries, D.C. support the dispute of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the review of the new U.S. policy that reduces asylum to victims running from gangs or domestic violence.
The representatives of 18 states and District filed a friendly report to the court on Friday in Washington in order to support asylum seekers who dispute this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in the lawsuit of Grace against the sessions which the American Union for Civil Freedoms filed in August was not discovered.
She said she was abused by her partner "and the violent members of his gang," but US officials rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace explained how El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala countries, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, are facing a growing problem with gangs and family violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has cancelled the decision of the Committee for Appeals of Immigrants in 2014, which enabled immigrants who have no documents and fled from domestic violence, to file an asylum request.
The state prosecutor of District Columbia, General Carl Racine, said in his statement on Friday that the new policy "neglects decades of state, federal and international law."
"The Federal Law requires that all asylum requirements be decided on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the requirement, and thus the chamber breaks the principle," the friendly report states.
The lawyers further in the report argue that the police that prevents immigrants from entering the U.S. economy, and that they will probably become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
In June, the prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges in migrant cases to no longer asylum to victims fleeing from violence in the family and violence of gangs.
"Azil is only available to those who leave their homelands because of persecution or fear because of the nature of a certain race, religion, nationality or a certain social group or because of their political opinion," the Sessions said in the statement of 11 June speaking of politics.
The purpose of asylum was never to mitigate all problems, even all serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palo while the number of dead is doubled in search for survivors
The survivors' situation is getting worse.
"It's very tense," said the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma comforting her sick little boy in the evacuation center in the desolate city of Palo.
"Each minute, the ambulance brings the bodies.
The government of the poor water."
The inhabitants return to their disordered homes, scattering around flooded things trying to save everything they can find.
There are hundreds of people injured, and the hospitals destroyed by a earthquake of 7.5 degrees have been suffered.
Some of those injured as Dwi Harris who have broken their back and shoulder were placed outside the Military Hospital of Palua, where patients were provided outside because of continuous strong restraining earthquakes.
His eyes are full of tears when he talks about a strong earthquake that shakes the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed by the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press Agency, adding that his family was in town because of the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying calling for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of the "violence of propaganda ads"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published an ad on four pages in the U.S. daily newspaper, praising the mutual benefit of the trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US propaganda press.
US President Donald Trump considered on Wednesday a paid supplement of Chinese newspapers China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most selling newspapers in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering with the US Congress elections that will take place on November 6th, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere with American elections marks, as US officials said to the Reuters agency, a new phase in the escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
And while it is usual that foreign governments publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war where they increase their tariffs to import each other.
As contrary, Chinese tariffs in this trade war have been focused on exporters in countries such as Iowa, which support the Trump Republican Party, said in Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador in China and former long-year Mayor of the Iowa State, who is the chief exporter of agricultural goods in China, said that Beijing damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a comment published in the Sunday publication of Des Moines Register, "now doubles this violence by publishing promotional advertising in our free press."
"With its propaganda, the government of China exploits the precious American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of press, placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register newspaper," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the kiosk that is here down the street in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any real reflection of the different views that people in China may have on the problemious economic path of China, bearing in mind that Chinese media are under the strong stick of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to publish its article, even though he did not mention which newspapers are being dealt with.
The Republicans distract women from voting in front of medium-term elections with the Kavanaugh debacle, warn analysts
Analysts warned that a large number of the most emphasized Republicans who are defending and standing with the candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faced several accusations of alleged sexual attacks, would experience negative reactions, especially women, during the coming medium-term elections.
The emotions linked to this issue are very intense and most Republicans already show that they want to give their vote.
There is no back in these matters," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School of Syracuse University, in a magazine published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected that the fact that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) asked the FBI's investigation would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a higher adviser and State spokesman of the MoveOn Progressive Group, says in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators shouted "November coming!" during the senate hall demonstration, while the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to endure with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be enormous," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, said.
"People say he's already high, which is true.
But he could be higher, especially among undecisive female voters in suburbs and young voters between 18 and 29 years old, who although they don't like the president, don't vote."
Even before the public testimony of Ford, in which she stated the details of the alleged sexual attack against the candidate for the Supreme Court judge, the analysts thought that there could be negative reactions if the Republicans persisted with appointment.
"This has become a big mess for the Great Old Party," Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, transmitted NBC News network.
"It's not only about the vote of the Committee or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it is also about the way the Republicans solved the issue and how they treated it," Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities Group, which supports the choice of democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided in respect of whom to trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slight incline on the side of Kavanaugh.
New YouGov survey shows that 41% of the investigators definitely or likely believe in the testimony of Ford, while 35% said that they definitely or probably trust Kavanaugh.
Besides, 38% said that Kavanaugh thought he probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said that they thought the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the indications made by Ford and at least another person who filed the charge, Deborah Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
Ford testified in front of the Senate Justice Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunk state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez allegedly claims that the candidate for Judge of the Supreme Court showed her its genitalities while they attended the party during their studies in Yale 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to run a new Internet that will overcome Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launchs a startup aimed at being a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid, whose creation is Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to which information.
In the exclusive intelligence for Fast Company, Berners-Lee was kidding that the intention of Inrupt was “the world domination”.
"We must do it right away," he said speaking of the startup.
"This is a historical moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data store" or the Pod (personal online data store).
It can contain a list of contacts, a list of obligations, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, they're all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique for the personal data store on the network is that it is completely dependent on the user who can access some types of information.
The company calls it "personal reinforcement through data."
According to the chief director, John Bruce, the idea is that the Inrupt company provides sources, processes and suitable skills so that Solid will be available to everyone.
The company currently represents Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM security platform, a number of employees of developing engineers engaged to work on the project and the community of volunteer developers.
Since this week, technology engineers around the world can create their decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models overnight will be completely destroyed.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post from Saturday on Medium Platform, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupta "is a mission to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect integrity and quality of the new website built on Solida."
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded a World Wide Web Consortion at the Institute for Technology Massachusetts.
Recently, Berners-Lee has been a very influenced voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although initiating Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortion, Web and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The celebration of Victoria's cross assigned to a priest in World War I
They celebrate in the honor of the only priest of the English Church, who was depicted by Victoria's cross as a fighter in the First World War, was convenient in his birth city for 100 years later .
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won a recognition on September 29, 1918 for a attack at the towns of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a few days later, he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he won the greatest British military confession.
On the parade held in Rushden on Saturday, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren discovered the memorial panel.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that “incredibly symbolic ” was that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years after the award for which his grandfather received the prize.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Channel Saint-Quentin "with a very dense fog and under strong shooting from the battlefield and a mineral fire."
Later, he hurried to the fire line, and with “the greatest heroism ” he led the lead forward before he rushed without any help to the Polish top and slaughtered three of the military squad.
Lieutenant Vanna was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s moves were “what I know I could never achieve, but also something that causes obedience. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also lay down a vein after the parade that was led by the tournament orchestra Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that “he feels honored to participate in the parade ” and added that“ the braveness of the true hero shows the support that many will give. ”
The MMA fans who stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead get Pep of Prass
Imagine that, you've been awake all night to watch a series of Bellator 206, so that you can eventually disable the main event.
The program from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main list and showed it live during the night on Channel 5 in Great Britain.
At 6:00 a.m., just the moment Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face, the Watchers in Great Britain were amazed when the transfer broke down the Pep Prass.
Many were not impressed that they stayed awake all night until early morning just because of the fight.
One fan at Twitter described this interruption of transmission by a painted film as a "some kind of sick joke."
"It's about the government regulation where it states that at 6 a.m. that the content is inappropriate, and they had to replace it with a child programme," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President Bellator for Market and Communications, on the issue of transfer.
"Peppa pig," yes."
The president of the company Bellator Scott Coker said he would work on his schedule to include audience from Britain in the future.
"I think when I'm talking about reprising, I think we can probably solve this," Coker said.
"But the transfer is there at six a.m. on Sunday, and we will not be able to realize anything until we have Sunday, when they will be on Monday.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when there was an interruption, they circulated the receipts and they were all enemy.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical defect.
But it wasn't, it was about the government's jurisdiction.
I can promise you that this won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, we've tried to give more to our fans, but we've overreacted.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but it gave him motivation to be successful.
A 24-year-old man said he only realized in high school that "not everyone's like me."
Speaking at the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs represented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was openly talking about gay rights to give "nade."
He also said that what he became a parent made him less concerned about the victory in the Olympics.
The regular leader of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, was absent for a few months because of the disease.
By appearing as a wasteman in Laverne's first show, Daley said that during growing up, he felt "minor" than others because "It was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of less value and feeling that I was different were the real things that gave me power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "one," he said, so that people do not disappoint themselves when they eventually learn about his sexuality.
Double winner of bronze olympic medals became a very important fighter for the LGBT population and used his appearance in this year's Games of Commonwealth in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he considered himself happy that he had the opportunity to speak publicly without consequences and because he wanted to give others “the hope. ”
The triple world champion said that falling in love with a man, American producer Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "has surprised him."
Daley married the winner of Oscar, who was 20 years older, last year, and said that the difference in ages was never a problem.
"When you live so much as you are so young," -- the first time he appeared at the Olympics when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who experienced similar rises and falls.
A couple realized the role of the boy's parents Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his "all perspective" changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was only that "I have to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals in the Olympic Games.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 in the 40th year after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he would die and that one of the last things he asked was if they still had tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be here to sit in first row, Dad," he said.
"I held him for my hand while he stopped breathing and only when he really stopped breathing and when he was dead I finally realized he was not invincible," he said.
Next year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I dreamed about all my life - to swim in front of the home audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It served as an inspiration for his choice of the first song - the proud of Heather Small - who responded in it while he was preparing for the Olympiada and from which he was still passing through.
Desert Island Discs is on Radio 4 BBC on Sunday at 11:15 by British summer weather.
Mickelson out of the form on a bench on Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he's playing his 47th game on Ryder Cup, but he'll have to restore the form so that this isn't a weak turn.
Mickelson, who plays on the biennale for the record 12th time, Captain Jim Furyk sent to the bench in Saturday games with four balls and four games.
Instead of being in the center of action, as it was often for the United States, the five-year-old winner spent the day in cheering and improving the range in the game, hoping to correct what disturbs him.
This 48-year-old, who has never been the best player, even at the top of his career, is not an ideal choice for the demanding field of Le Golf Nationala, where the long inadequate territory regularly punishes screwed strikes.
And if I'm not enough scary, Mickelson is facing the ninth game on Sunday with the British Open champion, Francesco Molinarius, who won all their four games this week with the starter Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 single games with four points less, get to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he trusted his man, but he couldn't say anything more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, crushed me on his shoulder and hugged me, and said he would be ready by tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He strongly believes in himself.
He's a member of the House of Famouss and has contributed so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't imagine playing two games.
I imagined there was more of them, but that's how it worked, and we thought it had to go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will get Nick Fald's record on the number of Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
That could mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup where he never fully reached the level of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven half-times, even though Furyk said his presence had brought a certain non-material value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, he likes to joke with people and it's great to have such a guy in the team," he explained.
"I think younger players were fun to give him a chance, and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the huge advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, from experience, knows that a significant advantage in the last day of the Rider Cup can easily be converted into an uncomfortable experience.
The first time he showed up at the game played in Valderram in 1997, when the side whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had the advantage of five points over the Americans, but they finished the competition with a tight distinction of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding that we had a great advantage in Valderrama, we had a great advantage in Brooklin where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won," said Bjorn, intentionally after he saw the team in 2018 who won the results of 5-3 on Friday and yesterday led 10-6 on Le Golf National field.
So history and everyone in that team will show me this isn't over.
You're going to the end tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win this trophy, and it remains focused on it.
All the time I'm talking, I'm focused on 12 players on our side, but we're very well aware of what's on the other side, the biggest players of the world."
He's thrilled by his players on a heavy golf tournament, Bjorn added, "I'd never let this take me.
Tomorrow's a new day.
Tomorrow's a row of individual games, and that's something else.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, you're testing the extreme possibilities of yourself as a golf player.
That's the message you have to send to the players - give the most of you tomorrow.
You're leaving your partner now, and he also has to make the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague Jim Furyk will ask their players to play better individually than they played in couples, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four points.
Surik himself was at both of those great turns last day, since he was part of a victory team in Brooklyn before he ended as a loser after Europe performed "the miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he replied when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the start as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When it starts with such a quarrel, it creates a big pressure on high games.
We formed our position in line with that, and we prepared the boys so we can try to make some magic tomorrow, you know."
Thomas has been assigned to try to lead an attack and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the upper half.
"I went with this group of boys in this position because I think she can cover up all the way to the end," Bjorn said about choosing singling players.
New German warship again waiting
The new German Navy fregate was to be released in 2014 to replace older warships from the Cold War, but it will not be arrived in at least another year because of systems and extraordinary costs, local media reported.
The release of the ship “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the leading ship in the class of completely new Baden-Wuerttemberg fregata, was delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoted by the army spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but problems after delivery threatened the fate of this ambitious project.
Four Navy ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen fregate class.
As far as known, they will have a strong gun, a series of aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as radar, infrared and acustical signatures reduced.
Other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible the latest fregate schedules for up to two years without returning to maternal ports.
However, continuous delays mean that the most modern warships, which were to allow Germany to distribute powers outside its territory, will already be exhausted at the time they were used, says Die Zeit.
The unhappy F125 fregate arrived last year in the newspaper, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipbuilding in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the ship builder after delivery.
It is a little known about the reasons for returning, but the German media indicated a number of key "software and hardware shortcomings" that would cause the ship, if it had been scheduled to a fighting mission, to be unused.
Software deficiencies were of particular importance because Baden-Wuerttemberg's ships will run the crew of about 120 sailors -- exactly half of the numbers of people managed by the old Bremen class fregats.
Furthermore, it turns out that the ship is significantly too heavy that reduces its impact and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
It is believed that 7,000 tonnes of heavy Rheinland-Pfalz ship is twice the weight of ships similar to the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to the incorrect hardware, the cost of the complete project, including the training of staff, also becomes problematic.
There are rumours that it has reached an incredible 3,1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) compared to the initial 2.2 billion.
The problems related to the latest fregates are particularly important in light of recent warnings that the naval power of Germany is reduced.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Chairman of the German Parliamentary Committee for Defence, admitted that the Navy is actually "closing out of ships that can be distributed".
The official said that this problem grew up in time, because the old ships were cancelled and no substitute ships were arrived.
He complained that none of the fregats from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund listens to the secret life of the squirrel
A new study conducted on one property in the hills of Scotland aims to find out how squirrels use landscape to look for food.
The results are expected to throw a new light on the behaviour of the only flying tits and serve as a guide in future preservation activities.
The study conducted by scientists from the National Fund of Scotland will be followed by ordinary squirrels and type of soprano Pipistrelle, and brown long-eyed squirrels and squirrels of Daubenton in the gardens of Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
The special recording device will be set on key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the slippers throughout the season.
Employed and NHS volunteers will also conduct mobile research using manual detectors.
Expert analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the calling of the slippers and what they do.
Then a map of accommodation and a report will be produced to create a detailed picture of their behavior at the level of landscape.
Rob Dewar, a Nature Adviser in NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas are the most important places for the slippers and how each kind uses them.
This information will help for the fortress to be used in the management of accommodations, such as the creation of livadas, and which is the best way to maintain the woods for slippers and other related species.
The population of squirrels in Scotland and the United States has significantly reduced during the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development, which have a negative impact on the beds and the loss of accommodation.
The wind and lighting can also be a risk, including a sticky paper and a chemical processing of construction material, and the attacks of cats.
The squirrels are actually not blind.
However, because of their habits to hunt at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes in capturing the harvest.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to locate bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, who worrys about more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 ha countries throughout the country, takes very seriously the slippers.
There are ten trained experts doing regular checks, inspections of beds and sometimes rescue.
The organization even established the first and only reservation for squirrels in Scotland at Threave's property in Dumfries and Gallowey, which are home for eight of the ten types of squirrels in Scotland.
The estate manager David Thompson says the property is an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a large area for slippers," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of ancient trees and all the good places.
But there are so many things that are not known about the slippers, so what we're doing here and on other propertys will help us better understand what they need to make progress."
He emphasizes how important it is to verify whether the mushrooms are on the property, because it is possible that the accidental destruction of one mother's leg kills up to 400 females and young people, which will likely result in the extinction of the entire local population.
The squirrels are protected animals and the law prohibits their killing, abuse, disturbance or destruction of their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's Scotland's Storage Fund Officer, has encouraged the public to engage and help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our slippers, and we just don't know how the population of most of our species is developing. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has been accused of rape that he has referred to as "fake news," saying that people "will promote" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who published charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping a American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas 2009.
Apparently after that, he paid her $37,000 to silence this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Turning to his companions who were 142 million in the video on the Instagram Live network, a few hours after the complaint report, Ronaldo, 33, criticised reports by calling them "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," a five-time conquer of the Golden ball said in the camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain glory talking about me, but that's part of work.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added smiling.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Speegel for these allegations, which they called "inadmissible reporting of doubts in the area of privacy," according to the Reuters Agency.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "nematerial damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the past years".
Apparently, the incident occurred in June 2009 in the hotel hotel Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After the nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorg allegedly returned to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her analytically, according to documents delivered to the District Court of Clark in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo kneels on his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was a "99% good boy" whom the "1%" failed.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that a couple had sex, but that he was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt "the fear of revenge" and was worried "will be humiliated publicly."
34-year-old girl says she's now looking for annulment of the settlement because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the edge to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time that allegedly happened, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juva to 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will regret forever for losing car manufacturers
The UK will "withever regret" if the world's leader's status in the production of cars after Brexit, the Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that what Toyota UK said about BBC -- if Britain left the EU without an agreement that it would temporarily stop production in its plant in Burnastone, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on borders in case Bexit remains without agreement could cause a loss of jobs.
The Burnastone factory manufactured by Toyotin Auris and Avensis produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain gets out of the EU at the end of March, we will see the stop of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director-General of Toyote in Burnastone.
Other UK producers, including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rovera, have expressed fear of how cross-border trade will function if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement.
BMW, for example, says he'll close his mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main fears relate to what car manufacturers call risks in the procurement chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
The Toyote Manufacturing Line functions on the principle "on time", where parts arrive every 37 minutes from the suppliers from the UK and the EU for cars made by order.
If the United States leaves the EU without a agreement on 29 March, there may be a breakdown on the border, which can lead to delays and shortcomings of parts according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the supplies longer than one day in his factory in Derbyshire, they said from the company, so the production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that the Chequers plan offering Theresa May for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We need to have an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow as I say, not only to enjoy the current success but also to grab this opportunity," Radio 4 in BBC today said.
"For example not only Toyote but other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely capable of continuing what has been extremely successful in the supply chains."
Toyota couldn't tell how long the production would be suspended, but she warned that long-term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory on the market and eventually reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnastone for 24 years and the president of the union union union, said his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, when such jobs are closed, they never return.
The rapporteur of the Government said: "We must present a precise and persuasive plan of our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, say from the White House
A very important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred for another week" because the fight on the candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is supervising the work of a special advisor Robert Mueller, investigating the case of Russian involvement in elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and the potential distractions of justice by the President.
Whether Trump will dismiss the Deputy General Prosecutor or not, and that would endanger Mr. Mueller's independence, it is for months a topic of speaking in Washington.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein also discussed a sound to record talks with Trump and the possibility of changing the president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein dismissed these rumors.
But last Monday, he was in the White House, in the middle of the rumors that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he wouldn't want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a breakdown with the hearing of the Senate Justice Commission on which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Trump ordered the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh's charges for a week, which further delayed the vote of the Senate in full composition.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on the Fox News channel on Sunday.
On the question of a meeting with Rosenstein, she answered: "The date for this is not yet established, that could be this week, and it could be delayed for another week, bearing in mind all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like the press always to be informed."
Some journalists would renounce this claim: Sanders did not hold a short talk for journalists in the White House since September 10th.
Chief Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the smaller number of short talks did not result in the opposition to the theater behaviour of the television journalists, even though she said, "I will agree with the fact that they are exaggerating."
Then she said that direct contact between Trump and the press would be strengthened.
"The President holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she said without indications: "We have seen these numbers."
Short talks will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has an opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this as much as possible and you've seen us doing it for the past few weeks, and those talks with the President of the United States will replace short talks to the press."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences during the official visit.
The single press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, acting in front of the gathered journalists unconstablely and occasionally strangely.
Health Minister writes to EU employees in the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland on fears related to Brexit
The Health Minister wrote to EU employees working in Scotland NHS to express the gratitude of the state and the desire to remain after Brexit.
Member of the Scotland Parliament, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before the United Nations retreat from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already committed to reconciliating the costs of resolved demands for the status of EU citizens working in its decentralized public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU on retreat have continued during the summer, and decisions are expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also expedited its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this was a very disturbing time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of every staff member, regardless of his nationality.
EU colleagues, and broader, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which benefits from patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we really want you to stay here."

The defense team of State Tigers Tennessee, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he injured his head on Saturday defeat 31:27 from the Vanderbilt Commodores club, reports Mike Organ from Tennesseean.
The Chief Coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the injury had happened just before half-time.
"He came to the field line and just crashed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the ground before they put it on the noses and took him to further interrogation.
The Tennessee State official told Chris Harris from the WSMV Nashville channel, Tennessee, that Abercrombie ended the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that “there are no details of the type/about injury” and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury happened.

He had five total bullets on Saturday before he left the game, reaching a total of 18 bullets in the season.
Foreign customers will charge bigger taxes for buying real estate in the UK
Buyers from foreign countries will be charged with bigger taxes in buying real estate in the UK, with additional funds to be used to help homeless according to new conservative plans
This move will neutralize the success of Corby's efforts to attract young voters
Greater taxes will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The safe expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year - for helping homeless
Foreign customers will charge bigger taxes for buying real estate in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless, the Theresa May will be published today.
This step will be considered to be an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn has achieved by trying to attract young voters to promise that it will provide accessible housing and focus on those who earn more.
The bigger taxes will be charged to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional money to strengthen the government's intention to fight sleep in open.
Additional compensation, which is next to the existing tax, including more levels, introduced two years ago to another real estate and purchase for rental, could be even 3%.
The safe expects this move to increase income to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the newly built real estate in London buy people who have no residential place in the UK, making prices grow, and the buyers who buy real estate first become more difficult to become householders.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "grounds of ghosts" because of a large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time outside the country.
New policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in taxi to help a larger number of young people reach their first home.
He accused construction firms to hold high prices of real estate by buying the land they don't use first, and asked Ms. May to quit the quotas as soon as possible for accessible houses to stop the British 'happiness of the housing policy'.
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rental control and suspension by no caused deposition.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new houses.
Ms. May said: "Latest year I said that I would devote my mandate to return the British dream - that life of every new generation should be better.
And that means fixing our bad housing market.
Britain will always remain open for people who want to live, work and build life in it.
However, it can't be right that individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign companies can buy houses easily as worthy British.
The dream of ownership over the house has become too far for many people, and the unman's sleep on open and still real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland."
The Chief of Sunderland Jack Ross says his "end-on ambition" is to be a Scottish representative manager at a certain point.
Forty-two-year-old Scott enjoys the challenge of returning to the life of the Northeast Club, currently located in the third place in the First League, with three points less than the leading.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after St. Mirren returned to the Scottish Prime Minister League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was in B-tim and that was it," Ross told the Sportsound BBC Scotland show.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and that always dragged me back.
However, such an opportunity would only be provided if I was successful in the club management."
Ross' precedents as Sanderland's managers include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of the Alloa Athletic club says he didn't feel peace because he came after so big names in such a big club, after he refused offers Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The measure of my success at this point will be in it" will I be able to get this club back to the Prime Minister's League? "
According to the structure and options of this club, it is undoubtedly belonging to the Prime League," he said.
"It's not easy to bring him there, but I think I can only be considered successful if I can get the club back where it belongs."
Ross is only in the third year of his managerial career, after the period he spent as a assistant of the boss in Dumbarton and 15 months spent as part of Harts' coach staff.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the fall into the third category, and St. Miren pulled off the edge of falling into the lower League to the Championship winners of the next season.
And Ross says now he feels more comfortable than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a real crossing," Alloa recalled the downloading of the club.
"I honestly believed that the management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I wasn't bad, I've made good money, and I enjoyed some solid successes.
But playing can be hard.
There's so much that you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in the sense of stress and job pressure, but the management just fits me.
I've always wanted to take care of the management and now I've been doing it, in my adult life, I haven't felt more comfortable than now."

The summer wave of heat increased the traffic of British pubs fighting for survival, but increased pressure on the restaurant chains.
In a group of pubs and bars, an increase in sales of 2.7% in July, but the traffic in restaurants fell by 4.8%, as the figures indicated.
Peter Martin, a CGA consultant, who collected data, said: “The lasting suntime and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Championship contributed to a similar pattern as the last month of June, when the pubs achieved a growth of 2.8%, and the restaurants had even greater decline.
Traffic drop in restaurants of 1.8% in June just got worse in July.
Pabs and bars focused on drinks have achieved far the best results with increased growth in comparable results from the previous period than the fall of traffic in restaurants.
Pabs focused on food were also killed by the sun, but not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to get out for a drink.
In the pubs and bars, a sale of drinks has been increased by 6.6% per month, with a decrease in sales of food by three percent."
Paul Newman, from the RSM Analysis Agency for Funny Contents and Hospitals, said: “This results continue the trend that we testify since April's end.
The weather and impact of major social and sports events are still the main factors when it comes to sale on the market outside the household.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight hard, although the sales drop of 4.8% at the annual level will be particularly painful with already present price pressures.
A long hot summer could not come up at a worse time for guests focused on food, and the time will show whether the moderate temperatures we had in August would provide a little more relief than the necessary."
The total growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly open facilities, was 2.7% in July, reflecting slower introduction of new brand growth.

Every fifth child has a secret warrant on social networks hiding from his parents
Every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret warrant on social networks hiding from their parents and teachers, discovers research
Study covering more than 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of "fake Insta" pages
This news has increased fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said he had a "main" warrant showing to his parents
Every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, is making commissions on social networks that he hides from adults.
Study covering 20,000 high school students revealed a sudden increase in the “fake Insta” as regards the Instagram Photo Sharing page.
These news have increased the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said he had a clean "main" warrant showing to his parents, but also had private warrants.
One mother who met the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who calls the other to say "power me."
The study carried out by the United Nations Digital Awareness and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of independent schools revealed that 40% of children from 11 to 18 years of age had two profiles, while half of them admitted that they had private tasks.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing the fact that so many teenagers come in temptation to create space on the Internet where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be a "sports vote" in the Scotland Athletic Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scotland Athletic Committee as an inexecutive director at the annual congregation of that administrative body.
Doyle is the most awarded Scottish athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who have sports to benefit from her rich experience gained at international level during the past decade
"Eilidh enjoys great respect for the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that the sports athletic in Scotland will benefit greatly from its membership in the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to be a sports voice and I hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland. ”
The American, who won a total of four Olympic gold, including the winning of 200 and 400 meters in the games in the Atlanta in 1996, and now he is a regular expert at BBC, remained immediate after he experienced a transitory ishemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: “I suffered a brain attack a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time can show if I'm going to recover and how much.
It was a hard job, but I was completely recovered, I learned to walk again, and I was doing agility exercise today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for a traitor in which mothers compare with cows shared opinions on the Internet
The company that produces traitors shared opinions on the Internet by a breast advertising compared with cows of musars.
In order to mark the launching of the product described as “first silent traitor”, Elvie’s consumer technology company published an advertisement inspired by a fun music video showing the freedom that the new pump provides to mothers who issue milk.
Four real mothers dance in the barn between the shadow and the cows with a song which says: "Yes, I am familiar, but I don't have a tail," and "If you didn't notice, but it's not my breasts."
The refren follows: “Pump, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, pump myself. ”
However, the advertising published on the Facebook website of the company has caused controversies on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, he saw a variety of reactions from the viewers, while many said that he was throwing light on the "the horrible" milk industry.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
And they must be pregnant and born like us to produce milk, but their babies are abducted by them a few days after birth," someone wrote.
Elvie's extradition pump is discreetly stood in the breastwear (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else commented: “It is clear that it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why don't they use them to advertise a traitor for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Somebody else added: “The saying without any sense. ”
Others stood in the defense of the advertisement, and one woman admitted that her song was "unbessful".
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy this if I still did.
Because of treason, I felt just like a cow.
The advertisement's a little foolish, but I figured it out right.
This is a genius product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “This is a funny advertisement focused on mothers who are betraying milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like “cows. ”
This isn't a commercial that praises or where the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were dancing all with discreet pumps hidden in their chest.
The concept of the advertisement is based on knowing that many mothers who betray milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is totally insensitive, there is no wire or pipe, and it stands in the breast breast, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies, and even exits while they betray milk.
Anne Balarin, a partner and an executive creative director at Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is so revolutionary product that deserves bold and provocative launch.
By pulling the parallel between breast and the cow of musars, we wanted to focus on the issue of milk and all the challenges that go along with it, showing a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new pump provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump got into the newspaper titles.
During the Sunday of Mode in London, the mother of two children appeared on the track in the creation of Marta Jacobowska using this product.
A hundred migrant children secretly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of detained children of migrants increased, although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly and because acute rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made the finding of children difficult.
Traditionally, most custodians were migrants themselves without documents fearing to endanger their residue in the country by steping forward to accepting the child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adult members of their household would have to give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration services.
Matthew Albence, a senior official from the Immigration and Customs Service, said in front of the Congress last week that the service was arrested by dozens of people who signed up for custody of minors without escort.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had not been convicted before.
"Nearly 80% of those who are either guardians or members of the custody household are illegal in this country, and a good part of them are strangers who have committed criminal acts.
So we'll continue searching for those people, Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to get children through the procedure faster, the officials introduced new rules to which some of them will have to appear before court within a month of detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, say the employees in the accommodation.
Many will call a video call instead of personally, so that the immigration judge will ask for the illegality of their status.
Those who are determined not to meet the conditions will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain closed, the more prospects that they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to anger or escape attempts, emphasize recruitment workers and reports that have come from the system for the past months.
The lawyers say that such risks are increased in larger institutions such as the city of Tornillo, where it is much easier to overlook signs that indicate that the child has problems.
They added that moving children into a tentless city without enough time to be emotionally prepared or to say goodbye to friends can cause a trauma that many children are already fighting.
Syria demands an urgent withdrawal of American, French and Turkish occupational forces
In addressing the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem also called on Syrian refugees to return, although the war in that country has lasted eight years.
Moulem, who is also in the position of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally in the Syrian country, under the excuse for the fight against terrorism and "will count on them in the right way."
They must immediately and unconditionally withdraw," he said at the session.
Moulem insisted that in Syria, “the war against terrorism is almost over”, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "holy fight until we destroy all Syrian terrorists", including terrorist groups and "every foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, primarily in charge of training and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this country destroyed by war.
With regard to refugees, Moulem said that there are good conditions for their return and accused the "individuals of the Western country" to "promote irrational fears" that encourage refugees not to return.
"We invited the international community and the humanitarian organisation to enable these returns," he said.
"They politicize what should be a pure humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that it will not be helpful to renew Syria until Assad and the opposition reach a war ending agreement.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of the tampon-zone in the last larger rebellion base in Idlib created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey agreement dismissed the major attack of Syrian forces supported by Russia in a province in which three million people live.
Moulem, however, stressed that the agreement had "jassy deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action against dżihadists and fighters from the front of Nusra related to Al Kaida would be "extermined".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Misstura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of the new committee consisting of the authorities and members of the opposition to make a draft post-launch constitution for Syria and prepare a road to elections.
Moulem has provided the terms of the Government of Syria for participation in the work of the committee, saying that the work of the body should be limited to “constitutional considerations” and warned of the possibility of external involvement.
Why Trump will be elected for a second mandate
In that logic, Trump would be re-elected in the 2020 elections unless many liberal viewers likely hope for revocation and scandal sooner terminate his mandate.
That would undoubtedly be the "the dramatic end of the presidential mandate all the time!"
So far, there's no sign of the spectacle's tiredness.
Since 2014, the shopping rating has doubled more than 1.05 million on CNN channel and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC channel.
According to Nelsen, the Fox News channel has a average of 2.4 million audiences in a deadline, unlike four years ago, when they were 1.7 million, and Rachel Maddow Show channel MSNBC overrides the rating of cable channels with 3.5 million viewers during the night with hit news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," Neal Baer drama producer "Elected survivors" said at the ABC channel, the government secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a long-year writer of comedy and author of the book “Only funny parts: and a few cruel truths about inserting into the Hollywood boys club”, has a different theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she'd vote for Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, "because he laughs me," Ms. Scovell told me.
The chaos also has a fun value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories from Washington can decide the future of the law on the abortion of Roa against Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to connect and what the global economy will be.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you went a little further from general information when you realized that you were watching a panel of experts six hours discussing how Bob Woodward used sources of "deep background" for his book "Strash," about Paul Manforth's jacket of a shoe worth $15,000, "a suit with a thick fashion," wrote Washington Post, and the implications of painting descriptions, this, anatomies, Mr. Trump, which is giving Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never see Super Mary with the same eyes again.
"The part of what he does is to see it as a reality show is that you are feeded by something every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director Wheelhouse Entertainmenta and the manufacturer of the show "Player", commenting on the rotation of the actress and daily confusion of Trump's show (critical American football league, comming Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, or you're out of line.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, in front of his home on the north coast of the island of Kauai, it was sunned at approximately 80 degrees (27°C), but he closed himself inside and watched MSNBC and filmed CNN at the same time.
He couldn't separate himself from the screen, not until Brett Kavanaugh was ready to face the Senate Justice Commission, and his future in the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember when we used to do all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large inflows of money from side in the most uncertain medium-term election race for the Representation House
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania experiences a flood of money, thanks to the re-deployment of the Congress districts, resulting from two candidates in the race for the same place.
Recently the end of the district borders in Pittsburgh's predecession led to the elections of the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who came to the lead of the second district after an emergency election last spring.
Lamb fights another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely compounded with the new 17th district.
The tickets were reimbursed after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally formed for the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has launched a fight for funding campaigns between the main parties' funding collectors, the Committee collecting funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in widely viewed special elections for the 18th Congress District of Pennsylvania in March.
That position has been held by the Republican over a decade, and President Donald Trump won a 20-point district.
Political analysts have given a minor advantage to democrats.
The United States considers the punishment of El Salvador for supporting China, but then retreat
Diplomats have stated that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with a few incentives from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heartfelt meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump's management team.
Officials of the State Department have decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions from EL Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "recognizing the recent decisions of Taiwan," Heather Nauert, rapporteur of the Department, said in the beginning of the month.
But the penalties were considered only for El Salvador, which was estimated to receive $140 million of US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial assistance and target visa restrictions, would have hardly affected this Central American country with high unemployment and murders.
As the internal meetings progressed, the North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity that was to continue the similar last year's meeting, which represented a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from coming into the United States.
By mid-September, however, the high administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and actually discontinued any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for the mid-October, which is a sign of the importance that the administration is administering the meeting, diplomats said.
And three American envoys were secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new serious messages or punishments from Washington.
The spokesman of the White House on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the debate details described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal debates provided that they remain anonymous.
Their deposition was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next thing that is being prepared could be the report of special investigator Robert Mueller on the possible Trump's obstruction of justice, which is now significant evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller also directed his investigation to discover the possible link between the Trump campaign and the Russian election attack.
If the majority of the Congress changes, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he is preparing to stand in front of the voters again, and perhaps in front of the jury.
There's a lot of these "if" and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall, or those in Europe who are like him, is inevitable.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938 the German soldiers were willing to strike Hitler, just to resist the West and support the Czechoslovaki in München.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter.
The course of history turns around such breakpoints, and the unpleasant march of democracy is accelerating or slowing.
The Americans are facing more of these breakpoints now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires the Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in an independent position since this paper reported last year that he proposed a secret recording of the president and had suggested that he was not similar to the function.
Mr. Rosenstein says the deposition from the Times is incorrect.
"How will we react if the recently ordered FBI investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his candidacy for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite convincing accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote for the Congress at the medium-term elections that will call Mr. Trump on responsibility?
If we fall on those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I believe we're not going to fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia deported to the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country in which I am the ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to burn candles for Saturday on that table with a cucumber cross.
With such heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimist before facing Rapid from Vienna
The Rangers host Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning them over the Austrians, after an impressive rememy in Spain against Villarrel at the beginning of this month, will put them in a good position to qualify from the group of G European Leagues.
The knee injury prevented a collaborative player Graham Dorrans from debiting these seasons until the unsolved match with Vilareal final results 2-2, but he was convinced that Rangers could use this result as a stroke for further.
"It was a valuable point for us because Villareal is a good opponent," 31-year-old player said.
"We went into a game believeing that we could achieve something and went with the point.
Maybe we could have taken them to the end, but in all, the unsolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half-time, and we came back in the second and we were better.
On Thursday, we are again waiting for a great European evening.
We hope we can take three points, but it'll be a hard match because they've had good results in the last game, though, with the support of the audience, we can certainly push out and achieve a positive result.
Last year, it was definitely difficult, starting with everything that happened to my injuries and until the change in the club itself, but now we are pleased with what we have.
The team is in good shape, and the boys really enjoy; we train well.
I hope we can continue now, leave the past season behind us and be successful."
Women can't sleep from anxiety for retirement savings
Despite the fact that the questionnaires had a clear idea how they wanted to take care of them, few talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people covered by Nationwide's research said they talked to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% of them said they were talking about it with their children.
"People want some family to take care of them, but they don't want to start a conversation on that subject," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the life insurance sector in Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and to your children: You cannot prepare your family to give you care if you don’t advance your wishes.
Collaborate with your counselor and your family and consider where and how to give it to you, because such decisions can be a significant factor in determining the price.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you and figure out how to pay those costs.
Your choices for long-term care financing may include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, hybrid life insurance policy with cash value that would help you cover these costs or self-sustainment with your own savings - provided you have enough money.
Fix your legal documents: Stop legal battles in root.
Make an authorization to make decisions on medical assistance so that you can have an authorized person of confidence that will monitor the medical care provided to you and ensure that health workers are treated in accordance with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the conclusion of the financial authority contract.
This means that you choose a person of trust that will make financial decisions on your behalf and take care of paying your accounts if you remain powerless.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parents find themselves in a situation where he needs emergency medical assistance and take him to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Specify details in the written plan to be prepared.
"It's not just finances, it's also about who the doctors are?" Martin asked.
"What are the meds?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Plan it."
A man shot with multiple shots from the air rifle in Ilfracombe
One man was shot with a number of shots from the air rifle while he walked home from the evening exit.
The victim, in his 40s, was located in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
The police described the shooting, which happened about 2:30 to British summertime, as a " random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries aren't dangerous for life, and the police called the witnesses to get in touch.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami affected by the Indonezian city of Palo on Friday, officials said, and the number of dead is expected to grow.
As the interruption of the connections occurred, aid officers could not get any information from the Donggala province, northern from Palua near the epicentre of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Paloo after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donghali, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palo is the capital city of the Sulawesi province, located at the end of the west coast of Sulawesia, with a estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city celebrated his 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit him.
Donggala is a district that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) of the coast in the northwest of Sulawesia.
The district, which was administratively lower than the province, had a estimated population of 299.200 people in 2017.
The fisheries and agriculture are based on the province of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nicle mines are also important in the province, but they are mainly concentrated in Moralia, on the opposite coast of Sulawesia.
Palo and Donggala have been hit by tsunami several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, he killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donghala.
Cunami also hit the west Donggala in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis last years:
2004: The large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26th, caused tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian ocean, more than half in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The quake of 6,8 degrees hit South Java, the most inhabited Indonesian island, launching the tsunami that scattered the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The earthquake of 7,6 degrees hit the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The earthquake of 7,5 degrees hit one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, which caused tsunamis up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A tiny earthquake has affected the region of Pidi Jay in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because he reminded people of the deaths of earthquakes and tsunamis in 2004.
This time there wasn't a cunamic, but more than 100 people died in the ravag of buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 people lost their lives, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists remained temporarily captured.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for family violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and the candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for an assault charge.
Palin, 29, from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of committing domestic violence, disrupting domestic violence and resisting arrest, the State Police Agency of Alaska published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin was detained in Math-Su's detention unit, and his conditional bail of $500, said the KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he stated that he was "no guilty of guilt," the network said.
Palin is faced with three class A violations, which means he's threatened with a prison sentence for a year and a $250,000 penalty.
He was also accused of a breach of class B, punished by a prison penalty for a day and a $2,000 penalty.
This is not the first time against Palin's criminal statements were filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of an attack on his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is right in front of the court of the veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of family violence, disruption of family violence and possession of weapons associated with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her face.
Sarah Palin criticised veterans in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behaviour with PTSP after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake hit by the Indonesian island Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 degrees that caused tsunami destroyed hundreds of homes.
There was an interruption of connections and electricity supply, and the number of dead is expected to increase in the next days.
Epicentrum of earthquake was right next to the central part of Sulawesia, northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Societal networks circulate video recordings that show the moment of strike.
A hundred people gathered together at the beach festival in Palo when the tsunami scattered the coast.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for a suspect for a terrorist attack in New York.
The federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people were killed -- a rare penalty for federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, apparently used the rented truck of the company Home Depot to perform an attack on the bicycle road along the West Side road in the Donny Manhattan, taking down the walkers and bicycles that were found on his way to October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally ” killed eight victims and“ deliberately ” caused severe physical injury, stated in the request for a death penalty, which was filed in the southern district of New York.
For both of these points, death penalties are possible, as indicated in the judicial document.
Several weeks after the attack, the federal major jury accused Saipov on 22 points of charge, which included eight charges for murder and racketing, which federal prosecutors usually use in cases of organised crime, and charges for violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "significant planning and prediction," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov performed it as "nasty, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diega Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Herna Diega Mendoze and Alejandra Damian Pagnucca," said in the request for a sentence.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last had a case in which a death penalty was threatened.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder two drug suppliers, but was finally sentenced to life prison in September 2009.
The latest death penalty in a federal case in New York was executed in 1953 over Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed after they were sentenced to conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 1953.
According to judicial documents, Saipov, born from Uzbekistan, has not shown regrets in days and months after the attack.
He said to the investigators he felt good for what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone, he was inspired to commit an assault, the accusation indicates.
He also asked to highlight the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He said he was not guilty of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were apparently disappointed by the decision of the plaintiff.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty, instead of accepting a lifetime prison without the possibility of exemption for guilt recognition, will only extend the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Sayip's defense has previously asked the plaintiff not to expose the death penalty.
Conservative Ambassador says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize the People's Army" during protests at the conservative conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians had to "sense dissatisfaction" of the euro skeptics, since one of the Members of Therese May suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative Deputy Peter Bone said at the Birmingham miting that the UK would have "exited" so far that Mr. Farage was a secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge in which Mrs. May was faced in trying to unify her deeply divided lines stressed conservatives who proposed a stay in the EU and joined a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister strives to maintain its compromise plan from Chequers despite the attacks and supporters and opponents of Brexit and the EU.
The allies insisted that it continue to try to make a deal with Brussels despite negative reactions, and forced Eurosceptics and labourists to choose between its package and the chaos.
Mr. Bone said to go to Solihull to "free Chequers".
He suggested Mr. Farage should get the title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd have already been out," he said.
The messenger from Wellingborough added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel Chequers. ”
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We haven't fought in world wars to be subjected.
We want to bring our laws into our country."
Mr. Bone dismissed that the public's opinion has changed since the vote of 2016: "The idea that the British have changed their views and that they want to remain completely incorrect."
Brexita Andrea Jenkyns, who also attended the expense, told the journalists: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the wider public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who actually were the ones who went to the streets and chose us.
"Please dismiss the plan from Chequers and start listening."
In a sharp message to Ms. May, she added: “Premiers are able to keep their jobs when they keep their promises. ”
Mr. Farage said to the gathered politicians must be forced to "sense dissatisfaction" if they are about to fail the decision made at the referendum in 2016.
"It is now about trust between us - the people and our political elite," he said.
"They are trying to play Brexit, and we are here today to order them "this won't pass."
In the message of the excited public, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the edge of Brexita, to feel displeased.
"We mobilize the nation's army of this country that has brought us victory in Brexit and will not calm down until we become an independent, self-governmental, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, residues marched through Birmingham before held a two-hour meeting in the center of the city.
Several activists waved the "Torijci versus Brexit" transparency after forming a group this weekend.
The Labourist Lord Adonis laughed at conservatives because of the security problems they had with the party's application to open the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all technology for the Canadian plus plus plan, for the uninterrupted state on borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
Good Brexit is not possible," he added.

Russian Gran Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world's title after the order guarantees his victory over Sebastian Vettel.
Since Valtheri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the order of teams would play a great role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the beginning and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two circles and called on Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Wettel went first to box and left Hamilton behind to get involved in a traffic at the beginning, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered a circle later and went behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after the action wheel from the wheel that Ferrari driver unwillingly forced him to leave a free inside with a risk of delay after a double move in the defense of the third band.
Max Verstappen started from the last line of the grid and was the seventh at the end of the first circle on his 21th birthday.
He then led the majority of the race relying on his tires to reach the rapid ending and overrun Kimie Raikkonen in the fourth place.
He finally arrived in box in the 44th circle, but he failed to speed up the remaining eight circles while Raikkonen took the fourth place.
The day was hard because Valtteri was doing a fantastic job all weekend and he was a gentleman who let me go.
The team has done a really extraordinary job to achieve one or two formation finals," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body speech.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinsten on the miting on Saturday because of her insisting that she didn't let Christine Blasey Ford in public in which a candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual abuse.
Speaking of the miting in Western Virginia, the president did not directly work at Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what happens in the Senate shows that people are wicked, pathetic and liarish.
The only thing that could have happened and the wonderful thing that happens in the past few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and wicked and pathetic and liarful, he said.
When you look at the publications and information that leaked to the public, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you released information to the public?
You remember her answer... did you let the document in public... whatever?
Oh, no.
I didn't let it public."
Well, wait a second.
Did we let... No, we didn't," he added, imitating the Senator.
Ford Feinstein sent a letter in July with details on Ford's instructions against Kavanaugh, and it leaked in early September -- yet Feinsten demanted that information was leaked from her office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't let her story publicly," she said to the Feinstein board, said Hill.
She asked me to keep it secret, and I kept it secret, as she asked."
But her denial did not encounter the approval of the president, who at the soccer's myth on Saturday night commented: Let me tell you, it was really a bad body speech.
Maybe not, but I've never seen a bad speech of the body in my life."
Continuing his defence of candidate for the Supreme Court, whom three women have accused of sexual abuse, the president insisted that democrats use these indications for their own purposes.
They are determined to return the government at any cost.
You see evil, poorness, they don't care who they're going to hurt, whom they have to run to reach the authorities and control," Mediaite transmits the words of the president.

The aircraft whose aircraft crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia announces that one person was run missing after he reported that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the drowned plane.
Air Niugini states in the statement that since Saturday afternoon, they are not able to track the passenger.
The airline states that in collaboration with local authorities, hospitals and investigators work to find this man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more detailed information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local vessels helped save other passengers and crew members after the plane fell into the water trying to land on the island airport Chuuk.
Officials announced Friday that seven faces were transferred to the hospital.
The airline announced that six more passengers were held in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
It's still unexplained what caused the decline and what the exact sequence of events was.
And the airline and the American Navy announced that the plane ended in the lagoon without reaching the flight.
Some witnesses think the plane's been over the road.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to get through the exit in case of danger through the water that slipped them to the stream in the drowning plane.
He said the crew was panicked and shouted, and he suffered head injury.
The American Navy stated that the navy who worked nearby at the dock repair also helped to save a boat to push the passengers to the coast before the plane drowned at a depth of about 30 feet (100 feet).

The American Ministry of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an artist in the field of intelligence analysis.
Before the jury, he said he used the cell phone data to set up a picture of the movement of the accused Quinton Tellis, 29 years old, and the victims of Jessica Chambers, aged 19, at the night of her death.
Rowlett said that the location data received with a few phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers at the night of her death, which was contrary to his earlier claims, reports the Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambersin at the time he was in his own claims with a friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford, testifying on Saturday, said he wasn't in town that day.
On the question of the plaintiff whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanfrod said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed Chambers met about two weeks before her death.
The cell phone data indicated that they knew each other for only one week.
Rowlett is that Tellis erected a certain time after Chambers' death from his phone erased her messages, calls and contact information.
He deleted it from his life," Hale said.
The defense should start with the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expected a jury trial to follow later during the day.

Another black person?
The New York Nanny sues a couple for cancellation after a racist message.
The New York Nanny sues a couple of dismissals on a discriminatory basis after she mistakenly received a message from a mother who complains that she is another black person."
The couple deny that they are racists, assessing the lawsuit as extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed displeasure when, at her arrival of the first working day in 2016, she realized that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman.
NEE OTHER CRNKY," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Ms. Maurice twice.
When she became aware of her gaff, Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that their former nanny, who was a African American, was badly doing her job, and that instead of her, she was expecting a Philippine, transmitted by New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice has received a compensation for one day of work and she's been sent home.
Maurice is now suing a couple asking for compensation for discharge, as well as a $350 per day in six months, to how originally she is hired to live with the family, although without contracts.
I want to show them, see, you can't do such things," she said to Post on Friday, and I know it's discrimination."
The couple replied to racism accusations that Maurice's engagement was reasonable because they were afraid that after she was insulted, they would not be able to trust her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," Post husband Joel Plasco said.
But would you trust your children with someone you have offended, even though it was made by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
By qualifying the lawsuit as an extortion," Plasco said his wife had only received two months of childborne absence and had been in a very difficult situation."
You're going to chase someone like that?
That's not very nice," an investment banker added.
Although the judicial proceedings are still in progress, the public court was quick to condemn the money on social networks, criticizing them for such behavior and thinking.
Paddington's publishers were afraid that the readers would not be the same with the bear speaking, the new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says about the letter: It's hard to put yourself in the position of someone who read it for the first time before the publication.
It's very interesting to know what we now know about Paddington's success."
Saying that her father, who, before a little slippery bear inspired him to write a book for children, worked for BBC as a cameraman, would still be positive if his work was rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the edition of the book was filled with both happiness and sadness after his death last year.
She also added that her father was secretly proud of Padington, whom she described as a very important member of our family."
He was a quiet man, he didn't like to praise," she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if the child made you something and you were proud of him, although it wasn't really your credit.
I think he was looking at the success of Paddington in a way like that.
Although he was the fruit of his imagination , he always attributed all his credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter died, and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
Her daughter was immediately transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nica, where doctors fought for nothing to save her life.
Над regularly called to say it was bad, and they didn't expect to survive," Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then Nad called me to say she'll die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
I did it, too.
I said, Tashi, I love you, darling.
And I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep the heart pumping blood slowly stopped acting and no longer flowing through her blood.
She died just a few moments before that, and everything turned off.
I could only sit and wait, knowing what's going on.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be gathered."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was sad about her daughter's death, boarded the plane along with the other passengers, who never dreamed about what torment she was going through.
No one knew," she said.
I shook my head, and my tears kept flowing down my face.
It's hard to explain, but during the summer, I was overwhelmed by compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Unfortunate women leave messages to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women whose loved suicide want to stop others from taking their own life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humpreyes set cards with motivation messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis's son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression to commit suicide when he was 18 years old.
I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a perspective cook with an infectious laugh.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would light every room."
However, before he died, he left his job because he was in a very dark stage."
Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at that time, was the one who found his brother after committing suicide in 2014.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried that it will leave the consequences."
Mrs. Davis designed these cards so that people knew there was someone you could contact and talk to, even if it was just a friend.
Don't sit down and shut up - talk."
Mrs. Humpreys, a long-year-old friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
He didn't say he was impressed, depressed or anything else," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
On Christmas he was on the bottom, when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eye or anything else."
She says that his death was a huge trauma for them, but that they have to overcome it: it leaves a huge vain in the family.
It's getting us apart.
But we will continue and fight."

With the opening of the FBI investigation, the future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain.
I thought that if we really succeeded in getting something from what he asked -- a limited duration investigation and the volume -- maybe this would have united us somehow," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears the committee to fall apart" because of unconciliable parties' views.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republicans want to investigate the FBI?
Their unwillingness is caused by the choice of a moment.
The elections for the Congress are held for only five weeks, 6 November, and if the Republicans go badly, as expected, their attempts to be elected to the highest court in the country will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush called the Senators on Saturday, lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the feds make their report?
They will vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 democrats are currently sitting.
It's still inconclusive whether Mr. Kavnaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to decide by his voice and confirm his appointment for the Supreme Court.
The number of escapes from North Korea falls under Kim.
The number of escapes from North Korea to South Korea fell since Kim Jong-un arrived seven years ago, South Korean Legislator said.
Calling on the data of the Ministry of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug indicates that 1127 escapes were recorded last year compared to 2011 when this number was 2706.
Mr. Park said that two decisive factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and the bigger tariffs that traffickers are charged by human traffickers.
Pyongyang didn't speak publicly.
The large majority of the northern escapers will eventually be offered by South Korea's citizenship.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with South Korea and is easier to cross it than the strongly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China of escapes considers illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns them back.
Relations between North and South - which are technically still in war - have been remedyed in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang primarily to discuss stopped denuclearisation negotiations.
This followed after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, which has reached a wider consent that they will work on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has blamed US sanctions for the shortcoming of progress.
Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, it does not take into account that we are the first one-sided disarmament," the RI said in its addressing to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh hysterical," saying he was unpleasant to serve in the Supreme Court.
The Leader of the Minority House in Nancy Pelosi called a candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh hysterical," and said he was unpleasant to serve in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't have thought that if she ever acted like a hysterical woman," Pelosi said to her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denyed allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at the time they both were teenagers.
During his introduction exhibition, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and screaming when he talked about his family and his high school age,
He also explicitly condemned democrats in the committee, assessing the indications against him by a grotesk and orchestrated attack on his personality" organized by liberals to be angry that Hilary Clinton lost presidential elections 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he couldn't perform a function in the Supreme Court because it showed his prejudice to the damage of democrats.
I believe he disqualified himself with such statements and the way he went against Clinton's and democrats," she said.
On the question whether he will try to call Kavanaugh back if he is confirmed, and if democrats get most in the Deputy House, Pelosi retreat.
I will say the following -- if he does not tell the truth before the Congress or the FBI, then he is not just like to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court on which he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently a judge of the County's Court of Appeal, District Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she is concerned about the eventual Kavanaugh's judgments against the Law on Accessible Health Protection or in the case of Roe v. Wade, since it is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would alter certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It's not the time for a hysterical, extraordinary person to be put in court and we're expected to say whether this is not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
Just anger, anger gathered for months and years, and it cannot be resolved without paying.
We cry when we are angry," Mrs. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, what do you say?"
She continued: a woman who was somewhere an executive director, and who said she was crying when she was mad, but that she developed a technique that dramatized that when she got mad and started crying, the person with whom she would talk to say you might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she'd just keep going.
And I thought she was great."
The tears are a permitted way to eject anger partly and because they are basically misconcepted.
One of my most clear memories from the previous work, in the office where most men were, is how when I once cried about an incredible anger, one older woman -- the cold boss I always had a little fear -- grabbed her neck and pulled me out to the stairs.
I never let them see me crying," she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they're hitting you."
Patricia Schroeder, a democratic congresswoman from Colorado at that time, worked with Gary Hart at his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extra-marriage affair on the Moneky Business ship and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, she discovered that there was no reason to consider the idea of running herself for the president.
That was not a very thoughtful decision," she said to me in the laughter for 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it Snow and seven dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already out, it was delayed with the collection of funds, and she pledged that she would not enter the race if she didn't collect two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 to her only $250.
Do they think I have a discount?" she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so obsessed with emotions -- thanks to people who supported her, frustration because of the system that made her gathering funds difficult and aiming on voters instead of their representatives, and anger because of the shovinism -- from which she was squeezed in her throat.
You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled that the press reacted to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what would put on my monument?
"She cried."
How the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The first trading war cannadas between the United States and China were deaf, and while the end of the battle is not yet visible, the dissolution between countries can be useful for Beijing, claim experts.
Donald Trump, US President, launched the first warning at the beginning of this year by taxing key Chinese export articles including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest strike occurred this week with new tariffs that hit the items worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds) which are practically taxed by half of all goods coming from China in the United States.
Beijing returned every time by the same measure, and the latest introduction of the tariffs between five and ten percent to the US product worth $60 billion.
China pledged that the United States would respond by the same measure, and the second by the size of the world's economy appears not to stop soon.
Force Washington to withdraw means meeting the requirements, but public worship to the United States would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, Chinese president.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays its next move, US pressures in trade war can long-termly support China by reducing mutual dependence of two economys.
The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for starting a strict economic fall in one of these two countries is actually much more dangerous than the observers believed," said Abigali Grace, a researcher focused on Asia in the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is ready" to return refugees, Minister for Foreign Affairs said.
Syria says she is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in renewal of the country destructed by a war that has lasted over seven years.
In addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem said the conditions in the country are improved.
Today the situation in the field is much stable and safer thanks to the progress achieved fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normal life.
Now there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures focused on their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians left the country since the start of the 2011 war.
Six more million people still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem said that the Syrian regime would be welcome to help rebuild the destructed country.
However, he emphasized that he would not accept the conditional aid or helping countries that helped the rebellion.
Europe took a victory to the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the U.S. team with 16,5 final results to 10.5 in Le Golf National van Paris, France.
The United States has already lost six times in a European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the crown while the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn won 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was tortured during the whole tournament, initiated the ball into the water on the 16th hole of a couple, leaving Francescu Molinarium's match.
Italian golfer Molinari brightened in all rounds and became one of the four players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the tournament started in this format in 1997.
The American Jordan Speith lost 5-4 of Throbjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest ranked European team player.
The best ranked player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 of Ian Poulter from England who might have been the last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder purchases, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best European winner of tournaments all the time with 25.5 points in his career.
I usually don't cry, but I couldn't hold up today.
It was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy, I'm so happy we've won a bunch again.
This is an important team and I'm glad I could be helpful," the emotional Garcia said after the European victory.
She hands over to her country, John Ram, who beats a legendary American golf player Tiger Woods 2 to 1 in individual matches on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this man," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all the four matches in France and now he's keeping a record of his life of 13-21-3 on Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the best players of all time who won 14 largest titles and remains behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team was trying to find a way to the hole all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a top golf during the whole tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, US Captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they were fighting.
This morning was the moment we resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our board of Ryder Cup, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud I was their captain.
You must admit who's better.
We're overgrayed."
