Can anyone answer the phone?
Why isn't Tom happy?
I promise to bring it back.

We were glad to play baseball.
I had coffee.

That's a stupid question.

Although we don't have much money, I want to buy this picture.
Tom's not a conscious man.
Where's your father?
Would you read this to me?
I'm poor.
A man came to see me yesterday.
I had no idea Tom was so naive.
The deer ran on his own.
Can you read French?
I think that's true.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Am I wrong?
Our theme of the week is: _____.
Even smart people are sometimes distracted.
"It's my first flight, I'm nervous," said Hiroshi.
I guess you're hungry.
Let's get some tea at 3:00 p.m.
I've read that book.
You've always been a little weird.
Go practice outside.
I can't fix the refrigerator.
Where's your father?
It's not Tom's book.
Be very careful with that.
I just wish I could speak French a little better.
What would you do if you were 10 years younger?
Yumi will be a teacher.
I heard Tom and Mary talk about it.
Why don't you wear your dress?
How do you view his attitude to us these days?
Is there any other places?
I think you've done enough.
Tom untied his jacket.
Mary put an eye on Tom.
There's something important I need to discuss with you.
Let's leave it another time.
What's the time tomorrow?
I'll clean up.
She gave me a nice doll.
I haven't seen you since we were students.
You know, it's funny.
Thank you very much!
I don't care what you think.
These socks don't be dissolved in the laundry.
I was convicted.
She kept crying.
When the motherhood leaves up, she returned to her old work.
I forgot to lock the closet.
There are more important things for me.

I want to find my deposit.
I'm ready to talk.
How can you not like Tom?
I cried today.
That apple is big.
A scientist made a wonderful speech on human rights.
Your plan is distracted from our policy.
You need to learn more.

Ms. Swan is our English teacher.
Let's get the screwed up.
There's something else I have to do.
To eat sushi.
You're crazy to borrow him money.
I got my room at the hotel and I went to bed right away.
There's something in Tom that I don't like.
I barely understood it.
I'm looking for Tom.
Tom doesn't kiss anyone.
Tom has a map.
I bought it.
I've learned a lot.
I've been working with Tom for three years.
She succeeded in the temptation to buy the jewelry.
None of what Tom does, I don't like.

What did Tom bring with him?
Are we leaving soon?
A man has to fulfill his obligations.
It's never been raining on the island.
I think that'll be the best.
I'm glad to hear it.
The idea we discussed at the class yesterday really attracted my attention.
What would happen if the unbelievable force hit an incredible object?
Let's play.
Why did you decide to do French?
She's out of school for five days.
I wish I continued with the French.
We're graduating tomorrow.
Let's hope so.
He looked back at me and he slipped away.
Go get ready to go to bed.
It's not a weapon.
This coat is subscribed with skin.
I didn't know what I was giving up.
Speaking French is a big party.
Did you actually try?
Hey.
These are Tom's dogs.
I'll give it to you for free.
You better not go.
This spring is late.
If you don't speak English, the probability of taking a good position is much less.
You didn't give me as much as you should.
I might be able to find time to help you.
Tom found it.
Tom wasn't too busy.
It's five days in order.
His clothes always smell bad.
I have a lot of things I have to do.
She gave birth to a boy.
All the brides are beautiful on the day of their wedding.
I hear you're sitting right, it's bad for your back.
He's financially independent of his parents.
What's their purpose?
A great idea came to me.
My dream is to be a teacher.
Merry Christmas!
Tom didn't want me to leave Mary.
Let's ask her something else.
Ken's good at swimming.
There you are.
The robber grabbed the bag from his hand.
Please leave immediately.
Does it smell like sweets?
She was worried she could be late for the train.
Tom and Mary looked at each other and got up.
Come in.
How much is this rain?
Tom locked the door.
I have to go back to work.
Looks like Tom likes his new job.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
They always miss school.

Please close the door when you're out.
You go ahead, I'll reach you later.
Have you ever been to Nara?
I'm really tired.
I only have ten books.
I'm Tom's new secretary.
Tom speaks French perfectly.
Excuse me, how much is that?
It's time to think about your past.
Is it going to recover?
I'm starting to realize it would be impossible.
I waited three days.
He had no idea when to start.
Wet clothes stick on the body.
I'm pretty busy.
Go this road and when you get to the light, scroll to the left.
Tom knows I'm home.
Don't miss this opportunity!
Looks like she has a lot of friends.
Be careful not to fall down.
You're my best friend.
How old is the Eiffel Tower?
We'll solve the question.
The boy is happy with his parents.
If I had a choice, I wouldn't have done this.

He's very angry with you.
Can anyone answer my question?
I don't know where yours is.
Does anyone here know French?
He called me a cab.
You're going to London next week, aren't you?
He also speaks French.
Tom loves horses.
Why did you decide to do French?
That'll need you again.
I'm glad for her company.
Did you pay your phone bill?
We've done the job, so we can go.
Give up your homework!
Nothing interesting happens in this little town.
I know someone who speaks French very well.
Happy birthday!
Oh, now I understand.
You confused him with someone else.
Tom went to get a doctor.
I don't care why.
My cough's getting worse.
Karen's mad at me.
They're not that bad.
There was a little reconstruction in the room.
Tom sent Kate home.
The shirt needs to be smooth.
Tom's not coming in time.
What's he doing today?
He was almost killed.
A glass of water, please.
You scared me.
I have to decide what to do.
I think Tom's doing good.
You don't understand.
I used to my parents to ignore me.
I'm extremely busy.
I don't speak French well.
There was a picture in his letter.
What are you wearing in the suitcase?
Tom died yesterday.
We're going to Edio and school too.
He'd let me help him.
I'd like you to translate this document to French.
I think you were right.
Tom was disappointed that he couldn't get into Harvard.
What's your favorite hot drink?
I'm following music at a university in Boston.
Can I take your coat?
I made a plan on our route.
I've had coffee.
He can drive a car.
I thought we could go to the museum together.
Tom got on the wrong bus.
He has achieved his goal.
Is that a good French?
You deserve the prize.
Can you teach me some French phrases that I might need?
Are these conditions acceptable to you?
Tom's thirty and more.
I paid $30 for that.
Can I borrow your scissors?
A beautiful woman was set up a line in front of me.
Tom and Mary married three years after they met.
I don't want him to give up.
Don't tell anyone anything.
I've seen you play tennis.
Looks like they got caught up with this again.
I'll mean it.
Just close your eyes.
She kept the secret for herself.
That's your hemisphere?
He disappeared inherently.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I think this should be expected.
This book is easy French.
I have to go now.
His wish has finally been fulfilled.
Do you want to become a trusted user?
I'm confused.
Why should we help you?
I don't want to go out tonight.
They're served here with excellent food.
Tom, where are you?
I'll learn French this afternoon.
I had difficulties dealing with this problem.
How long will it take?
They look so much like each other, I don't know what it is.
We got very bad luck.
Please have patience.
Tom speaks French better than Mary.
Can you recommend any other hotels?
My rain stopped coming.
Ken calls me every day.
Our departure was delayed.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
I don't deserve compassion.
Can't you do that?
They're too small.
He gave me what I needed.
How I missed you!
When I grow up, I'll marry Tom.
It's gonna be some kind of start.
How much sugar you put on?
Looks like she has a lot of friends.
It wasn't serious.
Tom whispered to Mary something in his ear.
You can't speak English, can you?
The trees began to cover themselves with leaves.
Look at my fingers.
She speaks English well, but not as much as her brother.
I was really confused.
You didn't eat from the cake I made; but your sister had eaten.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't speak French today.
I think that's yours.
Get up, please.
Who told you my name was Tom?
That's Tom's.
I'll come, too.
Can I open the window?
Let's ask him.
She's on a diet.
Speak loud so everyone can hear you.
It's not our fault.
Will you come back to the beach this afternoon?
She's three years older than me.
I don't want to tell Tom I was in Boston.
I admire the culture and politeness of the Germans.
My friends call me Ken.
Tom couldn't find a job.
I don't want Tom to make things worse.
He was the master of the situation.
I have to read this book.
He married a stewardess.
Everybody's waiting for you.
What he loves is a jelly.
Tom left his family and drowned in illegality.
Let's talk English.
Honestly, honey, I don't care!
When's the last time she's going to the beach?
Don't back up.
Because it was raining, we didn't go to picnic.
I wish Tom could be here with us today.
I'm in the house.
Should I open the window?
Are you sure you don't want to do this?
I need to get to the hospital.
Let me see this.
Our news's been excited.
Are you cold?
I've never stolen anything from Tom.
I need you.
I like to listen to classic music.
I agree with his opinion.
Tom can speak a little French.
I'm sure Tom won't want to work until late.
I was motivated.
I'll get a job.
Do I have the right to accompany you?
I couldn't find what you were looking for.
He rarely goes to church.
They're dealing well with their neighbors.
Didn't Tom say anything about that?
The French isn't that hard to learn at all.
I think you've done enough.
When did you start studying French?
I'll come to you.
No one else suggested help.
Take your coat.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I'll make you happy.
Let's play something.
What are you targeting?
If we just stop trying to be happy, we'd have had a pretty good time.
I forgot his name.
We're not hurrying.
She's rather shy than associate.
I got to the station after the train went.
I've never seen a whale alive.
Do you want to wear my jacket?
I'm not going to ask him.
Be short, please.
That's all Tom has to do.
I think you should be crazy not to go.
These people are very good.
I've waited so long.
You obviously don't want to do this for me.
Fresh fruits are useful for you.
He has a good sense of humor.
He finished the University of Tokyo.
Apparently, I agree that you have to go forward in life with your own efforts.
I've seen them around.
Tom's a beautiful man.
It's terribly expensive.
The endless achievements of Christopher Colom are a threat to Google, who doesn't know how to index the endlessness when someone is looking for Christopher Columbus.
Please answer French.
Because of his embarrassment, he made it.
I've waited too long for this moment.
Do your kids know French?
I bought some Romanian books for the students.
Are you sure you want to leave?
It's perfect.
I can't afford to buy it.
Where are we going?
I think we should find out where Tom is.
I'd like to thank my parents, Tom and Mary.
Are you still happy?
I think you've been here too long.
Did I interrupt something important?
The patient healed a little bit less.
I need to go see Tom.
Tom asked Mary about her family.
Just through my body!
What's the minimum salary in Morocco?
We should've arrived before.
I'm hurting you put me in.
Let's go talk to the other room.
I have to go there.
I heard Tom was getting married.
Tom didn't know the word French when he first arrived in France.
Your flight's cancelled.
I heard you talk to Tom.
Are you sisters?
I thought there was something weird.
Do you live here?
I can't find Tim.
I don't feel my left leg.
What's in the trash?
I have a forming documentation.
I'll come with you.
Please sign here.
My father visited my uncle in the hospital.
That's enough.
The soldiers refused to obey the command.
I heard what happened to Tom.
You must know you're faced with a crisis.
I don't have a ticket.
There are no words in English in Tateba that contain the word "Lego".
Where's your school?
He owns not less than a hundred coins.
I need to find another.
He took a test.
Am I invited?
I don't have proof of that.
I love the turtles.
He doesn't have kids.
The young girl exploded in tears.
Are you John?
Your shoes are untied.
I'm going to bed late at night.
That's what you decided.
I think you're perfect.
The primary school will be required.
In case of fire, use the stairs.
Are you happy, Tom?
I have faith in you.
Mary likes to watch TV.
She's her friend.
We'll be together soon.
She's fucking with you.
Why don't you follow me?
Tom and Mary had a medieval wedding.
We always look forward to Tom's annual visit.
There's no time.
You love the kids, don't you?
I thought you didn't like Tom.
I think we should find out who Tom is planning to give it to.
Unbelievable!
That's all you really can do.
It's time to get a goodbye.
France is bordering with Italy.
I'm sorry the numbers are like life, they're totally logical, but the rules for them cannot be discovered, even if you spend all your time thinking about them.
Her father made her tell him everything.
I worked all the time this week.
It happened today.
I haven't seen Tom for a month.
Can you recommend some other hotels?
All you have to do is weaken the floor.
Have you seen my camera?
I haven't seen Tom for a while.
Show us it.
It's okay with the plan.
Do good to those who hate you.
I'm going to finish this project.
I'm just looking.
The teacher made him stay after school.
Students didn't remember what they read in this book.
As the last precautionary measure, I slipped my flashlight in my backpack.
I've never had such problems before.
His car's two years old.
I don't think Tom knows French.
It won't be so hard to convince Tom.
Tom bought a gift for his son.
If it depended on me, I wouldn't have done this.
I'm not jealous.
I've got problems with my back.
They're gonna make a party for Sam.
Jane's the president's secretary.
The doctor's on the sick boy.
My French knowledge isn't who knows what.
Who owns this car?
You need to be careful.
Look at the back.
I'm not a traitor.
Tom was blaming himself for Mary's death.
The moon is made of cheese.
Their way of life is different from ours.
I don't want to hold you.
This meat is chicken.
I'm older than him for three years.
I think it's okay.
What else is in your pocket?
There was no other place I could go.
The man pushed her off.
A hug of you will make me happy.
I can't believe you still trust Tom.
Please forgive me.
We've been waiting with a weak expectation.
I hear Boston was nice at this time of the year.
What's your nickname?
Neither Tom, nor Mary is good at cooking.
The growing prices feed the alarm of consumers.
I think you'll like Boston.
I heard every word.
Tom was wearing his pijama and climbing into bed.
He's not going to make progress.
I don't like the taste of the tomatoes.
Girls in the province like to cut brosque and slippery flowers from red paper and stick them on doors and windows.
The French Tom's great.
Oil is sold for a pound.
I had so many things to do that I felt depressed.
We praised him for his good work.
The airport was closed because of the fog.
Tom's house was hurt at the flood.
Don't look at me with those sad eyes.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
He doesn't deserve much to discuss.
Tom said you'd come.
Honestly, honey, I don't care!
He himself refused to talk to her.
This painting is beautiful.
He didn't say anything that pissed her off.
That's too little.
I've never seen you here before.
Their coming here was a mistake.
He was injured at the crash.
The question now is "how."
I like to speak French.
There were a wide range of rumours about the defeat.
It's very short.
Stop coming back to your famous days or you'll stay there.
I'm not tired at all.
What's the point of coming in time if everyone else is late?
The wind rained right in my face.
I want everlasting life.
Are you sure you want to hear it?
I think you'll be happy.
That's no problem.
Did you leave the booze?
Looks like there's nobody at home.
I'll have to cancel this request.
So you're just not gonna do anything, are you?
What time is it?
Every time Mary smiles to him, Tom feels happy.
He has full confidence in the traders.
These are the most ugly shoes I've ever seen.
I want to eat some cheese.
I learn French every day.
I've delayed the event.
Your coming here was a mistake.
I have a question for you.
Tom's in absolutely safe place.
I have a meeting with a student.
The panda is a national treasure of China.
If you don't, you're dead.
Tom's impulsive.
They won't bother you anymore.
I won't be able to move Tom on the other side of the bridge.
The patient fell from the blood view.
Leave it to me.
Looks like I'm gonna have to wait a minute.
Oh, come on!

I tried to stop Tom all the way.
Tom will probably be released from the hospital tomorrow.
So the number of heavy and unexpected victims among C++ programmers every year have been caused by errors in the segmentation.
Let's talk French.
You parked in my place.
Marie and Alice are sisters.
I think you were right.
His uncle will take responsibility for him.
What's Tom's address?
Those two shirts are made of the same material.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Did you write your homework?
I have to decide what my priorities are.
What's your father's name?
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
He's mad at you.
Tell Tom he can't go.
Christmas is coming.
I intend to win.
Many of the kids were almost naked.
Tom, I think we should help Mary.
They hired a hamal company to move their things to the new address.
Can you tell me the way to the station?
Tom wasn't inclined.
This pathetic may be useful for you in the journey.
Is your clock faithful?
Give me another chance.
Ken wants a bike.
I like to do gardening.
They've been talking for coffee for more than two hours.
It's an honor to be here.
Is anyone here speaking French?
I think Tom should start seeing other people, except Mary.
Mary just missed the train.
Have you seen Tom?
I made the first step.
Watch where you're going.
He's considered missing.
Tom took off his tie and started unticking his shirt.
Maria is young and beautiful.
What about you?
It's not that simple.
I've never seen you here before.
Tom feels uncomfortable among strangers.
Number to ten.
My Twitter account has been stopped because of spam.
The girls are turned face-to-face to each other.
Please don't.
Start now.
In addition, many groups have formed so that adults can socialize each other and remain active participants in the American life.
How you doing?
What are my other options?
I like cooked eggs.
I realized what was going on.
Don't forget me.
I heard you were looking for me.
I think I'll get to the end, despite her disagreement.
All the news can't be bad.
We need help.
Don't they speak French?
You both look very young.
I was forced to lie.
This is Tom's favorite camera.
Tom stole my wallet.
Tom didn't have much time.
She read all my books herself.
Tom doesn't make mistakes often.
I realize how confusing this is for you.
She despised him.
You're the boss!
Tom can also speak a little French.
I have to admit I was worried.
You don't seem very happy to see me.
Can I open a can?
Training a foreign language is interesting.
Tom's a believer.
This book is yours.
Sounds interesting.
I've prepared a list.
I'm not betting anymore.
It's my brother.
This dress is worth the money.
Tom put his shirt in his shirt.
I don't remember sending the letter.
Why does he look mad?
Tom speaks French.
How hungry are you?
We made them keep quiet.
We arrived a little late.
Even if I lose my job, I'll be able to stand out of my savings.
Which is ours is ours.
I have the same number of books as he has.
I was raining yesterday.
I want to love you forever!
I think you should pick Tom.
I'll give you five bucks.
I think Tom did really good.
I'm a teacher.
I'm talking to you as a friend.
They were terrified of the news.
My nose's stuck.
I'm as strong as you.
Come in.
Tom says he's hungry.
I'm an old friend.
Is that your rain?
Is the washing room possible to be fixed?
People used to live in a village.
I want to be a teacher.
You're crazy to buy such a expensive bike.
I'm so lonely.
I waited a month.
Please explain the rules on football.
That's a really stupid idea.
It was fun last night.
Are you happy?
Is there water on Mars?
It's all right.
Tom won't be in the bank at that time.
I don't think you really want to do this.
Looks like you've made a significant success since the last time I saw you.
The station's in the center of the city.
Don't even make it hard to come.
They're both unpredictable and impatient.
Me too.
I don't like how you're acting.
What are we doing here?
The object is beyond the direction of this investigation.
You sat on my seat.
You're absolutely right.
You're impossible.
Tom said you'd come.
You have to be careful.
I think we'll need Tom's help.
What did you like?
It's gonna be okay.
I almost don't have French books.
Although I'm old, you're still young.
Let's not forget that Tom doesn't understand French.
I'm planning on going there.
Beautiful redhead landed on my bedroom.
I bet you'll be a great father.
Good night!
Someone needs to go for help.
They say you're playing a good gangjo.
You're an ergenic, too?
The prices have fallen lately.
Speaking of travel, have you ever been to Australia?
Tom speaks French relatively well.
I thought it was fun.
I've seen other people do it.
There were 30 witnesses.
He cursed her fate.
I found the key under the removal.
As far as I understand, they'll make a deal with us.
You don't have to make a reason if you don't want to come with us.
I saw her clean up the room.
How are you today?
I'm really interested.
It's your book.
I heard your conversation with Tom.
That's a problem less.
Tom asked Mary to take a teeth paste and a toilet paper from the super paper.
You need to work hard.
This hat's not good for me.
What's the minimum salary in South Africa?
He's on diet because he's a little overweight.
Are we sure we want to appoint Tom?
You take something to drink, you break your elbows to the Swedish table and eat like a pig!
These technical terms are of Greek origin.
That's not Tom's problem.
Keep the rocket tight.
Going home, I saw her again.
Her hair is long.
I put it in your room.
I thought you were serious with Tom.
They won't bother you anymore.
I don't hate myself.
I don't give lessons.
Now it's your turn.
Do you love your mother?
I think you need a break.
Tom's insane.
I think what Tom did was very stupid.
I wish I could speak French as a bearer of the language.
I'd like to find my account.
I heard you talk.
We became friends right away.
Tom spent the weekend at his house on the shore.
Your black's good.
You know everything about me.
Let me think about it, and I'll contact you.
They're interesting people.
Please call me from time to time.
Tom checked his pants' pockets.
Stay on the facts.
I wanted to talk to you about your evaluations.
No one was injured.
It's not literal translation, it's really wrong.
I forgot your number.
How many wheats does this field be born?
I haven't seen you for three years.
Are you sure you want to know?
You can't stop him from drinking.
You're doing very well.
It's your right way, it's your trail.
Will you give me a fire?
He's drinking his coffee clean every time.
I don't have any information about Tom.
She found a job as a machine writer.
Leave it to me.
They lied to you.
I have to go ask Tom.
You should have worked harder.
Her sweater is purple.
Now, after I registered, what am I supposed to do?
Clearly, the Americans can't even solve their own problems, so how do they even imagine that they are able to deal with the problems of the rest of the world?
Speak clearly so everyone can hear you.
I've got a pile.
From now on, I'm going to learn French more seriously.
Do you have any other questions?
It was awfully cold yesterday.
I forgot to give him the message.
I finished American literature at college.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
We were freaking out of anxiety.
I think you'll be happy.
The teenagers left.
I wish I was rich.
I barely started.
If you need anything, just call.
Remember, it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
I've learned a lot of things.
She bought a toy for the kid.
I didn't get the answer from you, but I was wondering if my e-mail ever got to you.
She solved her hair in front of the mirror.
Tom tried to get his keys with his fingers on his feet.
His teaching method is good and bad.
I heard Tom's version of what happened.
All I want is you.
I'm looking for a little suitcase.
He became a witness to the murder.
I'm flying to Boston tomorrow.
He made it clear that there was nothing to do with it.
I love parties.
That's the camera I bought yesterday.
The short poles are no longer fashioned.
I think we'll need more time.
They'll meet in the hotel tomorrow.
Excuse me, how many are these?
Please, repeat it again.
I think so.
Many museums don't work Monday.
They took Tom to the hospital to wash his stomach because he's eating something poisonous.
Don't make me do this.
You sat in my seat.
God don't give it!
Your green's good.
I bet you know French.
To dinner, Tom took Mary to the seas restaurant.
You don't have to pay for the apartment in advance.
Let's play tennis this afternoon.
Whatever you get older, you can always learn.
Do you live in Sasayama?
I wish everything Tom said was a lie.
What's the time tomorrow?
Is there kids?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy listening to you singing.
Can you come tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
We can't hide that fact from her.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
Some say the French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I like to make pictures.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you like French wine?
You have to keep your promises.
Tom was sitting on a danner.
The girls were dancing in the living room.
She is convinced that her son is still alive.
Do you have any French books?
Finally, I stopped in front of the old house and looked at the city again.
You're not gonna see anything without a flashlight.
My dad's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer is correct.
She wrote a letter.
There's a lot of ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit I'm chrapting.
We've been using this insecticide for two years.
Come help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, very bad!
The bus arrived empty.
We need to keep helping Tom.
My mother has a nice handwriting.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to postpone the meeting.
Tom locked his shirt and then put his tie on.
It's very cold today, isn't it?
You won't be able to help us.
She's popular, but not because she's beautiful, but because she's treating everyone well.
Ken plays football every day.
You're welcome again at any time.
I don't want tea, I want coffee.
The lawyers and the car mechanics are the people I trust at least.
Would you like to wait outside?
Can you eat cruel oysters?
What prevented you from working?
Who's the manager?
What are you asking?
I was convicted.
The train went 500 miles an hour.
She gave me this CD.
The director thought about the opportunity to fire Tom, but he decided not to do it.
I have to take it off.
Tom sat by the window.
I don't think you really want to do this.
Most of the students were from the West Coast.
Is it possible that this is love?
I'll eat it here.
Tom has two children.
The police shouldn't take bribes.
I was in the mountain.
That's what I said.
You're lying, aren't you?
The traveling across South Germany will see farms with sun panels wherever they look.
Don't look at the box.
You're running.
I heard the phone ringing.
That's why I can't believe it.
He was angry that no one said anything.
Tom's the only student in our class who can speak French.
I'm sorry I misunderstood your plans.
I'll ask you to translate this report to French.
No one's confused.
Everybody jumped up.
Many traders were robbed during disagreements.
Why do I have to learn French?
She's not tall.
It's true!
We're grateful for your help.
Since we're wearing clothes, we don't know each other.
Let's start.
He visited his uncle yesterday.
Tom's lower than the average growth.
I found the key.
I know that's important.
My aunt, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful blouse.
It's delicious.
You have a lot of friends who worry about you.
I don't have any pencils.
I don't know Tom so well.
Now I'll tell you the truth.
You're drunk.
That's partly true.
He's been living here for the last ten years.
I have socks, but I don't have shoes.
Shit.
She's calling me Kenji.
I have the information you asked for.
In a mysterious way, the sense of humor is related to national characteristics.
Swimming is one of the things Tom likes to do.
He'll be back tomorrow.
Forget about feeding the dog.
I need to look into things.
I'll watch you.
I used to want to be astrophysics.
Tom's bleeding.
This camera is Tom's.
I'm sick.
I really appreciate your help.
I bought a red tie.
You want me to cut it down a little bit?
It's a book.
I have to do everything Tom tells me.
You can do it, come on, I'm with you.
Did Mike stop drinking?
Aren't you glad to see me?
I really wouldn't have done it without you.
I'm not angry with you, I'm just very disappointed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
Did you and my little sister leave at the same time?
The sword was delayed for an unknown time.
His brother's learning a lot.
Ken arrived in Kyoto.
Have you seen Tom?
I wish I was higher.
Do many people visit the museum?
The thieves robbed the museum.
He's crazy about you.
He's coming inside to speak French.
Tom helped Mary wear her coat.
That book about cabuki can be expensive.
I'm sorry.
Is this your book?
I always wanted to learn French.
Will you call Tom, or do you want me to do it?
Don't be afraid of Tom.
He lied on his elbows.
What's the minimum salary in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom he's disgusting.
What's the minimum salary in New Zealand?
I'm smuggling with him for the price.
You can speak French, right?
My dad's smoking rarely.
His vain attempts to deceive her, showed him that he had wrong address; she was the mother of two children.
I lost him.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything you just said.
We're related souls.
The boss is very upset.
That doesn't change anything.
I have a meeting with him at lunch.
The invitation said there'd be popcorns and alcoholic drinks.
Tom looks black.
I hope that helps.
What did you find?
I think we should get out of here.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
He's much older than Ken.
Where are the showers?
Mike runs very fast yesterday.
Do you have a European healthcare card?
None of the balls is yellow.
I know a man you need to meet.
I was rude.
Quala Lumpure is worth a visit.
I couldn't make them understand me.
Do you speak French, too?
I've recently started learning French, so I'm not very good.
These gloves belong to Tom.
Where's the entrance?
Tom's trying to get Mary's answer.
A boy, not more than five years old, asked Tom how to get to the mail.
Tom still lives with his parents.
Sometimes we meet them.
I think Tom's sleeping.
Are these explosives?
If you don't want to be alone, I can make you company.
Anne has no sisters.
Tom's got small hands.
He arrived two days earlier.
Was it a good trip?
He made me a suit.
Men make houses, women - homes.
Where's the bathroom?
They usually go home before us.
I don't know what to say.
I'm your brother.
I won't be able to get Tom on the bridge.
If I were you, I'd be asking for this job.
The patient was released from the hospital.
My Internet connection is slow.
We need to keep working.
Hurry up, we'll be late.
How long do you have to wait?
I'm smarter than you.
I was fascinated by her opera singing.
You'll find him.
Don't fall in love with me.
Who's with Tom now?
His concert was very good.
There's another number of tourists here.
The door clicked and closed.
I'm hungry!
It's easy to talk to Tom.
The brothers of the twins are completely alike.
Don't hang out with Tom.
I didn't understand the smile.
I'm hunting you know it.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want to come with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Would you say that again, if you like?
How much money do you have?
Oh, I was sick.
I have a lot of bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Given how long I've been learning French, I should be able to speak better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit, I'm a little nervous.
You want to buy a shirt?
I think you have the right not to let Tom go.
Tom accepted the invitation to visit Mary's feast.
You're not the only one there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends happy.
I'm mad at myself.
It's done manually by Tom.
You won't believe what things people throw away.
I stopped smoking for a year.
He doesn't wear much bags when you're traveling.
I got Tom's picture here.
I didn't tell you everything.
They're working both.
Tom's not welcome here.
You blame her for lying to him.
There's no point in fooling yourself, you know, she's playing games with you.
George's very enthusiastic about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He must be given advantage to the others.
I've moved you.
Take it with you.
Just wait a minute.
I swim once a week.
I was waiting for an hour and a half.
He made fun of me publicly.
The circle's burned.
Tom worked very hard.
How much money do you need?
Oh, I was sick.
We're in position.
Reduce it.
How about we have dinner together?
I think you lied to me.
That's incredible.
Where's the bus terminal?
If it wasn't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
That's the picture I made with Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I've never spoken French to Tom.
We all thought Tom could speak French.
Tom came back inside.
Who's Tom talking to?
I'd like to learn more about the museums.
This shirt needs to be washed.
You won't believe it.
I'm looking for my house.
I don't feel well.
Why early?
He decided to go abroad.
I don't blame you.
I'm a nightbird.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, don't you?
Do whatever you want, but I'll stop him if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I need to trust Tom.
I'm thinking about learning to swim through the vacation.
Where's the beach?
Are the Jayants playing tonight?
I feel like he won't let me freak out so easily.
It'll be 5:30 in a minute.
School starts at eight and a half.
Tom's bathing.
The beach is not far from here.
Ken jumped through the wall.
The top of the mountain is covered with snow.
A hug of you will make me happy.
When are you going?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
Right next to the beach, there's a really good restaurant that I think you'll like.
What made you think that?
I'm coming.
He missed the last train.
I looked at the picture.
You had no choice but to wait for her.
I totally erased you from my memory.
I haven't said no yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
You mean French?
I've never seen you so nervous.
What's the minimum salary in Lithuania?
Here's the hospital I was born in.
Whoever sows the winds, he'll swallow the storms.
According to the last figure, the total population of the country is less than 7 million people.
Temporary measures will not have any effect on drug addiction.
I don't know where I left the keys.
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Convicted to death.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, can he?
I don't have anything.
At least once think with your head.
I thought you might be hungry.
This is the beginning of the new era.
I have to put my shoes on.
I'm thinking about it.
Don't you have anything else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you pick up?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We had to obey their request.
Choose the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so go to bed early.
That was really stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I don't have anything to suggest.
I'm talking to my servants in French.
This is my sister's picture.
Tom's been dealing with people like Mary.
I've tried them all.
He gave her one advice.
The room was so smoked that I could breathe hard.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He definitely loves you.
I lost my wife last year.
Looks like she doesn't feel good.
Did Spot go too?
I promise to bring it back.
I have relatives in Boston.
Get out of here!
Tom's wearing a shifter.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I need to go talk to Tom.
How about we study together in the library?
I have a job to do.
The job proposal is still in force.
Your shirt is missing one button.
I have to get out for a while.
Your green's good.
Squeeze your fingers.
I'd like to buy the car you sell, but I don't have enough money right now.
Can I see this one?
My uncle gave me this clock.
Real friendship is forever.
Tom's used to working on the open.
Tom pressed the trigger.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
You're kidding!
Let's go back.
I'm on the bus.
Tom learns French every day.
In this store, they are dealing with kitchen aids.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom didn't answer right away.
You're expected to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works in that baker is cute.
Please, get me another cup of coffee.
Alice may come.
How do you do that?
I had a good time.
I'll stay until the next day.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not my fault.
Did any of your team speak French?
Looks like it's gonna start raining.
I've never seen one like this before.
Come as soon as you can.
I've never climbed up to the top of Fuji.
You don't play golf, do you?
Tom doesn't work anymore.
It's probably nothing important.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom jumped.
What's the minimum salary in France?
I forgot her name.
This political problem has caused exhausted debates.
Eat on a living frog every morning, and all the rest of the day, nothing worse will happen to you.
Tom won't be happy to see you.
Unemployment is growing.
Last night, I couldn't wake up.
Russia loses 20 million people during World War II.
I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
Nancy smiles.
If you're going to France, you need to refresh your French.
I understand what you're saying.
I never trusted Tom.
I'm learning French at school.
That's what he said.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I won't be able to tell you what happened.
I think you should give up.
Please have patience.
Your joke's far too far.
I had a very good day.
Christopher Columbus was drinking unfilted seawater.
I want to be a French teacher.
I'm glad I don't need that.
They're all hungry.
The Japanese have black eyes.
Tom's a professional baseballist.
Tom wished he was still unloved.
I have three children.
Let me sleep for ten more minutes.
My uncle gave me the clock.
All horses are animals, but not all animals are horses.
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
Last week, I ate pizza every day.
I promise to bring it back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have any gum?
I guess you're wrong.
His daughter has become a beautiful wife.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom's on his desk, he says something.
Do you want some coffee?
I'll call you for Tom.
I opened my check account.
He was here at that time.
I put my shoes on right now.
He felt uncomfortable in his fatherâ€™s presence.
Your shoes are untied.
Tom shouldn't be here.
He took off his coat.
I can swim in the river.
Are you working French every day?
Don't make that noise, please.
You're pretty good in French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one thought his words were important.
That's a strange problem.
I don't understand that.
Where do you live?
I didn't know what to do.
It's time for lunch.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom got a six.
I did it for you.
I've seen you somewhere.
They'll play basketball after school.
Those clothes are good for you.
I couldn't say no.
That's surprising.
I heard someone come in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did the bus go to the museum?
I need to discuss something personal with you.
He was transported to the helicopter hospital.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
Your neck's shirt.
Are you coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played with Tony yesterday.
Jill's engaged with Jack.
I wish you luck.
He was alone at home.
In the esperanto, the essential ends with "o". A multiplied number is formed by adding "j".
Tom wants to be a doctor when he grows up.
Don't I get a hug?
I'm older than any other student of my class.
I'm buying tapes.
We'll need Tom's help.
How high is your brother?
Come to our guests.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Jane's got serious trouble.
It was a perfect day.
I haven't taken a shower for three days.
The triangles don't have four corners.
Are you sure you want to know?
I accept your offer.
What's the minimum salary in Romania?
Brian left the door open.
Tom, wake up.
How are you going to come home?
I wash my clothes.
I've heard the French is a tough language.
I haven't completely fed.
Soon you'll stop thinking about her.
Let me see.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom's working for a big company.
Say hello to your friends.
Let's ask.
Get upstairs and go to bed.
Come on, touch it.
That's my job.
Don't touch the ball on the door.
How many years have you been studying French?
Carol's back to her hotel.
Do you like that color?
Please be short.
I haven't seen him yet.
The mountain is covered with snow.
Let's get out of here.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
He came out of the train.
Mary's dating two at the same time.
It's not even the same as Tom.
Give it to me.
Did you do everything you wanted?
You'll have to wait and see.
I was waken at five.
I was afraid I might have been late.
Tom says he can connect to the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Don't talk to me now.
What do you want to tell me?
I'm looking for something not that expensive.
Tom is much easier to speak English than French.
I think you'll be surprised.
Next time I'll make more effort.
I've done my job already.
He's a hero.
I don't have any requirements.
Her charm is a mixture of joy and kindness.
I should have listened to you.
I've got Castene hair.
I'll meet you at the park.
I've never won before.
It's a little left.
I like this color.
My grandmother was surged in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I've seen you and Tom.
I don't think it's true.
I got three cameras.
Get him to call Tom.
We all regret Tom.
I hope I have a chance to return your favor.
Tom crossed the drawer to see if there was any chemical that could use.
This requires careful discussion.
Tom won't believe it.
I need to learn the truth.
I think you should meet Tom.
We ran after the cat.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I wish I was young.
Be more accurate.
The French Tom's really pretty good.
Isn't the time great?
I don't feel embarrassed.
I don't want to belong to the elite at all.
I've seen you on TV.
You need to learn hard.
I'll be back soon.
Ask Tom yourself.
Tom explained the details.
Don't let Tom pass.
He played football with an empty can.
I think you'll really like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm a vacation this week.
My French teacher is at my age.
You better put your sweater under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process achieves good results.
That's what his ignorance is of course.
You're absolutely right.
Everyone knows his name.
My French is not good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are they criminals?
Can you get six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We'll make him a good-bye party.
What club are you member of?
Acushi could have been sick.
Tom didn't get on the bus.
Some books are worth rereading again and again.
We're working together now.
Go back to your place.
He finished Cambridge with a distinction.
I have to get her back tonight.
I have to start preparing.
Is Tom learning French at school?
What are the shoes going on?
We definitely worked hard.
I'll put my journey to Scotland while it warms.
He started excusing himself.
How old are you?
It's all right.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't force me to do this.
How big are your kids?
I'll stay until tomorrow.
Please call the doctor!
I think Tom can share your feelings.
I gave up.
You and half don't know.
That's the picture I made with Tom's house.
She gave him something to eat.
I'm starving!
I'll help you get better in this.
My dad's going to run every morning.
I saw Tom walk on the beach.
My brother became an engineer.
How much money do you want?
Don't get up too fast.
She handed down all her dolls.
I didn't say anything.
What are you gonna do?
I really appreciate it.
I knew you'd be busy.
Go away.
It's a big town.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Kim's dressed very attractive.
Don't ask me for money.
Tom hates school.
There's no problem creating a web site, just be careful not to violate someone's copyright.
Tom protected his wife.
She has a beautiful handwriting.
The fingers on the hand are five: thumb, indicator, middle finger, nameless and poor.
The folio is made of polyethylene.
I've decided the problem with lightness.
Did anyone notice that?
She's a little shy.
Are you sure you don't want me to call Tom?
You're young, though, I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
How much taxi is going out of there?
You both look very young.
You're absolutely right.
Is that yours, Tom?
I don't have many English books.
We have time until tomorrow morning.
I like your shirt.
The enthusiastic began his worthy respect for the beginning.
I've seen you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
At first, the local cowboys laughed at him.
Looks like he's in a hole.
I think you should come see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
Be more accurate.
I'm a vacation this week.
You're laundering your socks.
I promise not to do that again.
I just gave blood.
He doesn't know French or German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
I don't doubt his honesty.
Please open the package.
I'm buying.
I have no idea who he is.
Would you please tell me your name?
Such mistakes are inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Is he watching the game?
This is your home.
The losses were hard for both sides.
I'll follow your instructions.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something hot for a drink.
Tom tried to convince Mary that it was time for her to leave.
She's chewing every morning.
Don't forget the celebration tonight.
Do you prefer to speak French?
Wow, that's cool.
Don't make me cute eyes.
I don't have any money.
Millie eats bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't do this without you.
Tom's not used to living in town.
Take a look at Tom.
Jane went out to shopping.
This cake is nice.
I told Tom why I couldn't go.
The long poles are now demode.
He's doing very well with kids.
Come in, please.
We really had fun.
Tom hates this.
It's true she's dead.
Don't get used to it.
Finally, it stopped raining, and time warmed.
She didn't do very light tips of what she wanted for Christmas.
Students didn't remember what they read in this book.
I learn French every day.
I heard every word.
Where did you take off your socks?
Let's go to the movies.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some poisons used correctly are useful.
What are we gonna eat?
Keep it secret.
You make me feel so guilty.
I'm mad at you.
Let's do it.
She gave me permission to use her vocabulary.
He's three years older than she is.
Don't hope so much.
What's the price of this rain?
Mom, would you give me the toilet paper?
How'd it go?
I think you'll find him.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you've changed the whole room.
I'd like to buy the car you sell, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom showed Mary a few effective ways to learn French.
I'm not good at sports.
The judge condemned him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to succeed.
I found that he's a genius of chemistry.
It can't be like you're walking over and over, starting to harass people's address.
I had an appointment at 2:30, but I got in a bargain, and I couldn't get there in time.
They went to the sea museum.
Tom's making a lot of effort to improve his French.
It's been lost for a long time.
They didn't talk.
I didn't call you "bullshit."
I'm talking French today.
Can you tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not that bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it in.
We're all connected.
One word of support, when you fail, costs more than an hour of praise when you succeeded.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
It was done.
His shirt was scratched with sauce.
Tom found Mary's story interesting.
Mary Tom won't get any help.
You won't be protected anywhere.
She was wearing a skin coat.
I promise not to do it again.
I made Anne a doll.
What have you finished, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
The story is very interesting to me.
I've read that book.
That was a good year for you.
He was cleaned up.
I can't do this.
I'm a French teacher.
I want to buy Tom's gift.
One thing's sure, no one can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly man.
I was convicted.
Tom was told recently he had cancer.
Tom's home with a bus.
For me, a meeting this afternoon is a better option.
What do you have to do?
Tom's been studying French three hours last night.
Get your hand up.
What's that?
It was too easy.
I travel often.
Here's the hospital I was born in.
I never liked biology.
I owe you so much for your kindness.
Let's divide the prize fifty to fifty.
Squeeze my hand.
I'd like to buy the car you sell, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think you'd better get down.
I haven't seen Tom since his birthday.
I need to know.
Do you like to travel?
Your plan failed.
Tom made a big party at his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced to leave school.
I just finished breakfast.
I have to go help Tom.
It happened once.
How long will you have to wait?
Tom's the guy who told me when the meeting will be.
I appreciate your cooperation.
The soldiers started coming home.
I have a problem, I need your help.
Let's get on the bus.
Are you coming or not?
Tom didn't want Mary to play with his kids.
I forgot to tell him.
Nancy looks so tired.
I really appreciate the proposal.
Don't talk about people behind their back.
She's reached a mature age.
Come with me for a walk.
I'd love to watch the movie.
Whoever's well ready, don't worry.
I was fun watching TV yesterday.
Do you have a hobby, Tom?
These are the trees on whose leaves live peanut bugs.
Who speaks French better, Tom or Mary?
I have news for Tom.
Are you sure Tom's behind all this?
Please don't let that happen again.
The sticks hurt me.
I tried everything I know.
Why are people afraid of her?
He's been fighting hepatitis for six months, but it looks like he's recently started to recover.
The universe is a mystery.
I'm back in Boston.
Where's your father?
What's the bill?
A man came to see me yesterday.
I'll be in my lab.
Can you tell me your room number?
I suspect Tom has no idea what Mary did.
Patients often die just because they are stuck against their diseases.
I wouldn't think the tofuto was so delicious.
Are you jealous?
Who plans this trip?
What time is it?
Then what does it mean?
I haven't passed my lightback yet.
He's asking you to help him.
I've only been to Boston once.
I don't know where yours is.
He could change his mind.
Do you feel guilty?
Do you think?
He learned to swim.
Can't you really swim?
New York is a big city.
I'm too low.
I was hoping I could get back to the beach next weekend.
I'm screwed out of the veins.
I can't do it alone.
I hope you're right.
If you tell her about this, then she'll tell her best friends, then her best friends will tell their best friends and eventually everyone will understand.
She was cold.
Tom speaks with French accent.
I've never seen long.
Ken can swim, right?
Tom and Mary went to the lunapark.
I thought it was best not to say anything about it.
I'm not a student.
Are you looking carefully?
A few minutes later, the phone ringed.
She wasn't even there.
Jane's from Australia.
Close the door, if you like.
Tom finally left.
Tom assumed Mary wouldn't come to the party.
That's the sweetest baby I've ever seen.
I'm not mean.
There's a nice food in this restaurant.
I'm not doing that.
Are they confused?
You parked in my place.
I don't know where he is.
Unemployment creates it.
I have to take my son at 2:30.
Sugar is cute.
Where are you going?
That's a great poem.
The prices have fallen lately.
Tom's an interesting man.
Are you trying to take me off?
If you're late with the control transmission, it won't be accepted.
I'm a little busy right now.
Are you worried?
Calm down.
Tom wants more money.
Is that your family?
It was a terrible day.
I don't live with Tom.
Do you still love Tom?
I won't be able to move Tom on the other side of the bridge.
Where do we go?
You can't be angry with me about that.
I grabbed the cat for my neck.
Looks like he'll win.
I think you need a vacation.
It can't be what it looks like.
I think I found something better.
There were a lot of frogs in that pond once.
I understand it perfectly.
It depends on the context.
Did something change?
I'm not that brave.
He prefers French than German.
You can read French, right?
Fred's often late for an hour.
Don't cry, you're not gonna fix anything.
Who's thirsty?
The girl's eating bread.
I love partyes.
I don't know what it is.
I can't buy you this dress.
I heard him go down the stairs.
A friend's coming to visit tomorrow.
I hope that's what's going to happen.
Ms. Satow may have sent the flowers.
Take us to the center.
The sea was calm.
She's an atheist.
Tom was impatient and nervous.
I need a new USB cable.
You're driving too fast.
Can I trust you?
It's hard to please Tom.
How long are you gonna be mad at me?
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Why did you run?
Who's your favorite bird?
You can study here.
Let me help you.
You'll like it!
I'm afraid I've affected you.
There's nothing to worry about.
This is my house.
He's deprived of experience.
I didn't know you were cooking.
Tom didn't pay any attention to Mary.
Put these shoes on, please.
I heard it was nice.
Tom doesn't like that color.
I feel safer here.
I want to be young again.
Tom refused to go.
He's with blue hair.
I don't know when he'll come.
Mary told John the secret.
In the next semester, I'll learn French.
Tom won't speak today.
See you tonight!
I'm out of money.
I got him a cup of coffee.
Where's your babysitter?
Nothing happens like you thought.
Why don't you want to wear a tie?
Children need to obey their parents.
Is there any mistakes in this exercise?
Can you come in Sunday night?
I remember we've met before.
I'm looking at him as my best friend.
No one answered the phone.
I've seen you somewhere before.
You're learning Esperanto.
The new bike cost me 50,000 yen.
I think you're crazy.
Keep it until later.
They're the best friends.
You're a problem.
You're so surface.
I have great news.
Looks like it's raining, doesn't it?
That's a long story.
We solved the problem.
Does Tom know where Mary was born?
He decided to go there.
I hate her, but I don't know why.
Tom looks objective.
The tunnel's gone down because of the earthquake of the last day.
I need to talk to you about Tom.
Mary spoke Japanese slowly.
What are you doing all this time?
My uncle never writes letters.
Close the goddamn door!
We used to make fun of him about that.
John arrived a week ago.
He refused the offer, too.
Oh, I forgot my keys.
Excuse me, I have a request.
The shaveman is a man who shaves the beards and shaves the hair of men.
Do you like Mozart's music?
That's my problem.
Is that yours, Tom?
We're not all that stupid.
Any problem can be solved if you are stubborn and patient.
Tom started learning French three years ago.
You have a phone.
How old are you?
Tom's working there.
I'm not her type.
Are you free tomorrow night?
He lives somewhere around.
Tom loved singing, but no one wanted to hear him sing.
Tom didn't lie down on the ground.
I think we can handle it better.
I think you should think about it.
I'm not a naughty man.
I'm the most ordinary office worker.
He was in France.
Don't let that bother you.
Have you ever seen the kengur?
Tom can't figure out how to open the box.
I think Tom's serious.
I'll tell them I'm not coming in time.
He's frequently walking to school.
The socks smell.
When are you getting married?
It's a fazan.
He came down from the train.
You're hot.
How many episodes of Van Peace have you seen?
Her name is known to everyone.
I think you're perfect.
Is that a big difference?
You can make pictures outside the museum, but not inside.
Let me go.
You're sweet and sweet.
My sister lives in Yokohama.
I think you should make a deal.
It wasn't my intention.
I have to get out of here for a while.
She loves the color of her shirt.
Hey, man, I beg you so much, scratch a little insecticide behind the refrigerator.
She denyed me that I didn't answer the letter.
I'm tired.
Your English is getting better.
It's your turn.
Put another pair of socks in your trunk.
Soon after that it started to rain.
I have to get back to Boston tomorrow.
They don't want permissions.
Tom sent Mary a message written in French.
I'm glad you're happy.
When the conversation is over, he says goodbye and wishes me a good evening.
Let me check.
You've done a good job so far.
I made dinner last night.
Tom can't stand up.
It's hard for me to concentrate today.
Thank you very much for your cooperation.
Who told you my name was Tom?
Aren't you impressed?
Tom's not here today.
I have to buy one of these.
She helped him herself.
I have a job for Tom.
Where did you throw them out?
As usual, the physics teacher is late for hours.
Let's figure out what's right and what's wrong.
I forgot to turn off the lamps.
Can I take a picture of you?
"Can I park here?" "No, you can't."
I've seen you somewhere.
You've been sitting in my place.
I've already tried this way.
You don't speak French, do you?
I'm ready to order.
Students shouldn't use this bathroom.
You got into the winning series.
I want a drink.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She doesn't have time for anything but to take care of the baby.
It's nice to meet you, too.
The movie wasn't as interesting as the book.
Let's go!
I don't want to be worried.
I don't think Tom's number is in the point.
Can you do it yourself?
Thank you very much for the detailed explanation.
I'm the only one who knows them.
She's sticking to her after dinner.
These containers are closed hermetically.
He's the best player in our team.
I've seen you before.
There's none.
I want more information.
Are you wearing a gun?
He says he avoided the danger by pretending to be dead.
Are you home?
Can you tell me what to do?
Be careful with her.
Don't shoot, I'm out.
Isn't that surprising?
He's friends with everyone you've met.
You need to learn harder.
I'm sorry, but I don't believe it.
I just don't understand that.
He broke into a house.
I arrived later than the usual.
We're not disappointed.
She was frightened.
I was your mother's first friend.
The quarrel ruined our unity.
How much money can I take with me?
Tom's good with the French.
I'm going to go through stories like that.
I'm used to it.
Welcome to Japan.
She's just shopping.
Remember, it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
"Who are these socks?" "My sister."
I think you should call Tom.
She was a tall, sharp blonde.
I gave Mary a book.
His surveillance said not to eat between the main meal classes.
Is there any survivors?
The shelter sticks at her feet.
We chose Jack as president.
This is my friend Tom.
They've been screwed up with each other.
Tom's a French teacher.
We're going down to the next station.
Tom asked Mary to meet him at his office tomorrow.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom's with a light skin.
Thank you, that's all.
The engine doesn't want to burn.
I'm early.
Let's go to closed.
Jesse immediately accepted the invitation.
Jack Nicholson grew up in New Jersey.
Is there a free will?
I'll be present.
I think that's Tom's bike.
I need to go see Tom.
It's been a long time since the last so nice surprise for me.
Let's play Canadian.
I think we have enough time.
Yunko is a nice girl.
Let's have lunch.
I've waited so long for him.
Aren't they cute?
I can't change these plans.
I'll be home soon.
He was traveling at work.
I had a little temperature this morning.
The medication works.
I can't go anymore.
Tom has a very big nose.
Is that the right direction for the museum?
School starts at eight and a half.
It happened twice.
Deep breathing is healthy.
When was the last time you went to the beach?
We freaked out of worrying about you.
He can't read.
You're doing a good job.
The debate won't solve anything.
Maybe I'm wrong.
I hope that makes it easier to understand the meaning and memory of the newly learned words.
I think they know us.
I don't intend to hurt you.
Can you introduce me to a doctor who speaks French?
Are you sleeping?
Our team was with red flanels.
How about a walk on the beach?
These dogs are big.
Everybody say "sir."
Tom won't pay.
The rain stopped me out.
When I was your age, we had to walk upstairs to school, both directions.
He'll be busy tomorrow.
I have no idea what I'm doing here.
Nothing more, thanks.
I've already tried.
I think you're working too hard.
He was drinking a lot yesterday.
That won't help you.
Just do what Tom says.
The prisoners were released.
Be careful with that.
I can't see anything.
The meeting was delayed.
You don't have to waste yourself.
It was a great day.
How old was he?
It's off!
Tom doesn't see you.
I wrote to my teacher in French.
You're not coming?
I'll stay by lunch.
I forgot his name.
I think you'll be happy.
Let's not talk about it anymore.
Then what's the problem?
It wasn't that hard.
It's business.
Please lock the safe.
She interrupted me.
They're both alive.
I'm too low.
Tom went abroad to learn French.
Tom gave Mary's card.
I think you'd better stay with Tom.
Tom didn't do it.
That's the job I chose.
I think our gasoline's over.
Let me tell you something about myself.
We pushed the car.
What's the minimum salary in Germany?
We have something for you.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I don't eat pigs.
Your coming here was a mistake.
The newspaper published the profile of his new editor.
It's been a failure from the beginning.
Why don't we get him a bottle of wine?
Five days after she finished, my daughter flew from Osaka airport to Germany.
The boy laughed at the girl.
Please don't touch it.
I've seen Tom around here.
I need to get in touch with Tom.
I haven't been bathing for three days.
Just close your eyes.
Let's get friends.
I've just created a new text processing program with which words can be pronounced backwards.
We certainly need Tom's help.
Please give me a pillow and a blanket.
Your jacket and your tie don't go.
I'd love to be young like you.
I was surprised how well Tom speaks French.
Tom lives a little below the same street that Mary lives.
The new teacher is in the classroom.
Hurry up, or you'll miss the bus.
I think I told you never to go there alone.

This is where my sister was taken.
You'll regret it.
In her school, no one is a better swimmer than she is.
Is there a big house?
He's drinking too much beer.
She's very shy and she's worried when she's somewhere at the party.
I think Tom's a good name.
As long as I'm alive, you won't be deprived of anything.
I heard what happened.
I like your shirt.
I'm telling you, she looks like her mother.
You need to apologize.
How do you know that?
Tom can object.
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I think you'd better give up.
Parents often make sacrifices to give good education to their children.
Where are you from?
Looks like your dog's thirsty.
You're going to London next week, aren't you?
I have plans for tonight.
I wouldn't bet that.
You don't look too surprised.
Apparently it worked.
I need to learn Tom of this.
That's a good sign.
Tom jumped through the window.
Let me tell you, it's my fault.
Let me call you.
I gave them some clothes and some food.
You're wearing your socks upside down.
I'll get up early tomorrow.
You like the French, don't you?
She almost got over her car.
Tom's not like them.
I left my credit card home.
It's too hot.
You're bleeding.
I just want to be with you.
I want to learn French.
She's eating apples.
I think you should check under the couch.
My car was stolen last night.
Tom wasn't at the party.
Are you satisfied?
Why don't you take a rain in case?
I really want it.
Maybe I'm wrong.
Are you done with breakfast?
It wasn't my fault.
Read it again.
He arrived earlier than usual.
I talked to him about this on the phone.
I think you're very talented.
The airlines were moving almost empty.
They need more research.
It's your responsibility.
Come to our guests.
I have to push my bike because one of the tires has fallen down.
This shirt is a standard size.
Don't make fun of me.
I put my hand on her shoulder.
From the store to the house, I was wearing the heavy baggage and crying out my ho-o-hop.
What languages do they speak in America?
That's incredible.
When she heard the news, she fell down.

This basic school has a strong football team.
How can Tom not like you?

That's right!
That's probably the key Tom's looking for.
I had to walk there because my car crashed.
It's still happening.

You always sing.
I forgot it in the garage.
I owe him 1,000 yen.
How can I find you?
Nick owes me ten dollars.
I don't want to work under these conditions.
Don't punish Tom for that.
I've never seen you so scared.
Tom marked three points.
Do you like walking on the beach?
When are you going to leave?
Is anyone with you?
Tom couldn't believe what's going on.
Did you have fun last night?
Right, he's wrong.
They're already here.
He's sitting in the kitchen.
I'm bringing her back.
When does he close the art museum?
I was busy this week.
You're coming from Sweden.
I thought we were gonna breakfast together.
Swallow it.

What do you want?

He raised his hands.
One coffee, please.
I haven't heard from Jane since she moved to Tokyo.
It was like a wave.
I think you'll be impressed.
He thanks me for coming.
He's lower than Tom.
Can you drive?
I can't speak English, not speak Spanish.
Someone must have stolen your watch.
Tom grew up speaking French and English.
What are you doing now?
The museum deserves to be visited.
Tom will be away for a week.
I'm looking for a gift for my father.
The problem doesn't deserve to be discussed.
It was pretty cold.
"For here or for home?" "That's for, thank you."
Bob's home late.
The elevators don't work.
You want the courage to do that.
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
I took her to town.
Anyway, you'll never know.
Believe it or not, bress and badems are one family.
Do you want to hear something funny?
There aren't enough chairs in the conference room.
I have no idea.
Tom wasn't perfect.
When I was a college student, I never slept the night before the exam.
I really want this.
I learned a lot of Spanish words today, and now I know how to say "booze", "brade" and "clear".
In the winter, I'm sleeping with two turgans.
Let's split it.
I'm going to go around.
You can go.
I've never seen these pictures before.
Tom's hard to deal with in such situations.
She didn't like him.
He has a strong body.
Are you scared?
Everyone knew Tom could speak French well.
Tomorrow's Sunday.
Tom doesn't see without his glasses.

Did he ride with an express train recently?
Make sure you're not late.
Are you involved?
I heard Tom was hurt.
How many episodes of One Piece have you seen?
I heard they caught Tom's killer.
I really had a great time.
It's time to go.
Only when I think about the incident, I'm screwed up.
I've seen them before.
Why is Tom angry?
He speaks Japanese well.
The director thinks if he can fire Tom.
I'll be with Tom.
"How many candles squeezed on your birthday?" "Ffty-six."
Yellow socks are tied on the hand.
You're late for three days.
Read it again.
The word expresses my feelings.
Tom has bad news.
Where did Tom say we should go?
Go wake up Tom.
I just finished doing my homework in French.
I'm looking for my hemisphere.
Let's have dinner.
I'll visit him tomorrow.
This guy was an asshole.
Tom likes to wear white socks with his sandals.
It's in a shape with my principles.
I don't know why Tom is so angry.
What are the facts?
I wish I could scream.
I'm the one who saved Tom.
I've seen you somewhere.
She translated the letter from Japanese to French.
I'm fired?
Did anyone see you?
The village is far away.
What made you mad?
How do you know that?
I forgot.
He's in a pension.
I don't know what to do next.
There's no current from the morning.
There's a hole in my pants.
Tom's working extraordinary.
He's really speaking well.
I think you're making a mistake.
I've never heard Tom complaint before.
They're probably drunk.
I'll show you where you're going.
I don't have a personal space.
We have something for you.
I just finished my homework in French.
Tom just made it.
I didn't expect Tom to be there.
How old are your cousins?
Your French has improved considerably.
What's in your suitcase?
By the end of March, we'll get married.
He raised his hands.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Good luck to you.
I think Tom was trying to warn us about something.
He married a nice girl.
I took care of it.
Are you not interested?
It's something quite different.
His brothers, his sisters, or he himself will go to the station to meet his father.
I gave up on Tom.
He disappeared without a lead.
You're very brave.
Speaking of travel, have you ever been to Cobe?
I have to go to the market; I'll be there in an hour.
Mary's tall.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Can I have the bill, please?
Let's ask her.
I'm changing the train on the other station.
I heard you encouraging me.
I'll borrow you this book.
I don't remember that.
Where did you buy flowers?
I won't work here for long.
We want our own house.
I have to say that.
Theory's supposed to do the job.
And Tom and Mary can speak French.
It's personal.

You better not go.

I plan to study abroad next year.
Can you count to the French table?
I think you owe me an explanation.
I need to find another.
You have to leave now.
The snow was next to the knee.
I feel bad today.
It's so sad to watch Tom ask for money on the street after he lost all his money on the gambling.
I've never seen anything like that before.
You're not the only one there.
Do you understand me?
Do you speak Turkish?
I put it in your room.
There's no one at home.
He still wants to come.
We have to postpone the honor.
Tom looks great.
What could Tom do there?
I think that's Tom.
Exactly what I said that could happen, happened.
I was trained in this school.
Good afternoon.
I think that'll be interesting.
How long does the shuttle get to the airport?
Tom thought Mary was untied, but he wasn't quite sure.
Go to the park.
She hated him.
Tom's not busy.
Find an expert.
His initiation failed because of the lack of funds.
I'm sure Tom can't speak French.

The Aristocrat holds the glory of his past.
How many times a day are you flying to Tokyo?
I won't be able to move Tom on the other side of the bridge.
I don't do that.
I've seen this before.
It's in the kitchen.
Any questions?
The lightning hit Tom's house.
The miracles are called miracles because they don't happen!
It's too big.
What's the minimum salary in Australia?
I'm just curious.
The city is located in the bottom of the mountain.
She's a lot higher than I am.
It's getting harder.
Tom opened his eyes and saw Mary.
You're going to London next Sunday, aren't you?
Are you carrying money in you?
Why didn't you tell me before?
I'll be back next week.
Stay with me, Tom.
The old man gave the baby a shelter.
See you later.
I'd like to live near your house.
I think we were lucky.
I have to end this.

Can I come see you at the office tomorrow morning?
It's embarrassing that I had to leave my job right when I started going deep into it.
I have to prevent this from happening.
We were eating.
Are you drinking?
Take your shoes.
His wife is exhausted after watching the children.
They won't help you.
If the time allows, we'll leave in an hour.
I have information about Tom.
Be careful, I don't want you to get hurt.
I think you should look at him one more time.
I made a mistake.
It's gonna happen.
Where's Nim?
I love movies so much.
He sticks to his customs.
Remember what she said?
I didn't steal anything.
Tom didn't seem busy.
You don't have to wear a skin coat.
What's the matter, Tom?
We'll talk again later.
He has too many books.
Tom really doesn't like you.
I think you should go back to Boston.
He may have understood you wrong.
I totally agree with your opinion.
I forgot about it.
I think that's yours.
You can't talk seriously.
How long ago did you start learn French?
I think Tom died.
Women; their fraud has no limits.
I can't buy you this dress.
This coat doesn't have pockets.
They're not my enemies.
I have no idea who this is.
Excuse me, where are the bathrooms?
I think I might have lost my job.
Looks like I'm gonna have to lace the labs again.
The movie cried her out.
Tom's playing the piano.
I'll contact you in a second.
Haven't I met you before?
Who's your favorite breed dog?
She gave me a wonderful gift.
There's no grass on the moon.
I don't want it anymore.
Are you done with lunch?
I always keep a few beach towels in my car.
I hope you give me permission to use it.
I waited a month.
Before I run, I always tie my shoes tight.
I don't care what's going to happen.
Is that your bike?
Please don't start again.
Ken's older than Seiko.
The bridge's building.
I'll tell you the truth.
I didn't want that.
My name is Jack.
We're going to school to learn.
Tom could be alive.
Guys, you guys are very bad.
I understand what you mean.
I think you should think about it.
Tom looks like a psychic ruin.
He's an unnecessary garbage.
How long have you been in Bulgaria?
The sky is clean.
We spent our holiday in Sweden.
I'm sorry, I have no idea.
She had her old shoes and both new shoes.
Africa is a continent, but Greenland is not.
It can't be.
There was no one else on the road.
I'm not the manager.
As for travel, have you ever been to Kobe?
I don't intend to do this.
I'll love you forever.
I'm running.
Tom didn't notice Mary.
I have to recharge the batteries.
This shirt should be washed.
Why are you talking French?
Lincoln released slaves.
Tom was wearing his socks upside down.
Mike speaks good Japanese.
I hope that happens.
Tom can't have him.
What's your phone number?
His identity must be kept in secret.
I've learned Tom of everything I know.
I think you'll like it there.
Now you do it.
I haven't written my entire homework yet.
What prevented you from coming here yesterday?
I've read this story in a book.
You're late.
That's not what I wanted to do.
I support you with my whole heart.
I haven't thought of Tom for years.
She gave us an unreasonable answer.
Please show me more.
He loves baseball and football.
Is she thinking of going to America this year?
I thought you might be mad at me.
On the contrary, I've never said that.
I'll get my duck today.
Do you like this blouse?
Everybody says that.
I don't want to study today.
They were fighting.
Do you have a lighter?
Don't look directly at Tom.
I wish I could go to Japan.
John's laughing at his dog.
If I have to tell the truth, I was driving my father's car without his permission.
Stop it, it hurts.
The meal included dessert, and the drink.
She's speaking high.
Can you do me a big favor?
God created man by his image and similarity.
Wasn't I right?
If Tom smiles more often, he'd probably have more friends.
I want you to tell me everything you know about Tom.
Let's start translating!
The food wasn't that bad at all.
Actually, I don't like traveling so much.
He's standing on the scene.
What's the minimum salary in Jamaica?
You have to be careful.
Let's play something.
Our shirts are in one color but different sizes.
What town is this?
What are these tales?
There are 340 types of colibris.
I told you to stay away.
This winter hasn't rained too much of snow.
Bob was very happy.
Please open the bottle.
I think they know me.
Today there was a false alarm twice.
I don't speak Japanese.
I have to say goodbye.
Ken calls me every day.
Tom's playing lacrosse.
Come down.
I haven't seen Tom for a while.
I'm teaching French.
Tom dripped his chew.
Does Tom know why you weren't at his party?
They won't force me.
He asked my mother.
I tried to contact Tom.
Tom's speech was great.
Life is unfair.
I can't find my glasses.
I don't doubt that.
Let's split our bill.
I'm early.
I've waited so long for him.
Do you dream French?
I like that music.
They're early.
I understand why Tom's late.
Come, if you can.
Tom broke up with his girlfriend.
I'm used to eating alone.
I fell asleep reading the book.
I think you're perfect.
I'm afraid it can't be a word for a promotion right now.
This message was in French.
Tom doesn't think Mary's lying to him, but I know she's lying.
Let's drink.
Tom finished high school in three years without a missing day or a delay.
Tom didn't want to move to Boston.
Let's hurry.
And Tom and Mary were wearing slippers.
Is there any change?
Looks like Tom's sleeping.
We laughed at Tom.
Give me your homework.
I think you deserve more.
Will you call me tonight?
It just happened.
I didn't want to blow it up.
Let's just let it go.
I'm sick of watching TV.
She tried to swim.
I'll go in.
I've told you about this before.
I wish I could go see Tom, but what's the use?
I'll buy you.
I've never seen you around here before.
I don't talk to laying dogs.
Yeah, I think I'll stay here if my dad lets me.
I didn't see his lies.
I need to get something to Tom.
Tom's just warming up.
Tom translated a French novel to English.
I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.
I don't think you understand the main thing.
My friends say I speak better French when I'm drunk.
We're a good team.
Kate hasn't come yet?
We need less talks and more action.
It's time to say good-bye.
My mother was busy making dinner.
Give me your book, please.
This camera was made in Germany.
I've finished the Kyoto University.
I like your car.
She lives in London.
He won't change his mind.
I told you to watch Tom carefully.
Everything's impossible for the theory until it's done.
This rule is stupid.
I really don't know what to say.
Obviously he lied.
Are we sure we want to hire Tom?
Those dogs are big.
Who's your favorite composer?
What are the conditions?
I had a bad week.
Come whenever you want.
I have three questions for you.
Can you do it yourself?
I didn't write that.
Peter and Carol weren't thinking about where to spend their vacation.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
I'll be out tomorrow.
You should have called in advance.
No one can deny the fact.
Can I use your car today?
Are you alone?
Tom went to the desk.
Sometimes I fall, but I never give up.
Tom and Mary are great friends.
You have no reason to think that way.
Don't take my flowers again.
It just came out.
I'm not that stupid.
I'm starting to get used to eating alone.
Tom was avoiding Mary.
My wallet's gone.
Can I go to the bathroom?
His incident prevented him from coming.
Is your mother still alive?
It was good here.
He's using his possibilities in the best way.
I'll get you the money back next week.
I don't have any contrary.
I'm from Brazil.
What I don't want to lose is love.
Please speak higher.
The more you know, the less you know.
Do you have a brother or sister?
Do you need this book?
I wasn't busy.
There's something I need to tell Tom.
Where's the cafeteria?
We spent our rest on a beach in Hawaii.
I haven't seen Tom.
This is Tom's bike, I think.
There are no beaches in this area.
We ate some apples.
I got it for my birthday.
Whoever asks, he's getting a fool in five minutes, but the one who doesn't ask is being a fool forever.
I deleted the board for the teacher.
Are you in love with Tom?
I remember the events so live as it was yesterday.
What's wrong with Tom?
Have you seen my camera?
Your pants' chip is ripped off.
What's on the agenda?
It's their problem, not ours.
Did they shoot you?
Ask Tom yourself.
Read it to me.
Let's talk to each other honestly!
Give me the salt, please.
I'm one of those people who worry about people, so I don't know how to keep speeches.
Is that your bike?
There was a lot of audiences on the piano recital last night.
My tie is orange.
Please remove this thing.
Did you accept his invitation?
I'm not buying anything.
Stay inside.
Why don't you answer?
There are more tests to be done.
We ran down the hill.
I got your letter yesterday.
Thank you for the invitation.
He's eating nothing but fruit.
Behave like a dude.
Tom and I were on a bus stop.
Sometimes I'm watching TV.
You shouldn't be doing the work of others.
If you want to participate, you need to register.
Who's your favorite sport?
Tom speaks French much better than Mary.
She's Tom's sister.
I'm sick of it.
The baby slept deeply.
Please don't cry.
Are you depressed?
Tom's shocked.
We're in trouble.
There's something in Tom that I don't like.
What an asshole!
Don't take your coat off.
Where's the key?
That's how we can keep going forever.
He said he didn't go into the room that was a lie.
Tom wasn't at the meeting.
I wonder if you could help me.
I met your father yesterday.
Please think about it.
Looks like he's going to Cashgar.
Speak slowly and clear.
I suspect Tom won't want it.
That's a good plan.
Tom saw a vase with flowers on the table by the window.
Are you ready?
Can I see it?

Thai is the official language of Thailand.
I don't blame you.
Romanians from Transylvania speak very slowly.
Tom started to untie his shoes.
There are nearly seven billion people around the world.
I don't expect you to remember.
We have to deal with this problem right now.
Everybody took a picture position.
I would never hurt him.
My knife's sharp.
Am I right?
You won't be able to see Tom today.
I'm not gonna shut up.
You need to learn more.
Don't go through the lobby.
The truck dropped the street lamp and the light.
That's a nice coat.
I made my efforts to improve my success.
The scripts were predictable.
Bring me the paper, please.
I only have two children.
I've never seen anything so beautiful.
These are Tom's glasses.
She's bathing the baby.
I got an idea.
Go get it.
This must be nice for everyone.
I could make her happy.
That's not a bad thing.
I haven't seen you Tom since his birthday.
Yankees won Dodgers.
For the truth, I love him very much.
Tom always seemed happy.
I'm going to work with a bus.
What's the news?
The fog prevented the planes from flying.
I've never seen the darkness before.
The milk freezes and it gets tough.
Tom plays a guitar too.
I've read this story in a book.
It's just water.
I've never seen anything like that before.
Yes or not?
The incident caused death to many people.
She went down the stairs.
Tom has to get a death sentence.
Tom just wanted to introduce himself as a good neighbor.
Do I need a tie?
Are you hurt?
I haven't been here much.
No man can have two masters.
I have no idea what that means.
What makes you think I won't be able to do this?
You look terrible.
That's something I have to do on my own.
Do we already have this text?
She slammed him.
Why can't I go to Tom's party?
Grace hasn't come yet.
These old laws were cancelled.
The apple fell!
Let's talk about the solar energy.

Are you a student?
I speak French almost every day.
I think you'll like this one.
He asked for some money.
Tom put on the right blinker.
It's not Tom's fault.

That's 30 euros.
Are you coming?

George likes to talk.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
I convinced Tom to help me.
Unfortunately, she's gone.
Nothing's been thrown out yet.
How are you these days?
It was done.
The bank wants his money back.
I'm not trying to escape.
I thought Tom didn't like you.
We'll work on it.
Get out of the computer.
I think my clock's off.
Bill could run faster than Bob.
You two have nothing to do with it.
Grace seemed mad.
Tom opened his backpack.
I haven't seen you for almost three years.
We'll visit our uncle next week.
I don't get my shoe, it's very small.
A short walk on the beach brought me an appetite for breakfast.
I have no idea who you are.
Don't worry about that.

Bring him in.
John can't live in London now.
Drugs are cancer of modern society.

Music is kind of entertainment.
I'm not afraid of them.
Tom didn't speak French very well.
He's my dad.
I don't understand the problem; I can't say anything specific about it.
He was my best friend.
Can you come in Sunday night?
I was jealous of his new house.
We need to be fair.
Will it fail in the test?
How much do I owe you?
I like learning French.
I think Tom's sick.
Eye for eye, teeth.
I don't know much French words.
It's not a game.
I like to invite my friends home.
What's in the suitcase?
Please turn off your cigarettes before you get into the museum.
I introduced myself well on the test.
I think you should take it.
I'm sorry about what I said.

Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
Why aren't you and Tom?
I have the keys.
I'm already a full-year-old.
Do I have the right to accompany you?
Would you call Tom?
You'll regret it!
I've seen them all.

I didn't know we had to do this.
Looks like our money's over.
I'm serious.
Can we help Tom?
She raised her voice.
Unfortunately, this is not the case.

Tom's awake.
I'll borrow you this disk, provided you don't borrow it to anyone else.
You have to decide, and then, right away.
Because you can usually find a lot of websites on a topic, I usually click on the back button when you get on some web site with popup ads. I just go to the next page that Google offers me, and I hope it is less irritating.
The dog's dying.

I got your file.
No one here ever tells me anything.
I gave every single gift.
The museum doesn't work on Sunday.
Your answer is wrong.
She remembers Mr. Black's car.
They put Tom in jail.
My mother feels better.
Tom just got home.
Don't put it on the rain.
They talk very fast.
What time is it now?
Can I eat this orange?
Mary likes romantic comedies.
What are they drinking?
Let's be friends.
As far as I know, he must have been born in Italy.
"But really?" "Yes, really."
Don't tell anyone.
I'm surprised this building still stands.
I need to meet Tom.
Although sometimes the English Tom looks pretty good, he has no idea where his possibilities are spread and it is impossible to convince him that he is wrong when he makes a mistake.
Are you John?
America needs you.
You have to decide.
I saw a lot of tourists on the beach.
I heard you fight with Tom.
Will you answer it?
What's your home address?
Outside the dog, the book is a man's best friend, and it's too dark in the dog to read.
It doesn't work.
My mother made me a very cute sex.
You've got to start now.
It's an old letter.
Are you involved in some publicly useful activities?
Do you care?
Obviously Tom was famous before he released that album.
The Romans wouldn't have had any chance to conquer the world if they first had been required to learn Latin.
I paid $50,000.
Don't drink that.
I think we better get out of here.
Aren't you married?
That's what you always wanted.
I'd like you to translate this document to French.
Tom was fired.
Clear the table already!
Mary's interested in politics.
She won't believe it.
Do you speak Turkish?
Don't hesitate to ask questions.
Bees make honey.
Tom doesn't want to admit he doesn't know how to do it.
I'm the only one who knows them.
In this city, they've been getting iron for 350 years.
I'm playing a television game.
He was in Japan.
Let's take a walk.
Are you still collecting mailmarks?
My name is Ichiro Tanaka.
The imports exceeded exports last year.
You don't have a temperature.
Did anyone tell you that?
I'm not afraid of death, I just don't want to be there when it happens.
Don't let him do it.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
I put my coat on the table.
This is the place.
A woman in a wheelchair is hiding in a supermarket.
This is your last chance to spend some time with Tom.
Can you speak French well?
What kind of man would have done something like that?
I don't like snow.
Jane was waiting, washing her back in the tree.
Thank you, we'll do the best we can.
Let's get upstairs and talk.
Tom didn't call me.
Tom doesn't like chess.
Those clothes are good for you.
I've been studying French for three years.
I think you should go out now.
Please leave.
I thought you didn't like Tom.
Tom seems really happy.
Until yesterday, I never heard Tom speak French.
She's French.
The soldiers are used to dangers.
I know a little French.
Please write your contact address here.
Have a nice appetite!
I knew you'd find Tom.
We arrived first.
Will you do it?
The police found a body thrown out on the shore near here.
We all speak French.
The gentleman knows the value of his own life.
I appreciate you coming to pick me up.
See if you turned off the TV before you fell asleep.
And my hands were shaking.
From now on, be more careful.
Tom jumped into the cold water.
Are you registered?
If there's no life after death, you better do something with this life.
I hope for you to make things better, Tom.
Let me help you.
Don't let yourself be used.
I think you're the ones who need help.
The corridor's slippery, be careful.
Languages like Russian, Polish, Czech and Bulgarian have common Slovenian roots.
Tom has to do this now.
You shouldn't say that to your parents.
Let's say things honestly!
She's the woman I gave the gift to.
Let me go alone.
I don't understand what he said.
This situation is funny.
This land is on Tom.
I think you should meet Tom.
Do not add annotations.
He's not here yet.
Your soul will be mine!
Many of my friends can speak French.
He's playing a good gitara.
Have you played Myncroft?
Nancy's afraid of dogs.
You'll be surprised what people think.
Are you taking any medicines right now?
The tree's burning.
I heard every word you said.
I haven't agreed yet.
I have to admit I'm sorry.
Jack speaks English.
I want to see you.
I'm not jealous.
We've been in line to drive.
Can I get your coat?
My dad's gonna make me a delicious feast tomorrow morning.
My television's broken.
Tom just shut the phone.
Are you ready?
I won't believe it until I hear it from Tom.
Tom can't see you.
I'm sure you're busy.
Come see us.
Looks like you had a tough day.
Tom doesn't give up.
But I want you to understand what I'm saying.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe that at all.
I haven't spoken to Tom yet.
Are you involved?
What did you do with the camera?
I continued to take a picture.
Today, less teenagers work.
Why am I still listening to this?
Please don't.
Tom's handwriting isn't very beautiful, but it's readable.
Shoichi's face's bladder.
Electric stream can generate a magnetic field.
Would you mind if I turned the radio on?
I have to do things tomorrow.
The tower was broken on the soup and dust.
America is very big.
I heard him stop the car.
Send her my greetings.
Is your wife blonde or is she brunette?
I'm out there. I'm driving my bike.
The men were carrying the boy to the hospital.
They talked too fast to find out what they said.
Tom's injured!
Are you sure Tom knows what he's got to do?
Can we trust her?
That's the camera that Tom made the photos with.
Let's see TV.
He killed that man.
Do good to those who hate you.
I have to go.
What's the whole story?
Don't push me.
What are your plans for Christmas?
Another bottle of wine, please.
It's time to go to work.
You were given an opportunity.
Would you like to put the vessels in the wash?
We found where he lives.
It's not that deep.
He's a great scientist.
She wants a divorce.
My new magazine seemed very interesting.
Maybe we can help Tom.
We went on a journey full of hope.
I'll be here.
I don't feel like wood.
I think you're really amazing.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom helped Mary move the closet.
Tell Tom to explain.
What's your relationship with him?
I'm Tom Hunter.
That's a little weird for me.
Can you do it yourself?
The spring days are getting longer.
Mary let Tom kiss her.
I've never seen you cry.
Sometimes I hear my father singing in the bathroom.
In Singapore, they speak English.
I eat bread.
That request was rejected.
You were right.
He was tired, and yet he went to help them.
Tom's not going to school next week.
Do as I say.
The kids are already tired.
You want to watch a French movie, right?
We played for winning.
What's in the coffee?
The circle's burned.
I have to get Tom's money back.
As many books he has, that's what I have.
They didn't find Tom.
Are you sure you don't want to wait until tomorrow?
I'll always remember your kindness.
This smell and the other time I felt it.
Everybody dies.
I don't understand.
Give me a knock.
He hates shopping.
I think you'll be happy.
I didn't tell him everything.
I don't want her to give up.
Mary's a book worm.
I think you're capable of everything.
He objected to her plan.
I don't think we should do that.
You're not gonna be alone.
Looks like the dog wants to eat something.
This box is a little harder than it should be.
It's a famous mountain.
I could make you happy.
He told me how to get to the museum.
He likes to go fishing.
Is Tom still at school?
Texas is almost twice the size of Japan.
Either you do them, or you!
I hope it's not too late.
His clothes always smell bad.
I think you should listen to me.
I forgot your number.
I was there only once.
Put your jacket on the hanging door.
Tom lives three blocks from the shore.
He's something a little famous.
I love pizza so much.
I'll try it again.
Just answer the question.
Leave it for another man.
Tom admitted he was scared.
If you listen a little more carefully what the teacher says, you'll probably understand.
I think you should check under the bed.
The movie wasn't as fun as the book.
The job didn't drag me.
I think you're perfect.
Each human being is part of all of us called Universe - part limited in time and space. It considers itself, its thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest - a kind of optical illusion of his mind. This illusion is a kind of prison for us, limiting us within our personal desires and the commitment to our closest people. Our task is to free ourselves from this prison, expanding the circle of our compassion, so that it encompasss all living creatures and nature in all and beauty.
He will certainly come.
I'm familiar.
You're not going?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
Should I fill this form in French?
This local newspaper is published once a week.
I don't know who it is.
It's almost three hours.
I want to know more about you, Tom.
He just became the director.
We're studying French.
I think Tom and Mary like each other.
What's that thing?
Never give dog food to your cat.
I have a problem with the French grammar.
I stabbed him in the face.
I'll make you happy.
You won't believe it.
Do I have to open everything?
Now it's totally different.
You're always late.
Let's keep going.
The walls were painted in light cafÃ©.
Betty killed him.
Have you started learning French yet?
You can't read French, can you?
Your blouse is very good with this sex.
Can't you do anything?
Lucy's from America.
You really want to work in Boston?
Tom's not lying down.
Are you involved?
It's very big.
Tom just got back from Boston.
Ask again later.
He's my older brother.
She's become famous.
She refused his invitation.
We pray for peace.
I think you'll be very interesting.
I didn't insult you on "bullshit."
He and I are friends.
Our best friend is a doctor.
There's something in Tom that makes me nervous.
Both Tom's parents were teachers.
Don't play baseball here.
Is Tom alive away from here?
The bad time didn't let me go.
She's a nice girl.
Bob's a nice man.
Looks like he's happy.
My legs have come out of sharks.
Why is this so funny?
Follow my example and take a glass of wine.
Are you John?
I forbid smoking in my room.
I need to figure out when Tom's going to leave.
She read the letter.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
He shot me.
Dogs are allowed.
Everyone thinks of a change in the world, but nobody thinks about change of himself.
She wants to divorce.
You need to learn hard.
Did you accept his invitation?
If you don't want to be alone, I can make you company.
I heard shots.
I didn't intend to put you in a uncomfortable situation.
For whom did you translate this?
If there's a desire, there's a way.
I think Tom made a big mistake.
If you relax and rest, you'll feel much better.
Are you done with breakfast?
I've got a few old computers.
Tom was wondering where she spent her childhood, Mary.
Are you coming or not?
Do you speak Georgian?
And Tom and Mary pulled out their weapons.
Are the cats dreaming?
Do you know that girl?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
This is the hotel where Tom usually stays.
Tom was sweating.
You better not go.
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
Let's go ask her.
We usually speak French.
I'd like a blue that fits this jacket.
I have no idea what Tom said.
He's a kind of star.
I thought Tom could be your girlfriend.
You always complain.
The milk's soaked.
The second lesson is very easy.
I love your name.
We have to protect our children.
I'll stay home.
Take one of these.
What's your relationship with him?
The devil's custom must be forgotten.
My brother said he wasn't afraid of the darkness.
Tom really hates him.
The problem was, I had nothing to tell him.
I think Tom was really having fun.
I wouldn't do that.
Why don't you take your coat off?
Let's talk seriously about your future.
I have a few calls, too.
Whatever happens, we'll make them talk.
Would you be so kind to close that window?
The old couple went on a trip around the world.
When I woke up, there was no one at home, and I was abandoned all day.
My mathematics is my favorite object.
What day do you usually rest?
Tom's back to pick up his coat.
I'd better go see what Tom found.
Tom came home with a bladder-coated target.
Have you actually tried?
The storm prevented the plane from flying.
Tell me you got some good news.
What browser do you use?
I remember what he said.
What's the minimum salary in your country?
I think you should think about it again.
I missed you so much.

Is this your book, Mike?
I usually run every surrine.
The bell rings at eight o'clock.
Mr. Smith is accused of the passage of the treaty.
Ken runs faster than you.
They talked to each other.
Are you sleeping, sweetheart?
She's born twins.
Five gallons normal, please.
I haven't been here much.
Take care.
That's very big.
I think you'll be surprised.
Do you speak German?
Put your coat on.
I bought some books from the bookstore.
Be loved.
There was a terrible accident yesterday.
He answered the questions correctly.
Put your tourist shoes on and don't waste time.
Why did you come so early?
If it's sued by your great shadow, you seem to have spent most of your vacation on the beach.
It's probably going to be a snow tomorrow.
I have no idea who Tom is.
Laura may have been sick.
Tom knows what's really going on.
Tom can resist.
She was perfect.
I have to keep trying.
There was a museum of art in this area before.
I thought your feelings might have changed.
Sooner or later, his luck will be over.
It looks like it's gonna rain tonight.
Anne has no sisters.
Is it really so hard to speak French?
When was the last time you were on the train?
Tom saw him, too.
I'm not trying to push you.
You're running.
Don't stay in bed unless you can make money from bed.
Tom has to do this now.
I could make you happy.
My dear, if eating isn't ready in seven hours, I'll go to the restaurant.
He let me wait long.
I'll be right away.
They made us work all night.
He really likes English.
I've heard about your party.
They have to change their attitude.
Do you want me to repeat the question?
The book is interesting.
She was young.
They're hiding in the closet.
What's the minimum salary in Russia?
He loves her.
Try to figure out when the train goes.
You have to deal with French more seriously.

It's a big nonsense of you to say that.
They have to pay in advance.
Do you like music?
He was born and grew up in Tokyo.
I'm pretending to work.
She waited till the water shuts up before she made her tea.
I think Tom speaks French well.
Tom has to leave.
He was very patient.
It's unlikely that they'll come at this late hour.
The teacher claimed that in three months he would do so that we could all speak French without spiting.
I caught three fish yesterday.
He goes there every day.
There's been a disaster.
Have you ever heard anyone speaking French?
And no word about what I told you.
We want to hire an apartment in town.
I think you should come down here.
We arrived yesterday afternoon with a train.
Tom's gone, but Mary's still here.
Choose your favorite rocket.
I'll buy you a sushi.
Come on, that's all for today.
My brother says he's not afraid of the darkness.
Save a man, eat a cannibal.
Everything looks fine.
Are you sure you don't want me to help you?
Tom speaks French horrible.
Don't you accept credit cards?
Tom's drinking water.
Did he offer you?
You want me to help you?
You shouldn't go.
Please give me an envelope.
What's Tom afraid of?
You always sing.
I totally forgot about Tom.
I wouldn't be so sure.
My dad was on his way to leave when the phone called.
He asked about you.
Ken never went to Kyoto.
His fog stopped seeing away.
Anne's a cheerleader.
I'm trying to learn English.
Tom went to the mail to send a letter.
Look carefully on the wall map.
Maybe it's not enough.
Don't send me any more notes.
Are you sure you don't want to drive?
I think you'll be very interesting.
I haven't seen you for almost three years.
I haven't taken a shower for three days.
I lost my shape.
Bring me a chair, please.
It wasn't a stupid idea.
Maybe you'll be happier on another job.
I like your shirt.
That's very important.
Thank you for your work.
Drive right on the road and when you cross the lightfarm, you're there.
Do whatever you want.
Some people would definitely ask, why don't we just get our things together and get out of Afghanistan?

Would you help me translate this?
America has enemies.
Did you see Tom?
We'll be back.
Give it back to me!
Say hello to Jimmy from me.
I haven't spoken to Tom for three weeks.
Stop screwing.
I know what Tom is doing here.
I know a man who speaks French well.
I think you were wrong.
He didn't mind staying awake all night.
You probably already know about our company.
I think you asked enough questions.
Tom doesn't have to know that.
Some people have inconvenience to travel through the sea.
My plane leaves at six o'clock.
I don't know any of the boys.
We're ready to go.
That's evidence.
It's really delicious.
While I'm alive, you won't be deprived of anything.
Maria showed us their home.
I heard steps, but I didn't see anyone.
Is that our problem?
He gave her one sheet.
Uncle gave me his car.
I really appreciate that.
Tom put his wire.
I've never seen anything like that before.
I have an opinion.
I did it myself.
My name is Emily.
Nothing else's done.
I have to get dressed.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
I haven't understood that yet.
I need to talk to Tom.
Last night, the game was exciting.
The wide jackets are the last screaming of the fashion.
Don't get lost.
With a little good will on both sides, our problems should be solved.
I don't have much money.
She quickly climbed up the stairs.
The house we used to live was broken down.
I'm getting married next week.
The prices will continue to rise.
We learn French together.
In high school, my French was my favorite object.
Would you call Tom?
Nobody knows if he loves her or not.
Get me out of this side of the world, please.
I think Tom's hiding from Mary.
Oh, I was sick.
Show us it.
Why don't you laugh?
Have you ever congratulated PfirsichbÃ¤umchen in German?
There's been an accident.
I would never hurt them.
I know about this research.
Wouldn't it be nice?
I don't know French, but Greek, completely.
He made it clear that he was against the plan.
She can jump high.
Why am I sleeping so much?
She answered through her tears.

I'm studying French at home.
Don't raise that noise, please.
Have any of you ever seen Tom?
I'll go alone.
He's stronger than you.
I'm dangerous.
Show me that list.
That's all Tom has to do.
Our son is married, and we want to make our heads up.
Don't go to that building.
Why isn't Tom at school?
Will you eat this cookie?
I worked hard last month.
I knew he'd accept.
Don't leave town.
I heard Tom and Mary talk.
We met in London.
Do you have any wine?
This could be a little bothering.
Looks like our water's finished.
Take what you like.
I have to tell Tom.
That was very personal.
Do they both understand French?
Something was taken.
The green is Alice's.
Our bullshit is gathering three times a week.
They caught the fox in the trap.
You're early.
You love kids, don't you?
I felt isolated.
What do you want?
I'm sad.
They're late for the storm.
I guess it won't be a problem.
Speak slower, if you like.
"Where do you live?" "I live in Tokyo."
I'm busy right now.
I feel so bad.
We were soldiers.
The work is not only necessary, but also the pleasure.
We need to be careful.
It's 11 now.
I run every day.
I think that's Tom there.
How was the last weekend, Nancy?
Do you learn French?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I'm not unreasonable.
I have to report this.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
You need to use a dezodorant.
When I stand up, you're the world.
Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
There are some things I need to take care of.
I never question his honesty.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not going to do this.
You don't look too surprised.
This is a warning that we need to take seriously.
What does the fox say?
We'd like to eat, can you serve us fast?
Let's get a sake.
Tell me a joke.
Tom practices speaking French at every opportunity.
I've seen Tom do amazing things.
The apples are red.
You have nice hands.
People are generally against war.
Your hair needs haircut.
I'm better.
Tom never met me before.
Can I see your driver's license?
That's never gonna end.
Tom teaches me French twice a week.
Why don't you just tell us what's bothering you?
Maybe they have something.
I could make you happy.
Who hurts your teeth?
We learn French.
What makes you think that?
You sat in my seat.
We know who you are.
Do you like black cats?
We learn French every day in school.
Do you believe in miracles?
I think you'll be nicely surprised.
Tom looks lonely.
Let me tell you something about myself.
I haven't seen Tom since I was 13 years old.
Her hobby is to collect postmarks.
I don't have anything.
Have you ever painted this house?
If we were expected to speak more than listen, we would have been given by two mouths and one ear.
Don't play baseball here.
I got your coat.
We did great last night.
I'm going to Detroit.
You won't believe how popular Tom has become.
Did you do it?
My father often takes me to baseball games.
Are you brothers?
I felt very uncomfortable because I didn't speak French.
Tom's friend threatened to leave him.
Are you afraid of something?
He hasn't known anything since he left for America.
I'm gonna have to handle this now.
I had my hands in my pockets .
I would never hurt them.
What's your son's name?
I've never seen you so nervous.
He's become a big musician.
I'm counting on you.
Aren't you nervous?
Have you heard from your sister recently?
They're all hungry.
She went down the stairs.
I was alone, I was studying.
I didn't tell Tom.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
I think you'd better sit down.
Our sales fall.
I saw Bob this morning.
Get me something to eat.
If you have not paid for distraction, please send the long amount and allow us to remove the problem immediately.
It smells like a toilet here.
I'm here for a vacation.
Looks like you're alone.
The question is being considered.
Tom was saved by a random passer.
The city is in the center of the city.
They're not hungry.
Call me if you need me.
Let's change the subject.
The bar is full of people.
I'm so hungry.
It's very kind of you to step away from your way to help me.
Tom thought Mary's story was interesting.
How about we stop the car and rest?
Tom lives in the same part of the city where Mary lives.
Now it's a little after 11 without a quarter.
Both sentences are correct.
I've never seen the darkness before.
We need to call the police.
I have information about Tom.
I'm sure this book has never been translated to French.
I'll see you again.
I'll try it again.
No one could sleep this night.
Rounda's continued for about five minutes.
He was running around the country.
The sum of all corners in the triangle is 180 degrees.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
Mary can speak Japanese.
I need to call Tom.
It's a little cold today.
I'll judge you.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Who let the dogs go?
I don't feel sick.
I can't even read French, but what's left to say?
I'll do my best.
I'll come with Tom.
Mike swims very well.
Be careful!
I want a boat that will take me away from here.
Let's talk.
The diamonds are the girl's best friends.
Since he was young, his parents died, so his uncle raised him.
I've seen Tom do what's impossible.
I have to warn him.
Where's the station?
Don't throw anything away.
What's going on up there?
The dog couldn't lay.
Is it safe?
He's asleep as a baby.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
I'll follow your instructions.
I have a sharp knife.
You painted the walls, didn't you?
My mother teaches flower arrangements.
What a beautiful time!
Don't waste your youth, otherwise you'll regret it.
I think you'll be interesting.
But isn't he above the law?
A modern factory is completely automated.
Don't let Tom scare you.
English acquisition is difficult.
I think you should join us.
Can I open a can?
I didn't do it on purpose.
I haven't seen Tom lately.
I think Tom's got his leg broken.
Tom told me he wanted to live on a lonely beach.
Why did Tom want to learn French?
This is where Tom was born.
Where are you born?
I asked him to send us the book.
I have no idea what's going on.
You're all fools.
They exchange gifts.
I personally don't mind.
Mr. Kott's Japanese food began to like him.
I put the money in the safe.
We're hurrying.
Tom heard something.
I hope that's enough.
You need to get this fact out of the way.
This one's okay.
I was your mother's first girlfriend.
Tom teaches me to speak French.
Would you like to tell me something about yourself?
I think that's very unlikely.
I want to find my account.
I'm sure Tom knows enough French to get better.
I went to swim in the river.
Mary's Tom's older sister.
I don't know any of the boys.
Guests have to start coming soon.
I'm crazy about football.
Looks like it'll rain.
It was very nice to meet you!
This isn't your house.
I didn't see anything.
Hey, I just got here.
I'm a hero.
Damn you!
Tom pushed Mary from the edge of the rock.
I hope Tom's right.
Aren't you happy?
Prepare for the worst.
Fruits of the wax under the sun.
She's always late for school.
Tom made some mistakes on the control system.
Time's on my side.
Aren't you happy?
It might take a while.
I thought you could get back.
Let me help you put your coat on.
Be careful, the car's coming!
She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this sweater?
Take him with you.
Now I remember, you don't have to smoke in her car.
Nancy smiled happyly.
He's only four minutes away with a train.
What is Tom trying to achieve?
Can anyone trust you?
It's a little fat.
I think we'd better go.
Tom said it probably won't take too much time.
What's the real reason you don't want to do this?
Can you keep a secret?
Hey, guys, let's keep quiet!
I would never hurt them.
I've been studying French.
Can't you stay a little longer?
We stayed in Dorchester.
Are you depressed?
While we were on vacation, a neighbor took care of the cat.
Both Tom's parents were teachers.
The kids need to listen to their parents.
It's soft today.
Do you live in this neighborhood?
They made us work all day.
I think you're capable of everything.
He came home after he was away ten months.
We're moving to Boston next week.
I've never met Tom before.
I called him yesterday.
Let's rest here.
I need to see Tom.
I think you should leave.
I think we're intriguing Tom.
I'll get the next bus.
Tom's twice older than Mary.
Mary has two girlfriends.
Kate speaks English very quickly.
I'm not so tired.
You have a vein infection.
He started writing a novel.
He's satisfied with the results.
Hurry up and you can catch your train.
You won't need that anymore.
Get it back where you got it.
Let's start.
I screwed you up.
Tom found out Mary was stealing from the money in the casino.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little early.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So you did it anyway.
Can you do it on your own?
She's red.
Do you think I'm so stupid?
If you give someone $20 and you never see it again, then it's probably worth it.
That's Jane's bag.
Tom always smiles.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary's attractive?
What's the minimum salary in India?
Don't make a decision on this issue today.
She didn't have much money.
You sat on my seat.
When did Tom die?
These two shirts are made of the same material.
Do you learn French?
You shouldn't give up English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
What's Ken eating?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
Next year we'll go to college.
What are you eating, fish or meat?
I made my check account.
I thought Tom had a holiday.
Why isn't Tom here?
What's Ken doing now?
There's a lot of DNA sentences, but there's no one for the RNA.
One of my parents has to go to the meeting.
Thank you for paying attention to this.
Don't mess your nose.
The wind was blowing.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her big daughter is married.
Tom speaks French much better than any of his classmates.
For 20 students, only one read the book.
I've got work on Wednesday.
Where's my grandfather?
The Japanese have the tendency to trust firm authority.
I went home with a train.
I think I can do it in my free time.
Shall we go out?
They call me Bob.
In what situation would you do that?
What was the name of the guy he was dating before Tom?
Try it again.
I'd like you to translate this letter to French.
I'm really tired and I want to go to bed early.
The French Tom is very good.
I'm not a philosopher.
She lives in New York.
He must be the director of the school.
I bet I'll get there before you.
He was painted like a clown.
It's embarrassing in her presence.
She bought him a dog, but he had allergic to dogs, and they had to give it to others.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
There was no television, no radio at the time.
She went to the taxi museum.
Take care of your job!
He wrote a letter.
I can't agree with Tom.
These socks have holes on the fifth.
Tom likes to plead.
You're a good doctor.
Don't you ever say that word again.
I saw him stop.
She felt her knees were shaking.
Edison invented the electric lamp.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
I'll meet him some other time.
She wasn't that strong.
What a strong wind!
This is my CD, isn't it?
I told you not to look for me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He's dating a group of kids that he shouldn't.
It'll be okay if you don't get involved in personal matters.
Do you have to go to the mail?
My veins bleed every time I use the end for my teeth.
We've arrived fast because the movement wasn't loaded.
You must be careful.
What do you miss?
He came back from France recently.
Molly has a big watch.
Tom doesn't help me.
I haven't been with him for a long time.
Those glasses are going on.
What did you miss?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
He's not eating until the understanding goes through.
I would never lie to you.
Kate's watching the dog.
I don't know everything.
I'll never do that again.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
His friend is a former senator.
Is the French harder than English?
This pair of shoes' shoes aren't good for me.
Are you afraid of something?
I have two cousins.
The lists fall through the fall.
Can't you do anything?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
We can't postpone the meeting.
Since when did Toim learn French?
He was completely exhausted.
Thank you for coming!
Hey, I'm a little sick.
I'm so embarrassed.
Looks like there's more than two thousand Uigurian sentences in Tatieba!
Tom's stubborn.
We can't postpone the gathering.
I'm ashamed that I did that.
Let's cross here.
I know that's hard.
Are you a exchange student?
If you need help, ask.
You've always been a little weird.
Do you think you're going to Tokyo tomorrow?
Hopefully it's worth it.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true that Tom and Mary were arrested?
If humanity does not care about the environment, the environment will destroy mankind.
No, thanks, I'm just looking.
I felt like I was dismissed among these people.
I think you'll have a good night.
Don't get him home yet.
Sorry to interrupt you.
The fact that he's too generous is his greatest lack.
Press the Shift button.
You understand, don't you?
Jane always acted like she was very rich.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yeah, I know it.
I wonder what Tom meant.
It doesn't cost anything.
I don't mind the hot time.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new cards.
I'm thirsty.
Flowers go out without water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to know why Mary didn't like him.
You see, I told you Tom couldn't swim.
I forgot.
The bill, please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Guess what he said to me.
The salt's over.
She forgot to feed her dog.
That's not the problem.
Go meet him and let that letter go.
This chicken didn't take any egg lately.
I hear Tom stole a car.
We weren't hungry.
The dolphins are very intelligent.
Did I disappoint you?
Wait till I finish, please.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
He's very happy that his life in school goes well.
Mrs. Yung didn't mind if I visited her unexpectedly.
You've got nice lips.
Many people will lose their job because of the car industry.
He came to help me.
We'll start the landing down in Honolulu.
I heard you were looking for me.
Our food is finished.
The moment of glory for Hanshine did not last long. They were quickly moved from the first place.
Is there a big house?
Doesn't that lead to trouble?
He was upset that he was called a fool.
Their condition is getting worse.
Do you really want it?
Will he fail in the test?
I can't understand why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What are the conclusions?
Here we are at last!
I'm higher than you.
I think I'm lucky.
Tom could have lied.
I feel good.
She pressed the button.
I didn't feel well, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
I have to move.
He's a famous composer.
Tom put a pepper on the kitchen window to cool.
Happy is the man who married a good woman.
Tom gave me a good advice.
He's always telling the truth.
I can't live like that anymore.
Oh, how pathetic!
Say hello, Jimmy.
Is it good for taste?
Are you going to go?
I heard what happened.
Of course, she's right.
Don't force me to shoot you.
The equator divides the Earth's ball into two hemispheres.
It was personal.
Doesn't it interest you?
It's a great pleasure to watch baseball matches.
I think it's good to get some rest.
When did you start learn French?
She solved her hair in front of the mirror.
I've already done my job.
It wasn't easy.
Do you think it'll rain today?
You're very brave.
There's a bag on the desk.
Where did you throw them out?
How is Tom going to deal with the problem?
The thief got out with the money.
I haven't spoken to you before, have I?
Tom was late for dinner.
That's the picture of my new house.
I want to sleep.
This camera's on Tom, right?
I sent her a doll.
I'm smarter than her.
My uncle gave me the clock.
Please excuse me for the delay.
I felt isolated.
I'm pretty busy.
They're very important.
Are you Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I know a man who can speak French well.
Transfer this sweater.
I'd better stay home.
That's not very funny.
The phone is something you can't do without.
I contacted them a few days ago, but I couldn't get the answer.
Why is your mouth open?
My dad's driving very well.
We need to protect our children.
I'll see you again.
I'm completely exhausted.
I'm just looking at things realistic.
I heard you encouraging them.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
In summer, I'm going to go to France.
Please mix the cards carefully.
Get on the bus for Budstrace and get down to Zeestrase.
Laughter is useful for your health!
It's not a mistake.
I guess you're Tom who everyone told me about.
Add this site to "Preferred".
When the sun of culture is low, even the patches and the coppers throw a big shadow.
When's the museum open?
I've seen you somewhere.
He's sitting on his sandwich.
We just cleaned the bathrooms.
Tom and I have a meeting in the hall.
I'm not going to endanger the threats.
You're in a better shape than me.
Do you have a pile?
I hope it's useful.
He tried it himself.
I'm from the FBI.
Tom's working for me.
He's staying awake until late.
Tom's fine.
I'm walking like a penguin.
Don't change the channel.
Watch where you step.
Can I take your knife?
You have to hand over the report by the end of this week.
I haven't seen you for almost three years.
Are you armed?
I wish you had told me earlier.
Don't look at the camera.
Well, we're gonna go, though.
Tom and Mary didn't speak French.
I did it once.
He didn't listen to my advice.
There were a lot of people on both sides of the street.
Don't make me feel sorry about that.
I thought Tom would cry.
She's her friend.
His clothes always smell.
I want to eat something.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
We're like brothers.
I can't even put the water down, I can't burn the turkey.
What's the name of this river?
Is she free tonight?
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
In the winter, the sixteens are covered with ice.
We almost didn't have time for dinner.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'm a full-year-old.
I want to go.
Get her back!
I'm not telling you to go alone.
I want orange juice.
I would never lie to you.
I won't be surprised if Tom left early.
Tom speaks French as French.
I think we need to make a deal.
I'm just buying a soft toilet paper.
I don't have a problem with that.
Where's the ticket?
I'm really busy.
I think you should go home.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you'll need this.
I hate flying.
What are the other options?
Get me something to drink.
Am I gonna die?
I got a little out of my way while I was dancing, and I climbed up on the table.
I trust you.
How many brothers do you have?
I think you'll remember that.
Please turn this into pounds.
I think Tom lied to us.
I'd like Tom to smile more often.
I just want to sit on the beach and rest for a week.
I'm thirsty.
The bus was shaking in the inequality road.
Tom has the right to know.
The wind of you.
She took her test.
I'm going to study in the library tomorrow.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you do it?
I've met him before.
Tom never gave up.
Tom hasn't been in trouble.
I made a few mistakes on the test.
This book is not Tom's property.
Where was it?
I have to take it off.
Can I do something to help Tom?
Take off your glasses.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work at the hospital.
Tom's already a mature man.
Let's not screw up.
I'm fine.
It's not art, it's a teeth vagina.
I haven't seen you before.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
Take one of these.
You're so responding.
Have you heard of him?
She washed the blouse fast.
Is there anyone with you?
The museum is open for visitors.
Does Tom really want to win?
My grandfather likes to read.
Did you know you were wearing different socks?
He's making a copy.
What color is Tom's car?
You deserve to be happy, darling.
Tom had a single wish.
Please tell the truth.
Tom went out with Mary Friday night, and with Alice on Saturday night.
Looks like it'll rain.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
You can't read French, can you?
That's exactly what I want.
Letter paper.
Some of Tom's students speak French very well.
I can't hear anything.
I'd better make sure.
I won't be able to help you.
He went under the car.
He's writing to his mother from time to time.
Men get in shape driving a bike.
This is not the end of the story yet.
Don't hurry.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Let's get some rest under the tree.
You can improve your English if you want.
Bring me a dry towel.
Jim's name is James.
Is there any other hotels you can recommend me?
This bike belongs to me.
You're kidding!
We need more research.
Are you sure Tom is alone?
You'll never be alone.
Is there a similar expression in French?
Are you talking to me?
You're my best friend.
Anne's a little girl.
Just squeeze your fingers.
I went to the park.
I love playing basketball.
The train arrived with ten minutes late.
She lives in the deep province.
Excuse me.
I don't waste ammunition.
You're my best friend.
I organized a meeting.
I haven't told anyone about us.
That was just stupid.
Are you sure?
Have you ever read any French verses?
Ken didn't run.
I paid the video for five contributions.
I just want to move with you.
She got twenty-one.
I heard it coming out.
My stomach hurts, Doctor.
You don't understand.
What does that mean?
They're coming from Sweden.
Be careful when you cross a loaded street!
A man has to work.
That's intriguing.
What's your nationality?
That part is good.
Merry Christmas!
Come down.
Mary's running.
They're thirsty for the city life.
I'm glad you made it.
The dog was running around the table.
I'll be at my office.
I think we should call Tom.
It happened between eight and ten hours.
Tom wasn't fat.
We're all friends here.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Tom came in a rush with a letter from Judy.
I heard Tom kissed Mary.
I think Tom gave up too easy.
I heard Tom and Mary talk about it.
To eat sushi.
Drop those socks, if you like.
Please be careful in the future.
Tom was obsessed with a panic attack.
Can I open a can?
He was a baseballist.
Don't say that.
He came after you left.
Did you eat breakfast?
The room's completely furnished.
I admire you for your courage.
I'll check upstairs.
Tom travels to first grade.
Don't stay out too late.
I'm taking my day off tomorrow.
I didn't say that either.
It's better to give than take.
Can you take this, if you like?
Jane wrote the letter herself.
Can you solve this task?
I think that's enough for you.
That's what you told me the other time.
It's been six years since I started learning English.
I can't buy you this dress.
I work like a bee.
Brian made Kate wait for him.
I forbid you to smoke.
I noticed that Tom usually doesn't lock his door.
Would you help me translate this?
Tom almost doesn't know anything French.
This is the same hospital where Tom works.
Tom's not that smart.
Why do you want to be a nurse?
Carl seemed very happy.
Linda loves chocolate.
This air conditioner spends a lot of electricity.
Don't get involved with this lovely propaganda.
Tom thinks the death penalty should be cancelled.
First the good God made a man, and then made the woman; and then He regretted the Man, and gave him the tobacco.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you like it?
Guys, don't raise noise.
Don't look them in the eye.
I'll be back in an hour or somewhere.
Does that look familiar to you?
Take your coat.
What kind of money do you have?
That won't change anything.
The building's almost over.
I thought they were unemployed.
I'd better get to work.
Aoi dance.
Today, machines can do a lot for people.
He went for a walk.
Please start now.
I've seen your driver's license.
Where's my room?
Tom's suffering from a flat-law.
Keep digging.
Where's the museum?
"Human foolishness is infinite," I say, and because of this self-cryticism, I consider myself exceptional.
The storm didn't stop, on the contrary, it was getting stronger.
Tom made Mary translate the letter to French.
Unemployment is still high.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't come to the party.
I didn't talk about him.
Is that what Tom would want?
The whole road's going down the hill.
Isn't it embarrassing?
I think you should send Tom to Boston.
Ask Tom again.
I wish things were back like they were.
Show me.
Tom was pulled out last week.
The more you run, the more you're tired.
Don't cover your feelings for that.
Is there anything for me?
Can you open my door?
The girl's an Irish girl.
It'll be a challenge.
I'm sure this won't be necessary.
Tom's often sick.
The key's not in the lock.
What's the minimum salary in Italy?
Tom put the lamp on again.
This bike is mine.
I'm not used to eating angry.
Choose what you like.
Go there and talk to her.
We met at a summer camp.
Don't talk in the classroom.
It's not from me.
When my dad found out I was dating Nimrod Nick, he was very angry.
The teacher made us repeat the word.
Tom died yesterday.
I thought we were gonna breakfast together.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
I think you'll find out Tom's fault.
She put her sweater on.
Sometimes I'm out of money.
Don't worry, Mr. President: with so bad veins, she barely has teeth.
I've never seen you here before.
I think Tom's gonna die.
He lives in a comfortable little house.
Go back to bed.
Why don't you try your dress before you buy it?
Tom killed himself jumping off a rock.
Where are you born?
Those clothes are good for you.
They went straight to their goal.
The boy got in the window.
I haven't started anything yet.
The bill, please.
I thought you'd be happy.
Are you done with dinner?
I heard Tom gave you his grandfather's violin.
Do what you think it's right.
Are you in love with Tom?
The persistence is reimbursed.
They arrived separately.
Speaking French is fun.
Tom won't succeed.
Prepare for the worst.
I believe the Earth is observed by an alien intelligence.
Let's go to the beach.
I think it was a mistake.
My dad's walking in the park.
You're not that old.
He gave each of them one pencil.
Don't bother me, I think.
I think you should let your beard go.
Do you like the French?
Looks like they're ignoring us.
What's going on here?
Are you sure you don't want another alcohol?
Many people share my vision on the matter.
The blue's clean.
A little tea, please.
I have a stupid question.
He finished his great beginning finally.
I have to stay here.
He doesn't have to work.
You just missed the train, didn't you?
The child is not a court to be filled, but a fire to be burned.
I think you should see this.
Don't you speak French?
Order the words in the alphabetical order.
Tom can speak French much smoother than I am.
I'll hide in here.
She took care of her sick husband.
He was playing while he was going.
I looked at the girl between the crowd.
I could make you happy.
I can't speak English. I can't speak German.
I don't have insurance.
He finished Yale with honours in 1921.
I think I have a way to save you for a while.
My name is Roberto.
I opened the door and kept it open for Mary.
From milk, we make cheese and butter.
How many episodes of One Piece have you seen?
I didn't think about it seriously.
I'm a vacation this week.
If a sick woman gathers a thousand paper sheets, her desire will come true.
I'm surprised this building still stands.
I don't owe you at all!
The bus driver didn't see a walker.
Why did you leave?
I want my shirt back.
I spent my holiday in Hackone.
Take a look at these documents.
I'd like to translate this to French.
He didn't say a word.
They drink tea in the hall.
Tom fired the engine.
What the hell's wrong with you?
Looks like he was a very good athlete.
Give her some milk.
You're making 300 grams of rice.
Isn't that enough for you?
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Your bike is better than mine.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
Be careful.
How do I get to the airport?
Who pulled it?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
We're boys.
The bad time stopped us from leaving.
Now I'm learning French.
Because I didn't know where to go, I asked the bus driver.
Did you get what I sent you?
I'm so busy.
How did you learn to speak French?
Be there tonight.
You got into the winning series.
I can't be mad at you for that.
The spread of television has significantly reduced us from our time to read.
I'll need forever to explain everything.
Don't push in my closet.
The new coronavirus is very infected.
Every time I'm looking for you, you're gone.
You're going down to the next stop.
Wait a second.
I'm not official here.
Don't look directly at Tom.
Are you sure Tom won't come by 2:30?
Tom taught me to surf.
He doesn't believe in God.
All I want is a cup of coffee and a baked pellet.
I have to fix this.
I made breakfast.
He follows English literature.
The knife's stupid.
She looked at me very much.
It's forbidden to smoke in school buildings.
I'm really tired and I want to go to bed early.
We love you more than anything.
Why did you come so early?
Some people can speak well, others are good listeners.
I didn't understand the last word.
Whatever she's rich, she's not happy.
Go and look yourself.
Have you seen my glasses anywhere?
You can meet him.
Close your books.
I heard someone's coming in.
Tom went on his father's way.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
Tom turned to me in French.
He can speak Russian, too.
Japan has many different characteristics.
Do you believe there's a god?
I'm walking with the dog tonight.
What's your blood group?
Ten houses burned.
I shouldn't have let you do it alone.
Convicted to death.
I only waited five minutes.
Will you show me your photo album, please?
Tom's house burned.
The greatest happiness in life is to love and be loved.
How heavy is your daughter?
Tom shouldn't have done this.
I'm an atheist.
I've never written the words "bosch" and "schie" in German!
I went to the market.
Tom had his knees touched.
I'll come back to the hotel with you.
Give me some milk.
I think she's over 40 years old.
Are you wearing the driver's license?
I don't need your help.
He's in front of the door.
My business is coming back again.
The keys are on the table.
I went to the park.
He reported the police crash.
I don't see him.
Your parents speak French?
I'm afraid you can't talk about a promotion now.
You've always been a little weird.
You're not afraid?
I haven't spoken to anyone today except to Tom.
I can't hear you.
You shouldn't go out.
Can you turn off the light?
He's drinking a medium of coffee.
I'm disappointed he's gone.
You're wearing your socks upside down.
We just got information from Kansas about your brother.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm studying French.
Does this new model have it on the market?
Do you know Mr. Brown?
Don't expect everyone to like you.
What's the matter, actually?
Take care of Tom.
We can't live with 150,000 yen a month.
Obstacle.
She got the ticket without giving anything.
Many people think the retro cars are pretty expensive.
BNP for the third quarter exceeded by 1% of the previous quarter.
I'm sorry, I have to study.
I forgot to tell you what to bring.
Can you even see anything out there?
They were all at work.
I'm out of gas.
Let's ask him.
Where's your father?
I'll do it as you told me to do.
What floor do you live on?
Tom was in my bus.
I waited a month.
I have to go see Tom.
He was forced to sign the contract.
Not as much as the illness hits him.
Aren't you scared, Tom?
God is great!
I just feel terrible.
At the end of the movie, she's very different.
Are you sure you don't want to go to my house?
Go back to your bed.
Tom hasn't eaten yet, did he?
My dog's watching TV too.
Let's go to work.
Are you sure you don't want to come with me?
I'm not crazy.
He's watching TV sometimes.
I need to respect Tom's wishes.
That's pretty extreme.
There's only 30 minutes left until the train leaves.
Participants are preparing for the last round of the competition.
I have plans for Saturday night.
It's like I'm tired.
I hope we'll be in touch soon.
Our coming here was a mistake.
Don't touch us so much.
It's her hobby to collect mailmarks.
I don't understand German.
I think you'll like it there.
I'll be fine.
That's why Tom won't know anything.
Don't forget to bring your kitchen supplies like knives and cooking vessels.
We're here.
Where are you going?
You want to come with us?
I promised myself never to do this again.
Jane runs to school sometimes.
I think you'll like that.
I could make you happy.
Every student has a closet.
Have you seen the coala?
Tom couldn't believe Mary really loved him.
I can't buy you this dress.
I think you panicked.
He went out for a walk.
I hope you're right.
Not less than 100 people attended the meeting.
I know you're right.
My vacation plans failed.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
He came to Tokyo and married her there.
I don't think it's true.
I've lost my idea of the time.
He thought it might be a number.
Basco is the greatest poet.
What's your problem?
I'll visit my grandmother in the hospital.
Hell is a place where it smells bad and nobody loves anyone.
Tom screwed his knee.
Where's the bathroom?
I need to report about this.
You're pretty good with the French, don't you?
He postponed the celebration.
Marie said Tom was her cousin.
They got five butterflies.
Do it for me.
"How are you doing, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
What exactly happened to you?
Get the car in the garage.
Are you sure Tom knows what he's got to do?
I saw his father fight him.
Keep your room clean and clean.
I had a tough night.
She didn't like her husband.
I've been studying his face for scars of exhaustion.
Music is the common language of mankind.
Give her some sugar.
I'll take you home.
I wonder if Tom would teach me French.
It'll be a pleasure to sing for you.
Can you ride a horse?
Tom is very interested in drawing.
Tom's not ready.
Are you alive?
This is Copacabana!
Maybe it's true, but I can't believe it.
I waited as long as I could.
You can't hide from me.
I don't want to be different.
Watch me do it.
We're going to the movies.
He's often going to a movie with her.
You can't smoke in this room.
I heard Tom's membership was discontinued.
I'll be with you if you go and do it.
What's the name of the Boston hotel, where you stayed last year?
It's a complicated problem.
It's exactly 10:00.
It's raining like a brown.
You're an ergenic, too?
He's known as a great poet.
We're not here after 2:30.
I saw Jesse standing there.
I was buying books from the bookshop.
I have to buy one of these.
I like sporting.
He's often late.
I wish I had a friend like you.
I speak French every day at work.
I don't believe in coincidence.
He's nice.
I'm still a little busy.
I just couldn't get Tom to know.
He's one of my neighbors.
We're almost done.
I closed my door.
I could make you happy.
I've never seen anything like this before.
Open the bottle, if you like.
I'm smarter than you.
The latest innovation in medicine is remarkable.
You have to control yourself.
I'm not interested in doing this.
Tom thinks it'll rain.
Can you speak French?
They resigned it as a lost man.
I waited three days.
Material wealth often goes hand by hand with rejection of society.
Did you count the towels?
You need to find a real job.
You two have nothing to do with it.
There are many scientists living in this little village.
I'm sure Tom knows French.
I didn't know we shouldn't do this.
You're a good singer.
The cat's eating.
I used to my parents not to pay attention to me.
Speaking of travel, have you ever been to Australia?
I thought you'd be tired.
I need to see you.
Nancy looks like my sister.
Tom doesn't like mathematics.
He's educating his kids well.
I was just being kind.
Tom's growing tomatoes in his garden.
I like to go fishing.
She gave me access to her records.
Aren't you Tom?
She looks a young man shy.
This is made by Tom.
You can read French, right?
I'm having a lot of sleep.
Be more accurate.
I was a vacation.
No one's gonna know.
Tom's out to drink every night.
The museum is closed today.
She gave me a shirt.
Tom didn't put his belt.
Do you think you're funny?
That's what you decided.
Where's the library?
The boy put all his clothes in the bag.
Bring me the magazines.
She tied him to the chair.
I'm young.
The city's big.
He promised me he wouldn't tell anyone.
Have you owed it yet?
Will you teach me to speak French?
You're cruel.
Tom's still stubborn.
The problem seems much more complicated.
I'm drinking water.
Don't worry.
Tom hasn't been well lately.
I have to tell you something first.
One coffee, please.
I'm a widow.
Did I have another choice?
He's alone.
In China, we put the family first and then the name.
Give it to him.
The boy palely reminded his father of his appearance.
He's always able to write to his mother at least once a week.
He looked me right in the eye.
Don't stop for me.
How do you distinguish them?
Time's on our side.
Do you love your mother?
They've improved their results.
Don't touch them so much.
Where's the boss?
When can we say that a man has alcohol problems?
Is there anyone in the station to meet me?
I haven't heard it in the past few months.
I'm not playing both.
I read an exciting story.
Don't be afraid.
That question I understand somehow.
Why aren't you here?
Tom's the guy who gave me that bike.
We're not going to fire under tyranne pressure.
Tom's a full mystery.
I'm wearing sunglasses.
I don't know why Tom is so angry.
I'm so glad to see you again.
Don't make me stay here.
It's food.
Would you like to drag this over?
Who's your favorite bird?
Everyone but me was invited.
I didn't say that either.
He loves geography and history.
Did you come here on your own?
Do you have any subjects who speak French?
I'm not very good to speak French.
Ask him about the way to the station.
Bill's going for fish a day.
I'm looking for my glasses.
I'm giving up.
My eyes are tired.
The passengers in the bus were fifty.
Tom's working in the wine.
Tom had nothing to do.
Who's listening to Tom?
I think Tom's asleep.
Children often cry because they want to pay attention.
I'm curious.
Please wake me up at 6:00 tomorrow morning.
It makes me feel awkward with her.
We don't want you to feel pressured.
The stafides are dry grapes.
I was in India.
Coffee break is tradition in America.
I told you what I knew.
They have another plan.
Life is full of opportunities.
We were driving when we changed.
If you want anything, don't hesitate to tell me.
Tom wasn't that bad.
I can't find my glasses.
Are you sure you don't want me to wait here with Tom?
You look tired.
He plays baseball after school.
The sound of the horrible screaming made him shake.
Do you have this shirt in black?
It wasn't a celebration.
Amy ordered a new dress.
I've seen you on TV.
Meg's talking too much.
I've taken things off.
I can't believe my eyes.
There's no place to worry.
We have physical.
Did you have fun yesterday?
This sweater is worth over $50.
Just leave it with me.
I don't like doctors.
Tom refused to speak French.
Tom doesn't make Mary wait too long.
Tony didn't know their name.
This is for Tom.
That's where Tom was born.
My car's in the service.
I have an old bike.
Don't you speak English?
Tom won't let you pay.
Sweet your shirts before they get wet.
I'll be there.
Don't get too fast.
How do you know that?
You're a panda.
I just don't want to see you disappointed.
The investment brought him 6%.
Let's have dinner.
I have to get to Tom.
Don't throw them out, then you'll need them.
Who's Tom's girlfriend?
He convinced his mother to give him extra money.
This book was easy.
I fixed his radio.
I took the Highway 58.
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Don't let me die here.
I've never seen you so nervous.
I think we should go.
Untie your blue, please.
I almost forgot it.
Tom can't forget the first time he and Mary had a fight seriously.
You're in danger here.
I'll say I did it.
I don't have anything.
If you need help, don't worry about looking for me.
We managed to get some foreign marks.
I laughed.
It's hard to explain.
We got on a flight to Shinjuku.
The police are investigating the case.
You're drinking from my class.
It was cheaper than I thought.
How's the job going?
I wrote a few songs in French.
Nancy loves music.
The phone is a convenience.
Do you sell French newspapers?
Now the service is yours.
I'll be absent tomorrow.
I want something warm to drink.
Tom went there to learn French.
I haven't said yes yet.
I was barely dealing with the worldfars.
Don't talk to me.
What did you do with your camera?
Tom's very modest.
Thank you for that.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'll contact you as soon as I can.
I want to go to the same school that Tom intends to write.
The situation of the wounded is getting better.
We've got very big Lotus leaves.
We are strongly convinced that when I compose sentences, the author must avoid being subjected to harmful habits presented in using too many unnecessary words, which are actually absolutely excessive in the light of a whole sense.
Tom didn't see you.
Tom said, "Move it," put your way and sit down.
I forgot his name.
Is Bob right?
I need to know.
When's it done?
It gets me out every time I see blood.
Don't!
I thought we could do it by 2:30.
Tom doesn't think Mary looks like her mother.
I've seen Tom do some pretty amazing things.
He didn't get through the test.
Almost all students love English.
God knows what can happen in an hour!
I slept reading a book.
She's late again.
He wasn't that strong.
I'm not a king.
They went through the crowd.
Bring him in.
I doubt Tom's staying.
It's too expensive!
Goodbye!
I think Tom wants to kill himself.
I don't want to sell my soul.
Tom, I have something to tell you.
The police searched the house and found two pounds of heroin.
What color is Tom's dog?
Is this close to your house?
Jane filled a statement.
I could make you happy.
Why is your French so good?
The fools run where the angels are afraid to step.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
I've been at sports all my life.
I'll eat here.
I love tennis.
Do you mind if I come in?
Is it difficult to learn French?
I've waited so long for it to happen.
Come on!
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
I'm so happy.
You don't have to say that when there are kids around.
He's getting easy.
I want to improve my French statement.
You won't believe what I heard.
I'll teach Tom.
Today the train is ten minutes late.
There's been silence.
Are you sure you want to do this?
She didn't like it.
You're learning French, right?
I have to go to a meeting.
I hope we find Tom.
Although I know a little French, I think we should talk English.
She's getting better.
What are you doing on the weekend?
Aren't you nervous?
I need to talk to Tom now.
The drawer's not opening.
Try to calm down.
We need to interview about the test date.
Maybe we're out of the obvious.
Everybody's dying.
Tom's a monk.
I have faith in you.
I'll listen to your advice.
A few days ago, my computer stopped working.
In Japan, almost every family has a washing room.
We're moving to Boston next week.
The Raven flew away.
Will you marry me?
Close your books.
What exactly are you doing, what is the scope of the study, your main interest.
You're trembling.
I'm a little busy.
I thought I'd go and say hello to Tom.
I think Tom's drunk.
I had a lot of heads.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Mark Zuckerberg is an atheist, not believer.
There's a little chance I'm not able to come to the meeting.
He's always congratulated with a gift.
How do I know?
Wouldn't you go?
I think you should see this.
He can read pretty well.
Tom's okay, isn't he?
She stared out for a little while in the newspaper.
J.F. Kennedy was buried in the cemetery in Arlington.
I'm not giving up.
What are you interested in?
I could make you happy.
Carlos climbed the mountain.
He added some sugar in the coffee.
Give me your shirt.
I'm not taking any medicines.
You'll never be alone.
Does he have a big house?
I'm sorry, I don't have much time.
I couldn't understand his ideas.
He knows how to capture his audience.
He'll get to Hacodate tonight.
I'm not a tourist.
A man has to work.
Hello!
They eat apples.
I got her letter yesterday.
I'm very explosive lately. My favorite football team is west.
It was easy to talk to him about the sweet tales.
Tom didn't know what was wrong.
I know you're right.
I need to know what you saw that night.
I've been studying French for three years with a tongue carrier.
This isn't my car.
If we don't go soon, we won't get there until it's light.
Tom's hurt.
His room is a mess.
They take part of their free time to take care of the sick.
Are you sure you don't want to come with you?
I really don't think Tom intends to go.
Ask Tom.
Put the radio on.
I'll stay three more days.
We've delayed our departure for tomorrow.
Nature doesn't know the boundaries.
I'm very happy in Georgia.
I'm busy with things.
I hear you think I'm crazy.
I'm a musician.
I need to find out what the truth is.
If John was here, I wouldn't have had to come.
You better wear a sweater under your jacket.
I thought you'd be tired.
I think you're an idiot.
How complicated is it?
I heard you laugh.
I completely deleted it from my memory.
How can I leave?
You can't go into the museum.
He insisted on his own, even though I told him not to do it.
I didn't want to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom swims very fast.
Add this site to "Preferred".
I have a lot to say about that.
I love my enemies.
I have no idea why.
That's what you're talking about.
The worst thing is, it wasn't always like that.
All the doctor's efforts were in vain, and the man died soon.
I noticed you weren't at your house last night.
It's a threat to us.
You want to buy this sex.
He's a great brain surgeon.
Last month, I was cold.
He can speak French, too.
Are you going?
Let's change the subject.
It was very interesting at school.
They built the library with new books.
I couldn't speak French.
Can I leave now?
Whatever you say, I won't give up.
I've been running french dailys for the last three years.
I'm much bigger than you.
He eats only fruits.
It wasn't that funny.
Either he or I'm wrong.
You're learning French, aren't you?
The girl used to playing only.
I'm playing a group.
The birds were singing.
Tom's finishing at 5:00.
Although Tom went home early today, he's late for work.
I'd rather not speak French.
It was awful, wasn't it?
He looks strong.
You're so good.
It'll come when she'll regret what she said.
Think about it, please.
The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
Did the bus get to the museum?
Is he your teacher?
Be careful with him.
Be careful.
What else do you want me to read?
There's a gold rule: who has gold, he defines the rules.
The house is inhabited by ghosts.
Tom's going to town.
Everything that hasn't been forever aged forever.
You're early again.
Tom married when he was 30 years old.
I helped Tom make his homework.
Can I help you?
You always disagree with your boss.
I bought it for $10.
You don't have to go.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
Did you go to the beach with Tom?
I'm getting shot.
Did you hear Tom speak French?
It's a beautiful sunset, isn't it?
You really speak French pretty well.
Say hello, Jimmy.
I heard what you said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should pick Tom.
Something's going on.
Am I clear?
Many parents are concerned that their children do not get basic knowledge of numbers.
I finished philosophy at my university.
What beach do you like to go to?
You can always give part of the work of the younger servants.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very beautiful girl.
Tom can't do it.
Whatever you do, you can't make a person believe in something, even less yourself.
I don't feel very well.
The air conditioning doesn't work.
You're sitting in my place.
Is there something to scare you?
Everyone agrees with you.
Tom encouraged me to learn French.
I want a MP3 player!
Where's Tom hiding?
I'm shaking when I think about it.
I paid $200 taxes.
I think you should check under the bed.
That won't happen again.
I did it for you.
Stop it or I'll let you understand.
We need Tom's help.
She's atheist.
There's nothing to worry about.
There's something I need to take care of.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another engagement.
When I first met with Tom, he couldn't speak French.
I've seen Tom do what's impossible.
What the hell is that?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
I don't intend to retreat for this clock for a little bit, and let's not talk about breaking up with it finally.
He couldn't get the job.
I think you'll do great.
Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a little longer.
I think we have enough food.
I'll be in the next bus.
Mary made sandwiches with eggs.
What did you see?
I wash every summer every morning.
Put your shirt in the shirt.
Read it again.
If I were you, I wouldn't be so sure.
I think you're crazy.
Unfortunately, I haven't arrived in time for his speech.
I prefer greyfruits in front of the orange.
This place deserves to be visited at least once.
He kept reading the book.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I like this color.
Just accept it.
Her sister fixed her blouse.
I told you that another time, didn't I?
Why do you keep saying there's enough time?
I'll visit you tomorrow.
I don't want your gold or the silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like some orange juice.
From the moment I took your book until I left it, I kept screwing from laughing, and someday I'm going to start reading it.
I tried to argue with Tom.
The Fighter's tightened for a round.
And that's what I've seen.
The dolphin is a kind of dick.
What color are these?
He shakes his son's shoulder.
Tom heard something and wondered what it could be.
Tom asked me to stay.
I don't want to be dragged.
I'm not taking drugs.
I'm dying to see Paris.
At Mother's Day, I gave my mother nineteen flowers.
I think you're absolutely right.
If peace cannot be maintained with honor, it stops to be peace.
She bought the room with beautiful furniture.
Job calculators can be purchased at a pair of socks, and thousands of British children are needed in school, not less than pencil and rubber.
This is the hospital where Tom was born.
You shouldn't wait here.
And Tom, and Mary covered their eyes.
That's my baby.
I'll give you all the information you need.
Stop screwing.
You can't just walk and abuse people.
Don't open those windows.
I'm not insurance.
I'm borrowing money.
She's cooking for college.
I think you're really amazing.
Looks like everything Tom wants is money.
I'm not coming with you.
For the cold time, when you want to drink something hot, I recommend this type of thermos.
Tom runs around like a chicken without a head.
Greece is an ancient country.
A few people visited the meeting.
He was wearing his coat and out of the house.
The new site of Daddeba will run the home "hyper" database "built from the foundations" of the search engine, and will go to the tateebux-OS server with the tattoetal CPU, made entirely by tattobebius.
The old man stopped her.
She hated to call her a coward.
I like it very much.
I've never voted.
Where's the bathroom?
Just go to your room.
I'll be back in time for dinner.
I totally forgot.
She gave me a nice gift.
Are you coming?
Let's meet at 2:30.
The crown is the symbol of the kings.
I don't intend to apologize to Tom.
What are you doing?
I read all Milton's work during my vacation.
What do you recommend?
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you were late.
I'll meet him at the bus stop.
Every student was asked on one question.
Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm really worried about your future.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I've never seen you here before.
It's very hot today.
Don't rush to protect me.
Who's the capital of Greece?
Tom can't speak French, Mary can't speak French either.
I met her for the first time in London.
Can Tom come tomorrow?
Watch where you're going.
They described the girl as a little.
Tom's not used to the city life.
You keep your promise.
I forgot about it.
I think you're putting too much sugar.
Do you like Mexican food?
I'll take you home.
The man is the only animal using fire.
All the flowers in the garden went out.
They made us work all day.
We chose it as president.
No joke?
I've seen these pictures.
If I hadn't noticed, I would have told you.
What's the minimum salary in Luxembourg?
His fate is predetermined.
Are these candles?
If you have to choose between the piano and the violin, what would you choose?
The answer is true.
I think that's great.
Did he go through the test?
Don't let the bus go.
Be careful not to break Tom's heart.
We went there for a week.
That's good.
This kind is threatened.
I think you'd better go to bed.
I like you so much.
I called the bell.
The wolves are moving on the slippers.
Do you have medical insurance?
Watch out, Tom!
The museum's closed on Sunday.
I've been teaching Russian for three years.
We're married to each other.
Tom's not going back.
It'll cost about 10,000 yen.
Tom speaks French as well as Mary.
How hungry are you?
This guy's stable.
I almost won.
It wasn't my fault.
Did you cut the paper?
I don't care what's going to happen.
I've seen you and Tom.
Tom's my friend.
You're approaching this in the wrong way.
Something's going on.
Fill it up.
We have a little chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if it's the same for everyone else.
Are you sure you want to throw it out?
Tom speaks French.
The situation has improved sensitively against what it was.
I played you.
His joke was great.
The police will investigate the crime.
The stories that you will read in this book are dealing with some of the many problems that young people face.
We finally met. I've waited long for this moment.
Can you explain a little bit more?
Am I wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary to hold his hand.
I think we need to examine things.
So we all agree.
If the time allows, I'll go to the museum.
That tie is really good for you.
I think you'll be a great father.
There's no way to contact him.
Never give up.
Would you like to show me this bag?
This is my computer.
Bern is the capital of Switzerland.
You won't believe me.
Can you come in at nine?
Let's synchronize our watches.
I'm shopping every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't do this.
Is this a bribeless store?
I'm looking for a gift for my girlfriend.
And I'd told you, Kell Faido.
That's the camera that Tom made the photos.
Make sure you don't get lost.
I'm tired of changing my plans every time you think you want something else.
It looks like a man from a distance.
We worked hard to tie the two ends.
Good morning.
John's grandmother died after a long illness.
I have to rest.
She said she wouldn't move a inch, no matter who told her.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The defendant was given the right to appeal.
Let's not hurry.
My father went to fish.
They didn't offer me anything to eat.
You don't have to make a quick conclusion.
Don't worry.
He gave up.
The wine is the milk of the adults.
Tom opens the windows every morning as soon as he comes to his office.
I can't work with you if you don't trust me.
That was years ago.
I'm dreaming of nightmares.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
I've seen these pictures.
I'm as strong as you.
I've never been to Europe.
I'm unemployed.
Why don't we take a cab?
I hope I'm not late.
I went home with a train.
Why are you always so angry?
Unfortunately!
Is that why you didn't want to come with me?
Did you decide what you want to order?
I cooked the boy deeply asleep.
She used to call it something.
Are we capable of this?
My sister's name is Patricia.
I should have opened my suitcase.
We discussed whether to cancel the booking.
The kids thought their parents were made of money.
The swimmers were cold.
It's allowed for dogs.
Children are flowers in our life.
I had to cancel the invitation because I was sick.
Tom wouldn't be that stupid.
They hated you, Tom.
Go ahead.
It's a challenge for me, and I'm learning a lot.
Tom was exhausted.
I was counting on her.
Don't look at Tom.
I have to pay for him.
I want to marry you.
Calm down.
That's one of the fish Tom caught.
All right, let's go.
The car's coming.
Looks like we'll be able to make it in time.
Being a troll is art.
I ordered you a beer.
I haven't seen him for about three years.
Let's play baseball.
She's a bodibilder.
The man's eating bread.
He's swimming the river.
You don't remember, and I'll never forget.
I wonder why I'm so tired.
Please congratulate my congratulations to your family.
When someone intermediate sends a message in a bottle, it's just a child's fantasy. When Christopher Columbus sent a message in a bottle, the fate of the entire country is placed on a map.
Are you sure you don't want to help me?
I'm sorry I made you so much trouble.
Kids play dodgeball.
It's snowing.
I want you to clean up your room.
I tried to be human.
What's the plan, Tom?
Thank you very much for your cooperation.
Let's not talk about it anymore.
Her condition continued to improve.
Does Tom really want me to go to his party?
I'm not tired at all.
