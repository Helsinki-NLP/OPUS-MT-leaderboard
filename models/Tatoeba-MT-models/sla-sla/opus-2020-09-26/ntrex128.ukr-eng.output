The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned about being “communicated with the Maps ”
Some of the CHAs are frightened by the recommendation to change the name of their post at the ‘ Member of Parliament of Wales’ (MWP).
This recommendation appeared because of the plans to change the name of the Assembly to "Parlament Wales".
The entire political spectrum is concerned that this can cause ridiculous.
One CHA from the leuborists stated that his group was disturbed by the Rome of Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in the Whelsh twp, it means "innown" and "pwp" means a defecation act.
CHA from the Wales Party stated that his group was “not satisfied ” and offered alternatives.
One of the Wheels conservators said that his group was "unpartial" about the change of the name, but noted that the MWP could quickly become a map.
In this context, the word of the welsh letter "w" is similar to the yorkshire English phrase of the letter "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing the legislation for the change of names, noted: “The remaining decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be taken by the members themselves.”
The Wales Law of Self - Self - Control from 2017 gives Wales the Assembly the right to change his name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public discussion of proposals, and the rename of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales received wide support.
As regards how to call the CHA, the Commission suggests that they be called “the members of the Parliament of Wales, WMP, but the MWP option has received the greatest public support.
CHA, of course, offers alternatives, but the attempt to reach agreement may cause problems to the head of Elin Jones, who should submit a draft change law for several weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the work of the Assembly, including the rules of disposal of the CHA and the structure of the committee system.
CHA will make a final vote on its new name when discussing legislation.
Macedonians are going to vote for a referendum about the change of the country’s name
On Sunday, the voters vote whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The voting was organized to resolve a multiannual dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens have long claimed that the name of their north neighbor is a claim in Greece, and have repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonia’s president George Ivanov, who opposed the conduct of a referendum on the change of the name, stated that he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, referendum members, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of the name is just a price to pay for the EU and NATO entry.
St. Martin's calls are silent because Harlem's churches are overcome difficult times
“ Old people I had been talking to, ” says Mr. Adams, “there used to be a bar and a church on every corner. ”
There is none of them now."
He believes that bars disappear.
"Now people are socializing differently.
The bars are no longer such a local living room where they regularly enter."
As for churches, Adams fears that money from the sale of assets is not enough as long as the leaders expect, and “they will be found where they started. ”
The churches, he added, can replace houses with condoms, and there will be people who will not help the holidays that remain close.
“ The majority of people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white, ” explained Adams, “this will accelerate the day when all of these churches are closing up, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to condominiums will become their households. ”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolitan: the Metropolitan community church was built in 1870, and Saint Marchen — ten years after it.
The indigenous white methodist community left in the 1930s.
The black community held the rituals nearby received the right of property to a building.
Saint-Marthen moved to the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of small traders on the 125th Street, the main Harlem Trade Street, and these traders didn't want to take the black people to work and to increase them in service.
In 1939 the fire damaged the building, but Johnson’s father’s paraphies wanted to rebuild it and set a carilion.
Reverend David Johnson, son and heir of father Johnson in Saint Marthen, proudly called the carilion “poor bells. ”
The expert who played a carilion in July called it a different way: “cultural treasure ” and“ unreplaced historical instrument.”
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first carilion in the world on which a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who had taken the bigger carilion in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merrivezer, there was no replacement in St. Marthen.
What happens in St. Marthen over the past few months is a complicated story about architects and contractors.
The Council, the governing body of parish, which consists of the leaders of the Peace, wrote in July that it is concerned that the eligibility will “contribute the expenses” of the Council, while the council did not participate in the rental of architects and contractors sent by the eligibility.
Some of the paraphies complained of the lack of transparency by the eparchy.
The shark injured a 13-year-old boy who sneaked after the lobsters in California.
According to officials, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday and traumad him, and the boy sneezed the lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season.
The attack took place at approximately 7 a.m. near the Beacon beach in Encinites.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego that on Saturday morning he swimmed around half an hour with his friends when he heard the boy calls for help, and with the group he swimmed to him to get out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought that it was just an appreciation for a captured lobster, but then realized that the boy shouted: “I was bitten!
I was tasted!"
As soon as he reached the boy, he saw that his key was completely broken.
“I shouted all of them to go out of the water, “In the water of the shark! ”
The boy was delivered to the Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he's in critical state.
The shark's type of attack is unknown.
The savior captain Larry Giles on the media briefing told me that a few weeks ago a shark was noticed in this area, but it was established that it was not related to dangerous sharks.
Giles added that the victim had been injured by the upper part of the tulub.
For the purposes of investigation and security, the authorities closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swama in Encinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to go to the British cosmetic market
Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams using cosmetic islands like those in universities. Work on islands will be qualified sellers.
In the context of an increased exit to the British cosmetic market, 2,8 billion pounds of sterlings (continued to grow while the volume of sales of clothes and goods for the house is declined) increased islands with cosmetics will be tested in 11 shops throughout the country. In the next year, if the idea is successful, the islands will appear in other shops.
Investments in cosmetics are linked to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways of using a politics space used earlier under TVs, microwave caves, and goods for home.
Sainsbury's claimed that they would double the cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 goods, including the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
There's an existing L'Oreal, maylline and Burt's Bees will get more space: brand zones like those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also updates Boutique’s cosmetic assortment: Now most of the products presented will not be tested on animals, which young buyers are increasingly demanding.
Furthermore, the fragrance Shop parchment seller protests his trays in two Sainsbury's stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, North London, last week, and the second will be opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and transition to shopping small food volumes every day in small shops forces supermarkets to make additional efforts to involve visitors.
Mike Coope, Executive Director Sainsbury's, said that their shops would be more like univergages, because the supermarket network is trying to resist Aldi and Lidl's discs with a larger number of services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's opening Argos departments in hundreds of their shops, also opened a number of Habitats departments. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and claimed that it increased the sale of food goods and made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt to update cosmetics and pharmaceutical products has failed.
Sainsbury's tested collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute about how to divide revenues from adolescents in supermarkets.
The new strategy appeared after Sainsbury's sold their pharmaceutical business (281 pharmacy) Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, for 125 million pounds of sterlings three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help to add a expanded luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hix, a commercial director of Sainsbury, said: “We have changed the appearance of our islands with cosmetics to make the atmosphere more pleasant for buyers.
We also invested in specially trained consultants who could give advice.
The brands we have represented are called to meet any needs, and the pleasant environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is a competition for the old way of buying."
Peter Jones's "defeated" because Holly Willowby had an agreement worth 11 million pounds of steerlings
The star of the Dragon Lygwo, Peter Jones, is a "distributioner" because the television leader Holly Willowby came out of an agreement with his brand of life-to-living goods (the value of the contract is 11 million pounds of sterlings) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for a brand of household clothing and accelerators True.
The couple's business was linked to the Goop Guinet Peltrow brand.
The 37-year-old leading program this morning announced its entry to Instagram.
Holly Willowby led Peter Jones’s "Ligh Dragon" star to the story when at the last moment he left their profitable business of life products to focus on the new profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources are reported that Jones's "defeaters" when the golden girl from the TV confessed during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the Jones Empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts are worth 1,5 million pounds of sterlings, means she has no time to devote to its common brand of household clothing and accessors of Truly.
This business was linked to the Goop Guinet Peltrow brand and had to double Willowby's wealth, which was estimated in 11 million pounds of sterlings.
When 37-year-old Willowby told Instagram that he was coming from Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was no doubt Holly’s primary priority.
He had to become a long - term future for the next few decades.
Willowby's decision to get out of business shocked all the stakeholders.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, almost before the launch.
In the headquarters in Marlow's full set of things ready to sell.
Experts believe that the entry of the leading This Morning, one of the most highly paid stars of Britain, could cost the company millions because of large investment in goods (from the pillows and candles to clothing and household clothes) and create further delays with the launch.
This may also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willowby and her husband Dan Boldwin were close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby and Capp created True in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as head of the government in March.
The couples held the holidays together, Jones owns 40 percent of Balduin’s company’s shareholders.
Willoughby will be the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Anthony Mcpartlyn as the leading I'm A Celebry of ITV.
The source near Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his matters.”
Hard conversation, "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticism that he received from the news media for a comment that someone would be considered "nepresidency" as well as a very positive attitude to the leader of North Korea.
“Why did President Tramp take such great actions? ”
said Tramp by imitating the voice of the leading news. —
I did not do anything."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Tramp called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step to the danuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks went into a deaf corner.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the leading diplomat of North Korea Ri Yong Ho told the world’s leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see the “reasonable” response from the United States to its first disarmament steps.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues the sanctions to support pressure.
Tramp was a much more optimistic talk at his mything.
“ We have a good relationship with North Korea, ” he said.
We were going to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have such beautiful relations."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim had positive results: the end of missile trials, the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of American military workers home.
He also protected his unusual approach when he talked about Kim’s relationship.
"It's so easy to behave as president, but instead of 10,000 people on the streets trying to get into this battle loaded stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there," Tramp said, pointing the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
Especially after the earthquake on Lomboc, foreign non -governmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lomboka’s population have suffered, the national disaster has not been declared, and this is a pre-convention for international assistance.
“ In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they were not approaching international assistance, so it is a little complicated, ” said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although “Saving the Children ” is gathering a team to travel to Palo, as far as we don’t know if a foreign personnel can work in place.
Mr. Sutopo, a representative of the National Agency for Disaster Effects, stated that the Indonesian authorities evaluate the situation in Palo to determine whether to allow international organizations to assist.

Apparently, the absence of a siren’s warning about tsunami in Palo, although the warning was likely active, contributed to death.
To move between the abundance of Indonesian islands not just in the best times.
Scientific disasters make logistics more complicated.
The medical ship in Lomboc for the treatment of the victims of the earthquake is flying to Palo, but it will be possible to reach the location of a new disaster in at least three days.
President Joco Vidodo has improved Indonésia’s infrastructure as a basis for its election campaign and increased the cost of roads and railways.
But the financing deficit created problems for Mr. Jocco's administration, who plans to change the next year.
Mr. Joco also disturbs the continuing interfaith enemy in those parts of Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has chosen a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died, tens of thousands displaced from their homes as a result of opposition to Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets with the use of machete, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

Cromwell's statue next to Parliament becomes a new monument that suffers from the "prescribement of history"
The skipping of the statue would be an earning payment for the destruction in the Taliban style of many cultural and religious artifacts of England, which his fanatic puritani followers did.
But the Communities of Cromwell called Mr. Creek's proposal "fuzzy" and "the attempt to overwrite history".
John Goldsmith, head of the Communities of Cromwell, said: “In view of the current debate on the withdrawal of statues, the statue of Oliver Cromwell near the Westminster Palace was inevitable.”
Iconism during English civil wars was not carried out by Cromwell or by his command.
Cromwell is likely to be sacrificed in an independence for the actions of his precedent Thomas in the previous century.
The great statue of the Cromwell Sculptor William Hamo Thornecroft is a testimony of the mood of the 19th century and a part of the history of the character that many thinks is still worth honoring.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Well, many who are probably more at the end of the 19th century than now, consider Cromwell a parliamentary defender from external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether such a concept is completely accurate, the subject of historical debate that lasts.
There is no doubt that the middle of the 17th century conflict has identified the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the famous figures that represent one side of this conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and honoring."

More than 20 million people have been watching the hearing of Brett Cavano
On Thursday, over 20 million people in six television networks observed the exciting testimony of a candidate at the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano and Christine Blaze Ford, who accused him of sexual violence, which appeared to have happened in the 1980s.
Political opposition continued, the channels interrupted the planned programs to report about the last Friday news: the agreement prepared by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake about the FBI's one-week investigation on the charge.
Ford informed the Senatus Court Committee that she was 100% sure that Cavano was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at the high school party.
Cavano in his emotional testimony said that he was 100 percent convinced that it was not.
It's quite likely that more than 20.4 million people were observed on Friday, as reported by the research company Nelsen.
The company calculated the average CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Could not get numbers immediately on other networks that also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In Nelsen, also, there are problems with measuring the number of people watching television in offices.
In comparison, audience like the audience that watches the playoff series or the Oscar prize.
The Fox News Channel, whose leaders of thoughts were strongly supported by Cavano’s assignment, was the leader of all the channels during the all-day hearing, with an average of 5,69 million viewers, noted in Nelsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to representatives of Nelsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, in NBC — 2.94 million, in MSNBC — 2.89 million, in CNN — 2.2 million.
Interest remained high after hearing.
Flake became the central figure of the Friday Drama.
The office of this moderate republican published a statement that he would vote for Cavano, and then Friday morning CNN and CBS camera fixed as protesters screamed at Flake when he tried to go on elevator to hear the Court Committee.
He was standing with a few minutes scratched by his eyes, which was broken directly on CNN.
“ I stand right in front of you, ” said one woman.
You think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power, and a lot of women are powerless."
Flake reported that his office published a statement, and before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more at the hearing of the committee.
All cable and broad - language channels have been directly transmitting hours later, when the Court Committee had to vote on the promotion of Cavano’s candidate to the Senate in full.
Flake said he would do it only if he knew that the FBI would consider the charges against the candidate next week, what the democratic minority requires.
Flake partially convinced the conversations with his friend, the senator of Democratic Chris Kunz.
After talking to Kuns and then a few other senators, Flake made a decision.
The choice of Flake had an impact, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have votes to appoint Cavano’s candidacy without investigation.
President Tramp initiated the FBI investigation on the charges against Cavano.

68-year-old Narciss Termes, a electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope that Catalonia could get independence anymore.
“ Last year we survived one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry from joy that could vote, but now we went into a deaf corner," he said.
Despite the victory of life, but very complex in the regional elections in December last year, the catalan parties acting for independence failed to save the impulse this year, because many of their most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or prison in expecting their participation in the referendum organisation and further declaration of independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took up a protest on the police on the phone, stated that the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
“ The tension is increasing, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine catalonic leaders, who are in the following isolator since the end of the year, announced that next year he would be speaking to the European Parliament.
"The candidate status at European elections is the best way to condemn the receipt of democratic values and reprisals that we see from the Spanish government," he said.
The men were arrested after the car got into the house.
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the car got into a house in Londonderr's several times.
The incident happened at Ballinagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 after British standard time.
Detective Bob Blammings noted that the gate was damaged and the house itself.
It is quite possible that at some point the car was shot out of the arbalet.
Mengi's hit has provided Levingstone victory over Rangers with account 1-0
The first gol of Dolly Menga in the Livingstone composition has become a victory
The elevated Levingstone class surprised the Rangers and brought Steven Gerard the second defeat of 18 games as an IBROX Club manager.
The blow of Dolly Menga turned out to be decisive: Gary Holt's team risen at one level of Hybernian in a second.
Gerard's team has not won any victory in the departure of the Premier League of this season, and next Sunday he'll play with the Hurts leaders, and it's off to eight points.
Before that, on Thursday, Rangers will be adopted by the Rapid Vienna within the League of Europe.
Meanwhile, Levingstone continues its invincible move to six games in the division, and the chief coach Holt has not been defeated after he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
The Levingston is missing the chances that give the uncomfortable guests.
Holt's team was supposed to be ahead a long time before they killed because their clarity creates all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but made a hit along the gates, then Alan Lithow broke through the gate after he collapsed and accepted the attack of Craig Halket along the gates that he made his head.
The masters were satisfied that they allowed Rangers to play before them, and they knew that they could cause problems to guests from standard positions.
So it was a decisive goal.
The Rangers missed a free strike, and Levingston made opening, and Declan Gallacher and Robinson acted by Menga, who took the ball and killed from the center of the fine.
Until that stage, the Rangers were dominated by the ball, but the defense of the masters of the field proved to be inconvenient, and the gateman of Liam Kelly was not mostly disturbed.
This trend continued in the second time, although Alfredo Morelos was able to hit Kelly’s direction.
Scott Pittman's strike reflected with the legs of the Rangers, Allan McGregor. Litgow hit the gate in another standard combination of Levingstone.
The navists flyed to the Levingstone Penalty and constantly neutralized, and two requests on the toolbar — after the Halket attack on Glenn Middleton, who came in exchange, and the game of hand — were rejected.
Levingstone phenomenon: Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the stadium Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal game and the result of Levingstone.
Everybody played great to one, they continued to exceed the expectations on this eastern trajectory.
Their style of the game and the storage has almost not changed after returning to the highest level, but it should be given Holt the right way he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played great, very well organized the defense, and Meng forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to keep watching.
Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under Gerard’s leadership, but now they do not reach much of these standards.
They didn't have the last ball -- only once they broke the defense of the masters of the field -- and it was like a waking for the Rangers, which was found in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was unanimously accepted in Kelnee
Saturday (29 September), when Turkish and Germany leaders met in Berlin, smiles and blue sky were seen.
This is the last day of the contradictory visit of President Erdogan to Germany in order to restore the relationship between NATO allies.
There were some disputes between them about human rights, freedom of press and the introduction of Turkey to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Kelne to open a huge new mosque.
The most Turkish population lives in the city outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police didn't let 25,000 people gather in front of the machete, but a lot of president's supporters came closer to see him.
Thousands of protestors against Erdogan — among them many Kurds — have also forced themselves to hear, condemning the politics of Erdogan and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
The bilateral protests indicate the unequivocality of a guest, which some German Turks have called hero, while others are dictators.

Six prison workers were injured as a result of rushing in a man's regime prison, said the Prison Administration.
Her Majesty's prisons in Long-Lartin in Woostershire started about 9:30 after the British standard time Sunday still lasts.
In order to stop the disturbance, eight prisoners initiated and localized in one wing, a special Tornado division was called.
The officers were given medical assistance in connection with the light injuries of the faces that were received at the scene of the event.
The representative of the Prison Service commented: “To solve the incident that continues in prison of Her Majesty Long-Lartin, specially prepared prison personnel was involved.

In October last year, the police forced the police to stop serious disturbances that attacked prisoners with billard layers
Uragan Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flood floods.
Tropical depression rarely hits Arizona, but this may happen at the beginning of the next week, since the remains of the hurricane Rosa are going across the southwest of the desert, creating the risk of flood floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings about flood floods on Monday and Tuesday in the west Arizona to south and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and Monday night will rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that only ten tropical cycles had stopped the status of tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) from Phoenix since 1950,
and Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) from the Arizona border.
According to the recent predictions of the National Centre of Hurricane, Mogolon-Rome area in Arizona is 5.08 to 10.16 inches and places up to 15.24 inches of decline.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Pool, are likely to get from 2,54 to 5.08 inches of decline, perhaps 10.16 inches.
Where there is no risk of floods, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing, since the region suffers from drought.
Although the floods are a very serious problem, some of these floods are likely to be useful because the southern west is now under drought.
According to the American Drought Monitoring Centre, a little more than 40 percent of Arizona’s territories suffer from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest drought category, reports the weather.com.
First of all, the way of hurricane Rosa leads to slides on the Mexican Peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, on Sunday morning, still in the hurricane with the maximum wind speed of 137 km an hour, is 620 km south of Punta-Eugene, Mexico, and moves north at 19.3 km per hour.
The storm faces more cold water in the Pacific, so it weakens.
Thus, the tropical storm is expected to cause a hurricane in Mexico on the day or evening of Monday.
The number of declines in some parts of Mexico may be significant, which creates a significant risk of floods.
“The total amount of declines from Low California to Northwest Sonora is expected to be between 7.62 and 15.24 cm, places possibly up to 25.4 cm,” reports the weather.com.
Rosa will then go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the border of Arizona early in the morning as a tropical depression that will continue to go through Arizona and later at the evening the south of Utah will reach Tuesday.
“ The basic danger they expect from Rosa or her remains is a very strong rain in the Low California, Northwest Sonora, and southwest of the US desert, ” reports the National Centre of Hurricane.
These rains are expected to lead to the life - threatening floods and streams of trash in deserts, as well as to move in the mountains.

Tramp says that Cavano “tolerated anger and anger” of the Democratic Party
"The voting for Judge Cavano is a voice against the ruthless and disgusting tactics of the Democratic Party," said Tramp at the miting in Wiling, West Virginia.
Tramp said that Cavano “tolerated anger and anger” of the Democratic Party during the entire process of deployment.
Cavano witnessed before the Congress on Thursday, unselfishly and emotionally denying the accusations of Christine Blazey Ford that he committed sexual violence over it a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed the hearing of her accusations.
On Saturday, the president stated that that day “the American people saw brilliance, nature and courage. ”
“The voting by Judge Cavano is a voice for one of the most trusted lawyers of our time, a lawyer with an infinite experience in the state service, ” he said to the crowd of members in the West Virginia.
The president mentioned Cavano’s expulsion when he spoke of the importance of the Republicans’ phenomenon at the medium-term elections.
"After five weeks, one of the most important choices in our life will take place.
I'm not running, but I'm really running, ” he said. —
That's why I'm fighting for wonderful candidates everywhere."
Tramp claimed that the democratic mission was to “confront and stop. ”
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Cavanaugh candidature will take place not later Friday, said CNN associate one of the Republicans' leaders.
Thousands of people died of earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number of victims grows
At least 384 people were killed, many were misty in the ocean when the giant waves crashed on the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indian island of Sulaves, stated the government of the country on Saturday.
A hundred people rested on the beach festival in Palo on Friday, when the waves were six feet (18 feet) high in the darkness, slaining many to death and destroying everything on their way.
Tsunami took place after the earthquake of 7,5 points.
“When there was a tsunami threat yesterday, people were still engaged in their business on the beach and not immediately started running, and they became victims, ” said the briefing at Jacquarty Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, representative of the Indonesian agency for the elimination of the consequences of disasters (BNPB).
"It wasn't just tsunami, it was moving cars, trees, houses, it hit all that was on the land," Nugrocho said, added that before hitting the coast line, tsunami went through the open sea with 800 miles/hour (497 miles/hour).
In order to get rid of tsunami, some people climbed on trees and survived, he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palo.
In the aerophotos released by the disasters agency, many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are turned and destroyed, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
The shores in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes felt in a area where 2,4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Agency for Evaluation and Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy released as a result of a strong earthquake on Friday was 200 times bigger than the energy of the nuclear bomb thrown on Hirosim during World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could contribute to the force of tsunami, stated the agency.
Nugrocho referred to the loss of “wide - place” and noted that thousands of houses, hospitals, trade centres and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found under the fractures of destroyed buildings, he said that 540 people were wounded and 29 were missing without message.
Nugrocho noted that the victims and damages may be more than 300 miles (90 miles) along the coast line north of Palo, a region called Donghala, near the epicentre of the earthquake.
"The communication lines have been completely damaged, and we have not received any information from Donghala," said Nugrocho.
More than 300 000 people live there, says the Red Cross statement, and his staff and volunteers have moved to the affected areas.
“ This is a tragedy, but it can become much bigger, ” says the report.
On Saturday, the agency received a broad criticism for noticing that the tsunami hit Palo, although officials said that the waves came at the time indicated in the warning.
In the amateur’s videos that people shared in social networks, the man on the upper floor of the house is exclaiming a frequent warning about the approach of tsunami to people on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, the wall of water hit the shore, taking the buildings and the cars.
Reuters failed to verify the reality of the frames immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a serious deactivation of electricity, which ripped the connection around Pala, which has complicated the coordination of the rescue.
The military service began sending trucks with the help of Jacarda and other cities, the authorities reported, but the evacuated people still need food and other objects of the first need.
The city airport was only opened for help, and it would be closed until October.
President Joco Widdo was to visit the evacuation centres in Palo on Sunday.
The number of deaths of tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
That's very bad.
The workers of the World Vision Organization from Donghala have well reached the city of Palo, where they are hiding in the brezent tantas established at the court of their office, but on the way they saw the desolation scenes, said Mr. Doseba.
“ They told me that they saw many ruined houses, ” he said.
That's very bad.
Even when the aid groups began decisive action to eliminate the consequences of the disaster, some complained that foreign humanitarian aid workers with great experience did not allow to go to Palo.
According to the Indonesian rules, financing, supply and provision of personnel from abroad can only start if the scene of disaster is declared as a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“ This is still a disaster at the province level, ” said Aulia Ariani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but this status is not yet given."
The second night after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami, the friends and families of those who have not yet been found still hoped that the appearance of their loved ones would become a miracle that would decorate these dark stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy got out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescue officers got a woman laying under stone two days along with her mother’s body next to her.
Hendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian National Team of Paraplanerism, trained two missing paraplanerists to participate in the Asian games that were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paraplanteers who were trapped in the Roa Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his disciples.
“ As an elder in paraplanerism, I have my emotional burden, ” he said.
Mr. Gendon tells us how a few hours after the news about the ruining of Roa Roa Roa, who spread among the paraplanterist community, he desperately sent a message on whatsApp to the rivals of Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one gray slipper, not with double blue gallons.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves took $26,750 while filling a bankomat in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, the thief stole 26,750 dollars from Brink, who charged a banknote in Newport on the Levee, reports the Newport Police Department.
The car driver was emptying the bankomat in the entertainment complex and was preparing to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the newspaper.
As long as he was busy, another man “run back to Brink's colleague ” and stole the bag of money for filling.
The Witnesses noticed a number of suspects who fled the crime scene, but the police did not indicate the number of incidents.
Anyone who has information about these people should contact the Newport police by number 859-292-3680.
Canyo West: Reper changes his name to Y
Reper Canye West changes his name to Y.
On Saturday, declaring a change in Twitter, he wrote: “Pretty officially known as Canye West.”
41-year-old West was called Ye for a while, and he used this shortcut as a name for his album released in June.
A change happened before his appearance at the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to introduce his new Yandhi album.
At the show, he replaces the singing of Ariana Grande, who canceled her part for "emotional reasons," said the author of the show.
This is not just a shortening of the current professional name, but before West said that this word had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe it's the most common word in the Bible, and the Bible means "you"," said West at the beginning of this year, discussing his name of the album with a radio guide Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
Canya, which means "one," was cut down to just "Y" -- it's just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
Album is more reflection of what we are."
Canya is one of the few famous rapers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Paff Deddy, P. Deedy and Grandpa, announced this year that he chose the names of Lav and Braser Lav.
Westa's former colleague, J. Z.I., also experimented with deficit and large letters.
President of Mexico Andreas Manuel Lopez Obrador promises not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected President of Mexico, Andreus Manuel Lopez, promised never to use the army against civilians, and soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of bloody debate over students.
On Saturday at the Tlatelolko Square, Lopez Obabrador promised “no one to use the army to suspense the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, the military fired a peaceful demonstration on the square by killing about 300 people, while the left student movements began to be established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Abraham promised to support young Mexicans, providing monthly subsidies to the students and opening more free state universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education lead young people to criminal groups.
United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
Since China increases in artificial intellectual activity, the United States should double the amount they spend in research in this field, the investor and practice in SHI Cai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were made after the various parts of the US government made statements about S.I., although there is no formal strategy in the S.I.A.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: he wants to become number 1 on innovation in the S.I. by 2030.
“Double budget for S.I.I. research would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far away from the United States, and we are preparing for the next breakdown in the S.I.,” said Lee.
The double funding could double the probability of the next big achievement in the S.I. will be made in the United States, Lee said in the CNBC interview this week.
Lee, whose book S.I.A.: China, Silicon Valley and a new world order was printed this month, is the general director of the Sinovation Ventures Fund, who invested in Face++, one of the most famous S.I.C. companies in China.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he was working on the S.I.I. system that played the best American player in Othello, and later he was the executive director of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee marked the previous competitions from the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Agency for Final Defence Research Projects (DARPA), and asked when will be the next to help identify the next perspective participants.
The U.S. researchers often need to work hard to win government funds, says Lee.
“This is not China's academic leaders, it's corporations,” he said.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have recently hired S.I.A. lights from the universities.
According to Lee, change in immigration policy can also help the United States to increase the efforts in the SIE.
"I think the Green Card should be automatically offered to S.I. candidates," he said.
The State Council of China published its Artificial Intellectual Plan in July 2017.
The National Fund for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to persons working in academic institutions, just as the National Science Fund and other US government organizations are giving money to American researchers, while the quality of academic work in China below, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defence Ministry created the Common Centre for Artificial Intellectual Intelligence, which aims to involve industrial and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Intelligence Committee.
Also this month, the DARPA announced the investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
With regard to the National Scientific Fund, now he's investing more than 100 million dollars a year in the S.I.I.
In the meantime, the U.S. legislative authority, who wanted to create the National Security Commission of Artificial Intelligence, has not made any steps for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on the change of the country’s name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday's referendum on whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia, allowing to resolve a multiannual dispute with Greece, which blocked Macedonia from the possibility of membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of the north neighbor is a claim in its territory, and put veto on the introduction of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments made an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the agreement claim that this change would compromise the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote in a referendum, and a boycot campaign would raise doubts whether the voters of the minimum 50% would reach the phenomenon, which would allow the referendum to be considered to be valid.
The question in the referendum's bulletin is: "You support NATO and the EU membership under the conditions of acceptance of an agreement with Greece?"
The applicants of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, claim that this is the price of Macedonia, one of the countries formed after the decline of Yugoslavia, is worth paying for the introduction of EU and NATO bodies.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for Macedonian youths, so that she could live free under the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the outcome of the vote is not legal, enough members of the parliament claimed that they would support it to make it decisive.
Two-third votes in the parliament will be required to change the name.
The State Electoral Commission stated that there were no violations until 13:00.
However, the phenomenon was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the latest parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters were thrown into the urna of their bulletins.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old elector Goze Tanevski in the capital of Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Macedonia, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zrika and his son Duško voted in a referendum on the change of the name of the country, which would open the way to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Volodimir Cavardarkov prepared a small scene and set up chairs in front of tents organized by those who would fight the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proudly raised head, not through the service door," said Cavardarkov.
We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can contact others, such as China and Russia, and become part of European and Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zeev believes that NATO membership will bring many necessary investments to Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20%.
"I believe that the largest majority votes for, because more than 80% of our citizens are speaking for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He pointed out that the result “yes ” would be a confirmation of their future.
According to an examination published by the Institute of Political Research in Macedonia last Monday, the referendum will take part from 30 to 43 percent of the voters, which is below the necessary phenomenon.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian television channel Telma, 57 percent of respondents are planned to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote for.
In order to recognise the referendum to be valid, the phenomenon must be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat in the referendum will be the first serious strike in the Western government's policy since the beginning of its work in May last year.
See: Serhio Aguero from Manchester City is going through the entire Brayton defense and killing the gol
Serhio Aguero and Rahim Sterling have passed the Brayton defense and have won the Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's hall at 65th minute, the match looked ridiculous simple.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between the three Brayton Protectors and found himself in the open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four green ones.
He circled by one defender, then circled a few more on the edge of the Brighton penalty.
Then he made a pass left by seeing Sterling.
The English Forward made the first touch on the penalty to give Aguero's ball, which with his right bottom launched it to the right part of the gate, by defeating the Bryton golkepper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some problems with his legs," said the journalists, "Sitty Manager, Pep Guardiola.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky that he stuck the goal at this point."
But the original advantage of the sky-blue in this Prime Minister's League game was provided by Sterling.
This goal took place for 29 minutes.
Aguero got a ball deep in the area of Bryton.
He sent a beautiful invading pass along the left flag of Leroy Sune.
Leroy made a few touches and then made a pass to Sterling in the direction of a remote stamp.
The Forward of the Sky-Blue threw the ball into the gate just before he slipped out.
"Siti" will meet Haffenheim at the group stage of the League of Championships at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rain Neckcar-Aren stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Shercer wants to take the scores from Roxis.
Since the Washington Nashonals team came out of the playoff, there were no significant reasons to wait for another start.
But Shercer's tendency to compete is expecting to go to the Pitcher Mountain on Sunday in a fight against Colorado Rokis, provided that Roxis will still have difficulties with playoffs. Now, Rockis is on one game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West.
"Roxis" at least have Wild Cards for winning 5-2 over "Nashionals" on Friday night, but they still want to reinforce the title of the first division.
"Although we play for nothing, at least we can abandon the ball, knowing how the watchers are doing here in Denver, and another team will probably play at the highest level I've seen all this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this racing?
The Nashionals will still announce who will be the starting pitcher on Sunday, but it is reported that they are inclined to be Shercer.
Shercer, for which this will be 34th start, took a pitching session on Thursday, and he could play Sunday, his usually weekend.
The Washington right has the result of 18-7 out of 2.3 ERA and 300 strike cars in 220 2/3 inning in this season.
Tramp Mytings in Western Virginia
The president mentioned the situation around his candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano, when he spoke of the importance of the Republicans’ advocacy at the medium-term elections.
“All that we have done will be placed on the map in November.
Five weeks later, there will be one of the most important choices in our life.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm really running, so I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere I can," he said.
Tramp continued: “You see this horrible, terrible, radical group of democrats, you see that this happens now.
And they're firmly enthusiasmed to restore power, using any means, you can see the deception, the creepy.
They don't care who suffers from them, who needs to be transgressed in order to receive power and control, they want powers and control, we are not going to give them."
The mission of democrats, he said, "confront and stop."
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "the wicked and wicked, the disgusting and the liar."
He mentioned the Senate Court Committee, named the Democratic Senator Diane Finstein by the name, which caused the audience to the noise of dissatisfaction.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you file a document?
Uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm expecting -- it was really a bad body movement language -- the worst language of the body movements I've ever seen."
The Laborist Party is no longer a wide church.
It is not tolerable to those who express their views.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, it was almost not surprised.
Finally, I'm the last of those members of Parliament that they've been told that they're unhappy, and that's all because we're expressing our opinion.
My colleague on the parliament, Joan Ryan, acted almost the same way because she decisively acted against antisemitism.
I was convicted for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
As regards the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, about Europe, these questions are ironicly similar to those that Jeremiah did not agree with previous leaders.
The report on the meeting of the Nottingham East on Friday says: "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the Friday Friday meetings of the General Committee for my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Laborists were just like that.
Unfortunately, today many meetings have a very different tone, and the promise of a “greater, more soft ” policy has been forgotten for a long time if it was ever started to be done.
It becomes more obvious that the Layborist Party does not allow different views, and every idea is evaluated from the position of whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and my colleagues, as I used to think, had similar political views, began expecting me to turn around 180 degrees and accept the positions that I would never agree, whether national security or the only EU market.
Whenever I speak publicly -- and it doesn't matter what I'm saying -- it follows the type of attacks in social networks with calls for revocation, the condemnation of the center policy, they tell me that I should not be at the Layborist Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I have been lucky more than some of my colleagues, since the comments I have directed are usually political.
I am excited of professionalism and the determination of the colleagues who face sexist or racist attacks daily, but they never refuse.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse levels have become a standard.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Layborist Party should raise a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a wide church, and with every movement of untrustedness or changing the rules of selection, the party is steady.
For the past two years, I received a lot of advice, and I was encouraged not to move, not to speak so loudly that “everything was good. ”
But that's not why I came to politics.
I joined the layborists 32 years ago as a school student, because because of the lack of attention from the government, Tatcher, my class in high school has literally broken down, since I am trying to improve the quality of public services for those who need them most, whether the local advisor or the minister of the government.
I never hid my policy, including in the last elections.
No one at Nottingham East was distracted by my political views and disagreements with today's leadership.
For those who have contributed to the Friday events, I just want to say one thing: when the country moves to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and state services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Layborist Party.
In fact, I have another message, but not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, both members of the Layborist Party, and not: I am proud that I serve you, and I promise that no threats to withdraw me and no political advantage will prevent me from acting according to my view of the best interests of all of you.

"Air" 38-17 Melrose: Unbelievable Airs are rising up
Two recent attempts may have distorted some of the final outcome, but no doubt the Air deserved a triumph in the today's wonderful entertainment game of the Prime Minister of Scotland.
Now they're leading the table, it's the only invincible team of ten.
Finally, a wonderful defense and a better ability to use opportunities gives the hosts and coach Peter Mercy full right to be satisfied.
"We have been testing our games, and we are still invincible, so I must be satisfied," he said.
Robin Christy, from Melrose, commented: "I give the right "Ayre," they've better used the chances than we did."
The attempt of Grant Anderson at the 14th minute, which was implemented by Frazie Climo, led the Air forward, but the yellow card for Scotch Captain Rory Hughes, Verriors, allowed Melros to show the figures, and Jason Baggott used an unreasonable attempt.
Climo reinforced the Air leadership through the tools and did and performed a solo-test right before the break, which gave the account 17-5 for the Eire.
But Melrose started the second time, and the attempt of Patrick Anderson, which was implemented by Baggot, decreased to five points.
Then there was a continuing delay because of a serious injury of Roarid Knott, who was brought out from the field on the bags, and the Air Restaurant ran forward through the attempt of Stafford McDowell, which was implemented by Climo.
The captain Blair McFerson then had a yellow card, and again Melrose made another player pay the unreasoned attempt of Bruce Colvin under an intense pressure.
The masters returned, however, when Struan Hatchinson got a yellow card for Climo's capture without a ball from the line of the fine land, McFerson made a tachdown behind the Eire Moil.
Climo performed an attempt that he did almost every time after the restart, after that Kyle Row received a hit from David Armstrong in the box and sent Gregor Henry's flanker to the fifth attempt of the owner's team.
Looks like the star of "All games" is set up for a new career in the restaurant area.
It seems that the star of the "All Game" Ford Kyran is set up for a new career in the field of hospitality, and that can be concluded after it became known that he was the director of the licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC television, a scenario that he writes to and in which he's been shooting with an old comedian partner Greg Hamphill.
Duet announced that the future nineth series would be the last in the series, and it seems that Kirnan is planning life after Craigleng.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although the source in Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan wanted to enter the “prosperous restaurant business ” of Glasgo.
The Sea of Our: Interior Bolivia hopes that the court will open her way to the Pacific
The seamen are patroling the fleet headquarters in La Pass.
The public buildings hang the ocean and blue flag.
The sea bases from the lake of Titicaca to Amazon are painted by the devise: “Where is our right sea.
We must bring it back."
In Bolivia, which has no seaway, still lives the memory of the loss of the coastal line that left Chile in the 19th century's bloody conflict because of natural resources, and there is the desire to swim again in the Pacific.
These hopes are probably the strongest in the last decades, because Bolivia is waiting for the international court to decide on October 1, after five years of trial.
“ Bolivia has a impulse, there is a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, it expects a positive outcome, ” commented Roberto Calsadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many of the Bolivians will observe the ICU’s announcement on large screens across the country, and they hope that the Hague tribunal will decide for the benefit of Bolivia, that after decades of interviews, Chile will force the negotiations of the sovereign exit of Bolivia to the sea.
Eva Morales, a charismical root president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his revolution in the next year, also puts great hopes on a decision that will be announced on Monday.
“ We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide for the benefit of Bolivia, and if that happens, there will be little changes.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no authority to condemn the Chilean territory and noted that there will be no results of possible negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the ICTY was taken only six months after the final arguments were given indicates that the case was not "complicated," said Pas Zarate, Chilean expert in international law.
Bolivia’s case was not moving forward, and the last four years could have contributed to the retreat.
"The question of access to the sea was used by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
The warrior Morales exploded the remains of Chile’s kindness, she assumed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue a dialogue at a time, but then it will be very difficult to discuss.
Two countries have not been exchanged by ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodrigues Veltze, a representative of Bolivia in Hague, disagreed that the court’s decision was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will receive “a extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and the chance to end 139 years of distinction by gaining mutual benefits, ” he said.
Calsadia also denyed that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America — used the marine issue as a political milice.
“ Bolivia will never refuse its right to access the Pacific, ” he added.
This determination is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, says that his country will never give up its nuclear weapons before he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises expressed during the summit in Singapore by the leaders of the contest countries.
His comments appeared when the US Secretary Mike Pompeo appears to be on the doorway of the restart of nuclear diplomacy that went into a deaf corner more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Chen In.
Ri says that the belief that the continuation of sanctions and resistance of the United States Declaration of the End of Korean War will once put North Korea on the knees is a “infinite dream. ”
Washington fears to accept the declaration before Phenyan takes significant disarmament steps.
The American President Donald Tramp wants a second meeting.
But there is a widespread skepticalism that Phenyan seriously considers his arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyan next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Tramp.
The last trend of massive main clothing was presented in Paris’ fashion show, which is already on the main streets of your city.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, you find what you need to do.
Valentino and Tom Brown designers showed a number of excentric main clothings in the style of oversights from spring summer 2019 on a brilliant Paris week of fashion.
Very irrespective hats caught Instagram this summer, and the named designers have already sent their puzzling creations outside the spectrum.
Valentino was designed by an extravagant beach hat with broad beauty fields that closing the heads of the models.
Among other overlays-accessors are decorated by precious stones of coffee, a hat of wizard and even anananas hat, but they're not to keep their head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated the original masks — very timely before Halloween.
Many of these colored masks had sewed lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than a high fashion.
One of the creations looked like an apparatus for a submarine swimming with a pipe and the glasses, and another looked like the ice cream that was stretched.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you're lucky.
Stillists say that huge hats can come out on the main streets of your city.
The oversize caps came into fashion with the "La Bombi" hat with a width of sixty centimeters that were seen at all: from Rianna to Emily Ratazkovski.
Cultural brand behind a very irrespective hat, which could be seen everywhere in social networks, gave peace another creation: a sharp beach bag sizeed almost as a model in the bathroom that was carrying it.
The purse with the yellow red raphia with a raphia and a white skin pen was the central element of the La Riviera summer collection of 2019 Jacquemus brand on the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitaz, a famous artist, told F.S.A.S.A.S.E.: “The next summer I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets of cities, because the designer’s influence is so huge that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for overlays-accessources.”
John Edward: The knowledge of languages is mandatory for citizens of the world
Independent schools of Scotland support high school standards, and in 2018 there are reappropriate results of exams that are supplemented by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music, and other areas.
These schools, in which more than 30,000 students are studyed throughout Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SRNS), and they want to provide the best level of services for students and their parents.
Independent schools are intended to prepare students for a further and higher education chosen by their career, and make them citizens of the world.
As a educational sector that can develop and introduce a individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable object for choosing in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man of the language she understands, she considers it intelligence.
If you speak to her in her own language, she takes it to her heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot use English only if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent test results this year, we see that independent schools of language are leading in the ratings of items with best scores.
In general, 68 percent of the students studying foreign languages received a higher ball of A.
The data collected in 74 SRNS schools showed that 72% of the students received higher ball A from Chinese, and 72% of the German students, 69% of the French students, and 63% of the Spanish students also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will need in the future.
The languages as an object for choice are now taught as NTIM objects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent school programmes and in other institutions.
The study carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of the reasons why employers can't close vacancies related to the lack of language skills.
So the language skills are increasingly needed in preparing young people for the future career.
Since more prospective positions need knowledge of languages, these skills are necessary in the globalized world.
Regardless of the selected career, if someone learns the second language, he will have a real advantage in the future, because it's a skill for life.
The possibility of direct communication with people from other countries automatically gives a person who has several languages preferred competitives.
According to a YouGov study conducted among more than 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75% could not speak foreign language enough to support the conversation, and the French is the only language in which a binary percentage of people was spoken (15%).
That's why investments in teaching languages are now important for modern children.
Knowing several languages, especially the languages of developing countries, will give children more chances to find full - time jobs.
In Scotland, they will study their languages in every school.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important to Britain since 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, you can always choose several languages to study them with qualified teachers.
Scotland’s independent schools are trying to create a educational environment that prepares children and arms them with skills necessary to achieve success, regardless of the future.
Now we can't deny that international business centres of language continue to have vital importance for the future country, so it should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be considered “the skills of international communication. ”
Independent schools will continue to make this choice, diversity and perfection of Scotland’s youths.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scotland Council of Independent Schools

How many minutes will he play, not yet resolved.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton at the Lakers official site.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell reported that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.

"In this stage of my career to prepare, I don't need pre-season games," he replied.
Tramp Mytings in Western Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Tramp is starting today a series of pre-electoral mytings from Wiling City, West Virginia.
It's the first of five planned for the next week of Tramp's mything, including myths in the friendly-defined states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidacy proposed by the Supreme Court was delayed, and Tramp wants to form support for future medium - century elections, since the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress after the vote in November.
At what hour will this evening show Tramp in the West Virginia, and how can we look at it on the Internet?
Trampa miting in Wiling City in West Virginia planned for 19 hours at eastern time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Tramp's myth in the West Virginia online below in a direct air on YouTube.
Tramp is likely to mention the stressful hearing that happened this week about the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano, who is accused of sexual harassment, and the delay of the Senate's vote for a week while the FBI investigation continues.
But the main goal of this series of myths is to help the Republicans to become popular before the elections in November.
The representatives of President Tramp stated that these five mytings next week focused on “activization of volunteers and favourites, because the Republicans are trying to save and expand most of the representatives they have in the Senate and Palace,” reports Reuters.
“The control of the Congress is so critical for its daily order that the president will go to as many states as possible, because the season of the pre-election campaign is approaching," Reuters told the representative of the Tramp campaign, who did not want to call his name.
At the Vesbanko Arena stadium, today’s mything may come from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the media from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday visit will be a second visit in the last month to Trampo to Western Virginia, where he took over 40 percent of the votes in 2016.
Tramp is trying to help a candidate from the Republicans to the Western Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisi, whose rating is due to the results of the surveys.
“ This is not good for Morrisi that the president is coming to raise his rating in the surveys, ” commented Reuters Simon Heather, a politician from the West Virginia University.
Rider's cup 2018: U.S. team is set up to fight and hopes for Sunday Singles
After three sessions ending with one - side victory, afternoon the Saturday Forsoms may become just what the Rider Cube was missing.
The immediate pulse cartridge is a totally concept of sports, in which players really believe, especially in similar competitions.
So when do they say that the pulse is working?
"They were six points ahead, and now at four, so I think we take it a little bit like a impulse," said Jordan Spit when he left.
Europe, of course, has four points ahead and another twelve in the game.
The Americans, as Spit says, feel a little wind in their sails, too, encourages them, not at the end of the form of Spith and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each earned three points of four.
Spit with his killing punches from the thi-bag to the grain shows an example.
These screaming screams became more loud when he made a decisive pat and compared the account on the fourth match after he and Thomas were standing back to two points.
His patt, who let them win the 15-hole match, met with a similar scream that tells you that the American team doesn't seem to be.
"You really need to try very hard and worry about your own match," said Speet.
That's all that each of these players left now.
18 holes to become famous.
The only players with more scores than Spit and Thomas, in the last two days, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the unlikely story of the Rider Cube.
An unusual, but a charming couple in Europe has four of the four and cannot make mistakes.
Mollywood was the only couple who didn't make a godgy on Saturday afternoon, and they also managed to avoid Godgi in the morning of Saturday and afternoon on Friday and nine last holes on Friday morning.
This running and how their energy seems to flow to this bouncing crowd and back, it forces them to believe that they win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players except Flitwood or Molinari to strengthen the potential victory of the Europeans when the sun comes over Le Golf National.
Both are desired on different holes at the same time.
However, talking about the triumph of Europeans is yet early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning’s footballs when he was in a couple with Alex Norren.
One godgi and two crawls in the first nine holes brought a Spanish and Sweden to a hole that they could never get out of.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
It's very interesting to watch for the footballs and forsomas closely through the interaction between the couples, through the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and interesting to see how the strategy can change in one moment.
Europe is currently playing better as a team and has a great advantage on the last day, but this forsom session also showed that the U.S. team is intending to fight, which some, especially Americans, are doubting.
Europe leads with 10-6 accounts on the last day of the Rider Cube
On the final day, the Rider Cube of Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturday Footballs and Forsoms it's ahead of the United States with 10-6.
The inspired duet of Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari got two victories over the durable Tiger Woods, and now at Le Golf National they have four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to restore the trophy that they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, was dominating the American team in the morning footballs with account 3-1.
The United States had made more resistance in the forsoms and won two matches, but they couldn’t reduce the break.
Jim Furic's team needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to save the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European new man who won four points along, while he and Mollinari (together Mollywood) after the sensible weekends are only the second pair that took four points in the first four matches in the history of the Rider Cube.
By breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in the footballs, they joined them to defeat the defeated Woods and the new American brayson Dashambo with even more effective 5th4.
Woods, who pulled two matches on Saturday, showed random explosions of geniusity, but now he played 19 out of 29 matches in the footballs and forsomas and seven matches in a seven.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning footballs, returned to Henry Stanson’s partner in the forsoms to defeat the account of 2th1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coupka, who are the first and third in the world’s rating.
Europe couldn't do everything in her own, this nice fresh day to the southwest of Paris.
Three times, Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans by their two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive victory of the Spanish John Ram and Ian Poulter in the footballs and later conquered Poulter and Rory McClroy with a 4th3 account in the forsoms, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Rider Cube, the team came back with a deficit in four points in singles, although the Furrick team needed nothing to save the trophy.
But after the second place for two days, the counteract looks like they can't.
North Korea says that “in no case” will be disarmed in unilateral order without trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea reported on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions increases the lack of confidence in the United States, and that in such circumstances, the country will never be able to deny its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the United Nations General Assembly that in the past year, North Korea has taken “the important measures of goodwill ” such as nuclear and missile trials, nuclear testing destruction, and the obligation not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"And we do not see the appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, we will never be first armed in one-sided order."
Although Ri repeated the known complaints of North Korea on Washington’s “poetaptic ” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for progressive steps, his statement was important because it did not reject the unilateral denuclearization that Phenyan had done in the past.
Ree refered to the joint statement of Kim Chen and Donald Tramp at the first summit in history between the real President of the United States and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim called on to work on the “denauclearization of the Korean half-wester” and Tramp promised the security guarantee of North Korea.
North Korea wants to formally end the Korean war 1950 - 53 years, but the United States stated that Phenyan should first refuse nuclear weapons.
Washington also resists calls to weaken severe international sanctions on North Korea.
"U.S. insist on "denauclearisation first" and increase pressure by sanctions to achieve their goal violently, and even deny the "against war closing," said Ri.
“ To believe that sanctions can put us on the knees, the unreal dream of those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases our lack of confidence."
Ree did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trampe, which the U.S. leader stressed at the UN at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to the three meetings of Kim and the South Korean leader Mun Jee In in the last five months and added: “If the question of denuclearization was South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean half-ostrove would not be in such a deaf corner.”
Nevertheless, the tone of the speech of Ri was sharply different from the last year when he told the General Assembly that the targeting of North Korea's missiles to the ultimate part of the United States was inevitable after the “Mr. Wrong President” Tramp called Kim a “human-racket” who wanted to commit suicide.
This year, in the UN Tramp, who threatened to destroy North Korea, commended Kim for the courage of taking disarmament measures, but said that there would be much more to do and sanctions should remain in force before the danuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Tramp noted that he did not set the time frame for this: "It will take two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Phenyan for the steps made.
However, U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo stated to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The execution of the Security Council sanctions should continue vitally and inevitablely until we see the complete, final, confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has consequently increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block the financing of nuclear programmes and balistic missile Phenyan.
Pompeo met Ri in the United Nations General Assembly clubs and then said that next month he would visit Phenyan again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Phenyan in July and commented that progress was made, but a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for gangster requirements.
During the meeting with Mun in this month, North Korea promised to deploy the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States has taken appropriate measures.
He said that, according to Kim, he needed “suitable measures ” to be security guarantees that Tramp promised in Singapore, and steps to normalize the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students go a course about how to rest
The new course at the Harvard University this year provided more sleep to all his students, trying to combat the growing culture of cruel learning all night after caffeine fuel.
The teacher found that university students number one in the world are often unscientific when it comes to the very foundations of how to care for themselves.
Charles Chaseler, a doctor of sleep at the Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Women’s Brigam Hospital, developed a course that he believes to be the first such course in the United States.
He decided to initiate a course after he talked about the impact of deprivation of sleep on teaching.
In the end, one girl approached him and said, “Why are they telling me this now, at the last course? ”
“ She told her that no one ever told her about the importance of a dream that surprised me, ” said the Telegraph teacher.
At the first time in this year, students explain the foundations of how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports results and improve their overall well - being.
Paul Barrayra, a professor of the Harvard Medical School Psychiatric and executive director of the University of Health, said that the university decided to introduce a course after it was discovered that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there's a picture of the room in a group where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effect of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deficit on sports rates, and the importance of the routine related to sleep.
The other chapter tells participants how long - time deprivation of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, infantry, depression, and cancer.
Next, the map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of the students instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the consequences of smoking cigarettes for health," said Professor Chaseller.
The culture of pride for the sleeping all night still exists, he added, and he said that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students means that the problem of sleep is increasing.
A sufficient sleep of good quality should be a “secret weapon ” of a student to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, even with an excessive weight, because the deprivation of sleep translates the brain into a hunger mode that causes constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaseller develop a course after he entered one of his other courses last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to contact all the students with a request for a similar learning program to come to a competitive institution.
Professor Chassler recommends students to remind them that they need to go to bed, as well as to put an awake and to be aware of the harmful influence of the “blue light ” that radiates by electronic screens and light-based lamps and may break the circuit rhythm that leads to problems with sleeping.
Levingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengi's gol was awkward with Gerard's boys
"Rangers" survived the next trip of trip: Dolly Menga's hit brought a distinct team of Steven Gerard defeat with account 1-0 of Levingstone.
The Eibrox team wanted to win its first victory on the triumph after February's triumph of St. Johnstone with account 4-1, but the team of Gary Holt did a second defeat as a 18-hair manager. Gerard's team remained eight points behind the Scotland Prime Minister Harts.
Manga slipped up seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, which was lacking inspiration, didn’t look like it could compare the account.
Now the Rangers are down to the sixth position, and Levingston rises to the third, and only Hybernian is in front of them.
Furthermore, the Rangers may face another trouble, because the Lyneman Calum Spence had to handle the head wound after he was thrown into a object from the guest sector.
Gerard made eight changes in the team that once passed by the Air into the half-finals of the Scotland League Cube.
And Holt released the same composition of Levi 11, which took one point in the Harts last week, and was excited by how his forced boys pushed the rivals on each step.
Rangers may have been dominated by the ball, but Levingstone has worked more with the ball.
They were to kill only two minutes later when the first pass of Menga in the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit Alan McGregor's gate, but the semi-protector wasted this big chance by sending a ball by the gate.
The deep free strike of Keagan Jacobs came to Craig Halkett's skipper, but his defence partner Alan Litgow hit the back stack.
The Rangers really got control, but in the last third there were more hopes than their faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he had to get the right to a tool at the marking for a quarter of an hour after the struggle with Steven Loules, but Stephen Thompson refused to call the Colombian.
The Rangers had only two hits on the gates in the first time, but the former Aibrox gateman of Liam Kelly, who was headed by Lassana Culibal, and the calm hit of Ovier Ejaria, was hardly disturbed.
Although the last Levingstone goal for 34 minutes may have contradicted the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it only by their hard work.
The Rangers failed to manage Jacobs' cooking again.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallacher sent a ball to Scott Robinson, who quietly chose Menga to make a simple end.
During the break, Gerard replaced Culibali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately worked when henger broke down to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of his line to lock it.
However, Levingstone continued to force guests to play the game they like when Litgow and Halkett make a long pass.
Holt's team could have improved the results in the last stages, but McGregor had a good opposition to Jacobs before Litgow hit the corner.
Glenn Middlton, a substitute to Rangers, made another late request for a fine when he faced Jacobs, but Thompson again took a look.
Almanah: Geiger's inventor
And now the page from our Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and the time is going... in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Gans Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measureing radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as Geiger's number.
From then on, Geiger has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of the popcultural, for example, in the 1950 Coronado Bells with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play doubtful of the appearance of cowboy scientists.
A man: “What is it? ”
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s number, used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these ears, you can really hear how the radioactivity atoms affect the minerals."
Evans: "Well, it's really cracking right now!"
"Gans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention of his name continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see ” malicious cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see ” the malicious cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise malicious cells, which are part of the treatment
The method foresees the elimination of immune cells in the patient and their changes in the lab
Then these cells are able to “see ” proteins that are common to many cancer species, and then these cells are reintroduced to the patient.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who has received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize the bad quality cells, the cancer of eggs disappears for more than 18 months.
The method includes the elimination of immune cells in the patient, changing them into the lab so that these cells can be seen as common to many types of protein cancer (HER2), and continuing to reintroduce these cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofski, from the National Institute of Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, noted: “Our results show that we have received a very prospective vaccine. ”
"HER2" stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, eggs, lungs and colorful cancer," he explained.
Similar approach, which consists of eliminated immune cells in patients and “training ” to target cancer cells, has worked in treating one of the types of leukemia.
After showing up at the SNL show at the MAGA Canye West's baseball studio, he had a sharp talk to the support of President Tramp,
what caused a negative response to the viewers
The watches in the SNL show studio (Saturday night in direct air) whistled Canier after his summurous talk during which he praised the President of the United States, Donald Tramp, and said that he would be chatting for the presidential post in 2020.
After performing the third song called Ghost Town in a baseball inscription "We're going to return America's former glory," he exploded by a tirade in which he discovered the democrats, and reiterated his support to Tramp.
"They often ask me, "How can you like Tramp? He's a racist."
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have left America for a long time," he said.
Shaw SNL began with Matt Damon’s sketch, where the Hollywood Star laughed at the testimony of Brett Cavano, which he was giving before the Senatu Legal Committee in the case of Christine Blazey Ford on sexual violence.
Although West’s talk was not transmitted directly, the video with its tirada was put in the social network of the Chris Rock comic.
It remains misunderstanding whether Rock wanted to laugh at West by putting this post.
The West also complained to the watchers that there was an unfortunate situation with him because of the main clothing.
According to Washington Examiner, West said, "When I was behind the buildings, they acted rudely to me.
They told me, "Don't go out to the watchers in this baseball."
They were messing with me!
And then they tell me I'm in a place where the oppressed are silent."
The West continued, "Do you want to see where the oppressed people are silent?" I'm going to wear my superman baseball, because that's how no one can tell me what to do.
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to Variety's week, his comments caused at least twice the negative response of the watchers in the hall, and the SNL show players looked lost, and one of the viewers said, "The studio had a dead silence."
The last minute was invited to replace Ariana Grande’s singing, whose former boyfriend, Reper McMiller, died a few days before the air.
The West called in many surprises by performing the song I Love it (I love it) in a bottle of water Perrier.
The news supported the head of the TPUSA Conservative Organization, Kendes Turner, who wrote on Twitter, "One of the bravest: thanks for the opposite of the NATO. "
Instead, the leading show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West is who he is, and it's just great.
"But I'm not going to reward it (buying his music or clothing or supporting it as art), who, I think, is confessing and exposing ideology that hurts my community.
He is a free man.
Like us," she added.
Before he showed the raper, he announced in Twitter that he changed his name: now he's the one used to be known as Canier West.
West isn't the first performer who changed his name, he's imitating the example of Grandpa, also known as Paff Deedy, Paffy and P. D.D.
Snoop Dogg's colleague called Snoop Lyon before, and, as we know, the music legend of the last decades, Prince has changed his name into a symbol, and then became "Article known earlier as Prince."

The star of the Throne Game, Keith Gerrington, condemns the idealization of brutality
Keith Gerrington became famous because of the role of a warrior with the sword of John Snow in the brutal medium-economic series "The Game of Throne" of HBO.
However, 31-year-old actor condemned the stereotype of macho, claiming that because of these heroes on the screens, young boys often feel like they should become cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture Cat, he said, "Something went wrong," and asked how to solve the problem of the idealization of brutality in the age of the hashtag's popularity #Meto#they, #they, etc.).
A cat, who recently married his colleague at the Game of the Throne, 31-year-old actor of Rose Lesley, said that he was "decisively" to fight this problem.
"I am now quite determined, and when did we get on the slide of the idealization of brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men if we look at their growing up because of the prime of the problem we see now?"
Keith believes that television is partly responsible for the popularization of brutality because of the images of extremely brave heroes.
He said, "What's natural and what are we planted?
Why teaches television and streets that young boys feel pressure to be such men?
I think that today is a very important question, “How should we change this? ”
It's obvious that the young boys have fallen off the right way."
In the interview, he also pointed out that he would not be taking off in any precells and sequences of the Games of the thrones after the end of the series next summer, because he's already finished with battles and horses.
From November, Keith will play a real west play of Sam Shepherd, a story about the film producer and his brother robber.
As an actor recently confessed, he respects the meeting with his wife Rose the best that he received from the "Game of Thrones" series.
"When I took a picture in this series, I met my wife, so he gave me the future family and determined my future life," said Keith.
In a fantastic series that got Emmy's rewards, Rose played the Igritt, the love of the hero of Gerington John Snow.
A couple married in June 2018, and the ceremony was held in the territory of the family of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China claims that 14 per cent of new diseases are increased by 14 per cent
In China, an increase of 14 per cent of people who have HIV and AIDS has been reported.
According to healthcare officials, more than 820 000 patients are generally in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new diseases were reported.
In most cases, the disease was transmitted in sexual ways that indicated the change in the past trend.
In some regions, HIV was rapidly distributed through infected blood during transfusion.
However, as officials of the healthcare authorities stated during the conference held in the Yunnan province, the number of people infected with HIV was almost zero.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Transfer of HIV through time is a serious problem for Chinese LGBT community.
The decrimination of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but the LHBT community often suffers from discrimination.
According to research, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sexual relations with other men continue to marry women because of conservative values in the country.
The transmission of disease in most cases occurs as a result of inappropriate use of protective measures during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised to provide free access to HIV medicines, seeing this partly to solve the problem.
Maxine Watters denies the inflammation of republic senators in the network of her state employee and criticizes "safe lies" and "theory of conspiracy."
On Saturday, a member of the US Palace of Representatives Maxine Waters condemned a voice statement that one of its state employees had placed the personal data of three American Republican Senators on their websites in Wikipedia.
The Democrat from L.A. claims that these statements are spreading ultra-right political viewers and websites.
"Battle, lie, and then even more disgusting lie," said Waters in Twitter.
The public information was reported to include the home addresses and phone numbers of United States Senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The data appeared on the network on Thursday, and they were placed by an unknown person from Capitol during the hearing in the Senate Commission on the charges of sexual offences against Brett Cavano, a candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The source of the data happened a while after three senators questioned Cavano.
The The Hill reported that on conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, there were information that the IP source address was linked to the Waters office and it was able to find the data of its state colleague.
"It is absolute lies, they don't match the reality," Waters continued.
"A colleague of my office, whose personal data and security are threatened by these fabricated and liar statements, has nothing to do with the source of this information.
These unreasonable claims are absolute lies, they don't match the reality."
The statement was quickly discovered on the network, among others, the former press secretary of the White House of Ary Flysher.
"This opposition is full of anger," wrote Flysher.
"It suggests that with such nature, she cannot be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of what he did not do, he does not need to be angry.
The accused should not act overwhelmingly.
He should not ask about the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and untouched."
Apparently, Flysher had a parallel between the Waters reaction and the criticism of democrats at Judge Cavano, who was accused of being too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republican Party, who is balloted to take the Watters place on the results of the intermediate elections, also expressed his opinion in Twitter.
"This is the news if it's true," he wrote.
In her statement, Watters noted that her office has already reported "suitable public authorities and law enforcement bodies on these false statements."
"We will do everything we can to find the guilty," she continued, "and they replied before the law for their actions which are harmful and dangerous to all my workers."
"Agent Johnny English: New Mission" is the passing parody to spy fighters with Rowen Atkinson
It has already become a good tradition to look for in every new British film of ideas, the Brexit. They are also in the new part of the comedial parodies for fighters about Johnny England. The first film called Johnny English has come on the screen in 2003, later restarted in 2011 by restarting "Johnnie English".
Will it be a ridiculous and ironical self-satisfactor for what we're short, a new export potential for the nation?
In any case, Johnny Englez, with his moving face and his eyes, again, got the opportunity to make a mess, and his name more than anything else indicates that this comic character is created for non-angular viewers.
As we know, Johnny is a cheerlessly fun secret agent in which, despite his strange attempts to be galant and charming, it is a little bit of Mr. Bean's inspector, and a lot of things from the guy who played one note of the film "Fire Cars" at the ceremony of the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
The picture of the character is also a traveler and a mystery of the international scale that always left behind a mess that Atkinson once played in a long - forgotten television advertisement of Barclaycard.
In the last movie about Johnny English, there are a few nice moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny Inglish approached the helicopter, and his helmet's shovels danged about his helmet.
In the film, Atkinson's talent is to make a buffonade, but humor is passing through, and at some times it's too much, especially if you compare with "serious" film brands, like "Agent 007" and "The Mission is impossible", one of the "ingredients" which are also comedy.
It seems that the jokes of children rather than the adults, and my stupid attacks that happen with Johnny English, don't seem as inventive and thoughtful as Atkinson's jokes in bine's German movies.
Like always, the film begins with a serious threat over Britain.
The British supersecret spy network is hackering and revealing the names of all field agents, which has become a total surprise for an active agent (regretably Kevin Eldon played only an episode role in the movie).
This turned out to be the last drop for the Prime Minister -- a proud person who has already suffered a destructive criticism and is in deep depression because of the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson tried to best transmit the image of Teresa May, but the script did not make it fullly open).
Intelligence advisors informed her that all active agents were compromised, and she had to be involved in some of the retirement agents.
The choice falls to an incredible Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in some supermodern establishment and informally teaches children the operational work undercover (in this part with the spine school of the year, England for adolescents had several successful jokes).
Englez is quickly delivered to Whitegole for an emergency briefing, where he again meets his long - suffering friend Buff, who is played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to the captain of the submarine boat (the role of an excelted exhaust person is not exactly the talent of Vicki Pepperdin).
So when everything in Her Majesty's Secret Service went back, "Batman and Robin" are returning to the line and suddenly meet the fatal woman of Ophelia Pistolet, played by Olga Kurillenko.
And at this time, the Prime Minister comes under charms of a charming charming charitable billionaire who earned his product in the field of technology and technology and claims that he can eliminate the problem with the British network, the horrible Jason Volt, who was played by Jake Lacey.
Andanglish and Buff are going on their trip and reappearing into their ridiculous tricks: they are dressed by waiters and they are making a fire in a beautiful French restaurant; they continue to sow chaos, illegally leaving abroad on a luxury boat of Volta; England is making real mess when they try to use a helmet of virtual reality to learn about the planning of the house of Volta.
All the stops lead us to the last episode, but by his kindness and madness, he resembles the movies for children.
It's a movie.
Like the other movies about Johnny English, I asked myself the same question: Can the British film industry not offer Rowen Atkins the role that really corresponds to his talent?
Layborists deny the preparation of a plan that the British will work four days a week, but they'll get paid in five days.
The Layborist Party, Jeremy Corbina, has to discuss a radical plan that the British will work four days a week, but they will be paid in five days.
It's reported that the party wants to oblige the company's leaders to transfer the funds saved as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution, the employees, giving them an extra weekend.
Thus, workers will have a three - day weekend, bringing home the same salary.
According to sources, this idea will respond to the economic programme of the party and direct the resources of the country to support the working class.
The four-day working week was approved at the British Trid Junion Congress, and it is apparent that workers will be able to benefit from changing the general economic situation.
The source in the Layborist Party informed the Sunday Times as follows: "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
It's not going to change in one night, but the idea of a four-day working week is the approach of the party to change the economic balance for workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party."
Layborists did not first accept this idea because the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day working week during the pre-election campaign in 2017.
However, not all members of the Layborist Party approve of this desire.
Spiker of the Laborist Party said, "The political program of the party does not provide for a four-day working week, so we don't consider this idea."
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy at the pre-election of the Layborist Party last week.
Mr. McDonnell stated that he was determined to take power back from the "no-like directors" of communities and "explorers".
The Shadow Officer's plan also means that shareholders of water supplies can not get their entire share of capital if the layborist government triggers "counting" on the basis of imaginary violations.
He also confirmed the intention of inclusive accumulation funds to provide 10% of the normal shares of private sector companies to workers who are waiting for annual dividends of up to 500 pounds of sterlings.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are telling at the 60-minutes show (60 minutes) whether the Cavano investigation leading the FBI can change their views
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Cavano, who leads the FBI, the final vote for his assignment to the Supreme Court is postponed for at least a week.
In the Sunday Show 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelly asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham whether the FBI could find something that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
'Yes, of course,' said Kennedy.--
During the hearing, I told him that I had a conversation with Judge Cavano.
I called him after everything happened and came out of the accusation, and asked him: “You really did this? ”
He was decisive, firm, compromised."
It seems that Graham’s mind will no longer change.
"I believe that the provocation of Cavano's accusations is a provocation," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know what, Brett definitely denyed everything," added Greem, turning to Christine Blaze Ford.
And everyone who she calls can't confirm it under the oath.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't understand what can change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and how can it affect poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will take the Global Citizen Festival, a annual event in the music world with an impressive number of star performers and no less disturbing mission, to combat poverty throughout the world.
During the seventh Festival Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will be masturbed on the Great Galavine of Central Park, not only to enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez's performances, as well as to draw attention to the real purpose of the festival, organizers want to overcome the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
The Festival Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international public organization that is expecting to eradicate poverty by increasing the numbers of people who will fight it actively.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (if you don't want to pay VIP tickets), visitors have to perform a set of tasks or "deeds", such as learning in a volunteer project, writing an email to the world's leader, make a phone call or anything else to help bring attention to the purpose of the organization -- to eradicate poverty.
So are there any results, since the goal of the Global Citizen organizers remained 12 years?
Is it really the idea of rewarding for free concert - a brilliant way to convince people to require action, or is it just another case of so-calctivism, when people feel that they really change something by signing an electronic petition or making a publication in Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have fixed 19 million "deeds" of their advocates to achieve different goals.
The organization claims that these acts have motivated world leaders to claim planned financial appropriations and programmes for more than 37 billion dollars, which will help to change life by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group described the results of its 390 financial obligations and public statements, and at least 10 billion have already been collected and spent.
According to estimates, the funds provided have already directly affected the lives of about 649 million people around the world.
Among the main financial obligations, you can remember the Food Power of Nutrition Fund, which is territorially referring to Britain. In the context of the project investors and implementers, they have taken the commitment to "help the children to grow" and promised Rwanda to give $35 million help to overcome the problem of malnutrition after they received more than 4700 messages in Twitter from the Global Citizens organization.
"With the support of the British government, the staff, the governments of other countries and citizens of the world, such as you, we can make a social problem of malnutrition with a small fact of history," said the representative of the Power of Nutrition Tracy Ullman, speaking to the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5000 "deeds" that encouraged the improvement of mothers and children's nutrition, the British government announced the funds for the The Power of Nutrition project to improve the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children.
In answer to one of the common questions on your website, "Why do you think you can overcome the extreme level of poverty?"
The Global Citizen representatives wrote, "It's a long and difficult way, so sometimes we fall down and we're failing.
But, like the citizens' movements and against the apartheid to us, we're going to make it successful, because we're stronger together."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd group, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Genell Mona, are just part of the star performers that will be presented this year at the New York festival and will be led by Deborah Lee Fernes and Guy Jackman.
The Minister of Interior stated that the United States could use military forces to "block" to prevent the export of Russian energy
According to the US Interior Minister, Ryan Zinke, quoted in Washington Examiner, "as necessary" Washington can contact the military forces to prevent the exit of Russian energy on the markets, including the Middle East markets.
Zinke stated that the participation of Russia in the Syrian conflict, especially where it acts on the invitation of a legitimate government, is a reason to explore new energy women.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to become an energy medium, as they already do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"After the US military forces can ensure a free passage through the seaways and, if necessary, block them so that Russian energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the Western participants conducted by the Consumer Energy Alliance (Alliance of Energy Consumer Energy Alliance) -- a non-profit organisation that is positioned as "the voice of every consumer" in the United States.
Then he compared approaches to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually similar.
"Economic strategy for Iran and Russia is that we're effectively using energy resources and replaceing them with alternatives," he said, calling Russia "only-developed," because its economy depends on the energy of mineral origin.
While these statements were messed up, the Tramp Administration set aim to increase the export of compressed natural gas to Europe, ejecting the Russian energy market, a much cheaper option for the Europeans.
For this, the Staff of Tramp's administration and the President Donald Tramp themselves are trying to convince the German government to quit the "invaluable" project to build the Northern Stream 2 route, which, according to Tramp, Berlin will be the hostage of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly emphasized that the Northern Stream 2 gas is worth 11 billion dollars and that doubles the existing gasgon capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, exclusively an economic project.
The Kreml convinces Washington that he's enthusiasticly opposing the project for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share that energy resources cannot be a pressure tool and consumer should be able to choose suppliers," said the Russian Energy Minister, Alexander Novak, after meeting the US Energy Minister, Rick Perry, who was in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position caused a negative response to Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German leading organization of the field of the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI) urged the United States not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like the third country interfering with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Association of German Industry, after the last meeting of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren will seriously think about the president's post in 2020
Senator of the state of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that "he'll think seriously" about chatting for president's post after the intermediate elections.
During a meeting with the public in Golioc, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of her candidacy.
According to the The Hill Warren, "The time for women to go to Washington and set up the government's work, and for that, there should be a woman in his head."
"After November 6th, I'll think seriously about making my candidacy a president."
During the meeting with the public, Warren expressed her assessment of the Presidentship of Donald Tramp, saying that he "goes his country in the wrong direction.
"I'm extremely worried about what Donald Tramp is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank, criticizing Tramp and proposing a candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Cavano.
The Friday Tweet Warren wrote, "...without doubt, before the FBI votes, it's to investigate."
However, according to the results of the Friday survey published, most Warren voters don't think it should be talked in 2020.
According to the results of the survey conducted jointly by the Centre for Political Research of the University of Saffolk and the issue of the Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the potential voters in the state of Massachusetts have expressed against the expulsion of the senator of their candidacy.
Thirty - two percent supported the exhibition.
The results of the survey showed that greater support was used by former Governor Deval Patrick, which was 38% of the president's position, against 48%.
During the discussions of other famous democrats who can qualify in 2020, they also call the former Vice-President Joe Byden and the Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Baiden stated that he would decide until January.
Sarah Paylin refers to the PTSR Treck Paylin during the meeting on support of Donald Tramp
26-year-old Treck Paleen spent a year in Iraq after joining the military service in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence, and the incident occurred on Monday night.
"What my son is going through now, what he's going through after return, can only understand other families that experience the consequences of the PTSP and other health problems that our soldiers are coming home," she said to the participants in the miting to support Donald Tramp in Talsa, Oklagoma.
Paleen called Treck's arrest "the problem no one pays attention" and said that her son and other war veterans "will return home not as they used to be, more cruel, and they want to know if they respect what their brothers, pilots and other military workers have done for this country."
According to the dictionary of the police department of Vasil, Dan Bennett, Track was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and attacks against a woman, as well as that he prevented the reporting of violence and weapons in the state of alcoholic drunkenness.
18 states and district Colombia support the prosecution of shelter policy
Eighteen states and district Colombia support the prosecution of the new U.S. policy, according to which the victims of gangish persecution and domestic violence refused to give refugee status.
According to the NBC News, the representatives of 18 states and district have sent analytical note from the court advisor in Washington to support a shelter that needs shelter and accused the politics mentioned in the court order.
The full name of the invitation to Grace v. Seshance is called on by the American Union for the Protection of Civil Rights, which complains the federal politics and which has been filed in August, is not revealed.
The caller stated that her partner and his cruel sons-bands were beating her, but the US landlords refused her when she asked for the shelter on July 20th.
It was illegally held in Texas.
State prosecutors, who support Grace's lawsuits, stated that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (refugees of which often ask for refuge in the United States) often face such serious problems as gangism and domestic violence.
The new refugee status policy cancels the decision of the Appeals Council on Immigration in 2014, according to which immigrants without documents fleeing from domestic violence could ask for refuge.
General Prosecutor General Carl Reysin said on Friday during his talk that the new policy "is ignoring the decades of state laws, federal and international laws."
"The Federal Law requires that decision on claims of refugee status be based on the consideration of the facts and circumstances set out in this statement, and the ban violate this principle," says the analytical note of a court advisor.
The prosecutor's analytical note further suggests that politics that prevents immigrants from entering the U.S. is harming the economy of the country because they can potentially become entrepreneurs and "complete the necessary labour resources".
In June, the Prosecutor General Jeff Seshnes issued an order for immigration judges, in which they were no longer able to provide refugee status to those who flee from domestic violence and banditism.
"The shelter is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with racial belongings, religion, nationality, membership in certain public groups or political views," said Seshance during the presentation of politics on June 11th.
The accommodation of a shelter has never been aimed at dealing with all the problems, even the serious problems that people all over the world face every day.
Rescueers desperately try to find those who remain alive, while the number of deaths in Palo increased twice.
For those who remain alive, the situation continues to be worse.
"The situation is very tense," says 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with fever in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palo.
"Each minute, quick help brings the bodies.
The clean water is missing."
Some inhabitants return to their ruined homes, take over the drowned benefits, trying to save what they found.
Thousands of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by the earthquake, whose power was 7.5 points at Richter’s scale, are full.
Some of the wounded, including Two Harris with a broken back and shoulder, rest at the building of the army hospital of Palo, where patients are being assisted under the open sky through constant repeated strikes.
His eyes were filled with tears when he remembered the strong strike shocked the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he stayed with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for rescue.
I think I'm stuck in the middle of the breakdowns of the wall," said Harris to the Associated Press correspondent, adding that he and his family came to the city for the wedding.
"I heard my wife begging for help, and then the silence was ruled.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "promotion of psychological pressure" using "propaganda"
A week after the Chinese state newspaper posted an advertising material on the four pages of the American daily publication on the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, US Ambassador in China accused Peking of using US press to distribute propaganda.
The President of the United States Donald Tramp sent last Wednesday to the payment supplement of China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper of the State of Iowa after accusing China of attempting to influence the elections to the Congress that will take place on November 6th. China rejects these accusations.
As the Reuters Agency reported by officials in the United States, Trampa, who accuses Beijing of attempts to intervene in American elections, means a new escalation phase from Washington, which is aimed at pressure on China.
Although foreign governments can place a commercial advertising to intensify trade, there is an escalation of trade war between Beijing and Washington in time, where they have already improved the duties for imports.
According to China and the United States experts, at the beginning of this war, the repressive bribe in China was not enough to hit exporters from states such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party Tramp.
Terry Bransted, US Ambassador in China, and former Governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural products to China, stated that China had harmed American workers, farmers and companies.
China, as Brensted wrote in the column of the Des Moines Register Sunday, "builds pressure, publishing advertising, which contains propaganda, in our independent press."
"To spread the propaganda, the Government of China uses the road for the American people the tradition of freedom of speech and independence of the press, placeing a pay advertisement in Des Moines Register," said Bransted.
"In contrast, on the street layouts here, in Beijing, you will find only individual votes of foreigners, and there you will not see the real reflection of what the Chinese people actually think about the direction of the Chinese economy, which causes anxiety to conclude that the media of China are under reliable control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the most important Chinese publications suggested a publication" of his article, but didn't say what it was.
The analysts warn that the Republicans have a failure in Cavanaugh to set the elections against themselves.
Since many well - known Republicans support and protect the candidate to the judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano after he has been accused of sexual harassment, analysts warn that this may cause undesirable reactions in advance of future intermediate elections, especially women.
The situation is around passion, and most republicans publicly claim that they would want to go to the vote.
Then you can't just play back," said the Hill's interview published on Saturday, Grant Riger, a professor of Polytology of Maxwell University of Syracus.
Riger doubted that the FBI investigation that in the last minute insisted senator Jeff Flake, a republican from Arizona, would be enough to calm the angry voters.
According to Washington, D.C., the main advisor and the speaker of the progressive MoveOn group, Catherine Jean-Perryer said on Friday, "We won't forget what happened yesterday -- they won't forget it tomorrow or November."
According to Mic, on Friday morning, protesters sang "Listopad approaches!" during a demonstration at the Legal Committee, when the Republicans decided to move to the candidacy of Cavano, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazey Ford.
In an interview with the news site, Stu Rotenberg, an out-party political viewer, said, "The people will be very interested and motivated."
"It's what they say now, and it's true.
However, motivation can be increased, especially in the 18-29-year-old election women, from the precedents that have not yet been defined and often don't vote if they don't like the president."
Before Ford testified in connection with the prosecution of the candidate for the Supreme Court of Sexual Crime, the analysts predicted the negative response of the voters if the Republicans insisted on approval.
According to NBC News, earlier this week, the former head of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Michael Steel, said, "This is an uncomfortable story for the Republican Party."
As Gay Cecil said in the interview of the news channel, the director of the Priorities of the United States (U.S. Priorities) (group that helps democrats in the pre-electoral campaign) said, "the matter is not in the voting of the committee, the final vote or the fact that Cavano was found on the lawn of the accused, and how they responded to this situation and how they went on."
However, the thoughts of the Americans about whom the testimony of faith, Ford or Cavano, were divided, and the Ford has a little greater support.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents believe or rather believe in Ford’s testimony, while Cavano believes or rather 35 percent of the respondents.
Furthermore, 38 percent of the surveyers have noted that Cavano believed that he was giving or probably giving false testimony, while the Ford said the same thing about 30 percent of the surveyers.
According to The Guardian, after the insistences of Flake the FBI is conducting a check on the accusations made by Ford and another caller, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified under the oath of the Senatu Legal Committee on how Cavano attacked her in a state of alcoholic drunkenness when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez stated that the candidate for Judge of the Supreme Court showed her genitalia at the party during their Yale University in the 1980s.
The Internet inventor plans to start "new Internet" to create Google and Facebook competition
Tim Berners-Li, an inventor of the global Internet, starts a new startup to create Facebook, Amazon and Google competition.
The last project of the world's technology legend, Inrupt, is to develop a platform with the open source code of Solid, whose idea belongs to Berners-Lee.
With the Solid platform, users will be able to choose where to store data and who to provide access to some information.
In an exclusive interview, Fast Company Berners-Lee was kidding that the purpose of Inrupt was the world rule.
'We must do it now,' he said about startup.--
It's a historical moment."
The Solid technology is used to enable users to create a "personal online data repository" or the Pod.
It can contain contact lists, lists of current affairs, calendar, audio recording library, and other tools for personal use and work.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify at the same time.
The unique feature of this personal online data repository is that it's incompletely suitable to the user's needs that can get access to any information.
The company calls it "promotion of personal possibilities using data."
According to the Director-General Inrupt John Bruce, the company has to engage in resources, processes and appropriate skills so that the Solid platform will be available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners Lee, Bruce, the security platform bought in IBM, several state developers hired to work on the project, and the volunteers communities.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not negotiate from Facebook and Google about whether to make a full replacement when all their business models have had a major change in a short period of time.
"We don't ask for their permission."
The Saturday publication in Medium Berners-Li stated that the Inrupt company mission was "providing commercial energy and ecosystem and helping to protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the Consortium of the World Pavoutine at the Massachusett Technology Institute.
In recent months, Berners Lee is an influenced figure in the debate on network neutrality.
Even when I started Inrupt Berners-Lee, he remained the founder and director of the Consortium of the World Spider, the Web Foundation Fund and the Institute of Open Data.
"I look very optimisticly at the next era of network development," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Wann: celebrations about the delivery of the Church of the Victoria Order of the First World War
The only representative of the English Church, who received the Order of the Crest Victoria for the fighting during the First World War, was honored in his home town for 100 years later.
Lieutenant Bernard Vann was rewarded for the attack under Belghiz and Leokur on September 29, 1918.
However, he died from a sniper bullet four days later and never knew that he had received the highest military reward of Britain.
On Saturday, two of his grandsons discovered a memorial stone during the parade in Rashden, County of Northgamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Wann, called the "extremely symbolic" thing that the discovery of the memorial stone happened just 100 years after his grandfather made an award, for which he was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Wann transferred his battalion through the St. Katen channel through a very dense fog and under the dense fire of field guns and bullets.
Later, he hurried to the fire border, and with "desperate courage" he led a stream forward, before one broke into the field rifle and destroyed three arms of an enemy unit.
Lieutenant Vanna shot a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little more than a month before the war ends.
72-year-old Michael Wann said his grandfather did what he would never have been able to repeat and deserve respect.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, put a vein after a parade under the head of the Brantwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Wann said that "he feels very proud of taking part in this parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero is demonstrating the respect that so many people show him."
The MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206, instead they showed them "Peppa pig."
Imagine that you're not sleeping all night just to watch the Bellator 206, and you're refusing to see the main event.
There were 13 fights in San José’s tournaments, including six main programs that were transmitted live at night in Britain at 5 channels.
At 6:00 a.m., just before Hegard Mussasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to go together, the British TVs died of a surprise when on the screen instead of the fighting translating, a Peppe pig appeared.
Some viewers were not excited because they weren’t sleeping until the morning waiting for the fight.
One of the fans wrote in Twitter that switching to the child's painting was a "whacked joke."
"In accordance with the government's order, the content that was transmitted at 6:00 a.m. was inappropriate, so they were forced to release the child's transfer," said Dave Schwartz, the senior vice-president of the marketing and communications with the Bellator public when he asked him about the television,
"Pep's pig, yes."
The president of the company Bellator Scott Cocker promised to work on the broadcast schedule in order to capture British viewers in the future.
"I think that if we're talking about repeating the transmission, we'll be able to set it up," said Coker.
"But now there's Sunday, 6 a.m., and we can't do anything until we have Sunday and they have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the broadcast was turned off, we received a lot of messages that we answered, and the text of these messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was technical failure, and we tried to remove it.
However, it turns out that it was inappropriate to government laws.
I can promise you that this will never happen again.
We're going to reduce the tournament to five fights instead of six as usual, and we've been trying to redirect the signal for fans, but we're still postponing these attempts.
It's a really uncomfortable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt "worst" than others because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic jumping into the water tells Tom Daily that he grew worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but it motivated him to achieve success.
24-year-old sportsman said he didn't understand "not everyone like him" until he went to high school.
While participating in the release of the Desert Island Discs on the Radio 4, which Lauren Lavern is leading, he pointed out that he was openly speaking about the gay rights to give hope to others.
He also stated that because of parenthood, he became less concerned about the victory of the Olympic Games.
The leader, who has been running this program for a long time, Kirstie Yang, went to the hospital for a few months.
When Daily came as a party to the first Lavern program, he stated that he felt "worst" than others when he was a child, because "the society didn't take it when someone liked boys and girls."
He said, "So far, the feeling of minority and difference was just what gave me strength and strength to achieve success."
He said he wanted to prove something worthy to not disappoint all those who finally learned about his orientation.
The two-fold bronze olympic prize became a famous struggle for LBGT communities rights and used the appearance of this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to invite more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He stated that he spoke frankly about his views because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this hope to others.
The triple world champion confessed that his feelings to a man, a American movie director, Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, became a real surprise for him.
Daily married the Oscar Prize Laureat, older than him for 20 years, last year, but he said that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you're going through so many things in this young age," (on the first Olympic games, he was 14 years old, and three years later his father died of cancer, it's hard to find someone of his own age, who would also survive similar tricks and falls.
In June, there was a son who was called Robert Ray Black Daily, and since then, according to Daley, his "switness" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would only think about what I should get gold," he said.
"You know, there are things much more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son was called his father Robert, who died in 2011 when he was 40 years old after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daily said that his father could not reconcile the thought of the end, and before he died, he asked if they bought tickets for the London Olympiade 2012 because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, "you won't sit in the first row because you're gone," said Dali.
"I held him for his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
Next year Daily participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and got a bronze.
"I knew that this was what I dreamed about all my life: swimming in front of my companions at the Olympic Games, and there was no feeling better than that," said Dali.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song — Proud (Hordy) in the execution of Gizer Smoll — who resoned with him while preparing for the Olympic Games and still causes ants.
The Desert Island Discs program exits on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 at the English summer time.
On Saturday from the tournament for the Cubock Rider, Michaelson was brought out, who was out of shape.
The American Phil Michelson will set up a record on Sunday, playing his 47th game in the tournament for the Cubkok Rider, but he has to rebuild the shape so that this event doesn't become unhappy for him.
Michaelson, who took part in a 12th record tournament once for two years, took Captain Jim Furic out of the game at the time of the footballs and forsames.
Instead of being in the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, the five-time winner was encouraging the team all day and trained on the side, hoping to overcome emotions.
Since Michaelson wasn't famous for the proper strikes, even when he was at his career's peak, the 48-year-old sportsman didn't really fit for a complex field for Le Golf National golf, where the raff usually punish for wandering hits.
And if the field is not that obstacle, on the ninth match on Sunday, Michaelson will have to meet the champion of the Open Champion and the master of the exact hit Francisco Molinari, who won all his match this week.
If Americans who stand three points after 12 single matches start well, Michaelson's match can be decisive.
Furrick expressed confidence in his sportsman, and he probably had nothing to add to it.
"He fully understood his role today," said Furrick.
"He doesn't doubt his powers.
Michelson is a member of the Fame Hall, who has done so much for teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I predicted more matches, but it worked out, so we decided to do this.
He wants to be there, in the field, like anyone else."
If Michaelson gets out on the field on Saturday, he'll beat Nick Faldo's record, who played the largest number of matches in the Rider Cubock.
That's where he might end his career at the Rider Coubock tournament, which never responded to his individual achievements.
On Michaelson’s account, 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven erroneous results, but Furic said that his presence could play a crew’s crew’s crew.
"He's funny, messy, funny, he likes to joke with others, he's the guy who's great to have in the team," explained Furrick.
"I think the younger players had fun, raising at him and this week, and it was interesting to observe.
He's more than just a player."
The captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that the big break is not solving.
Thomas Bjorn, a captain of the European team, knows from experience that the lonely stroke in front of the last day's lonely matching tournament for the "Cubek Ryder" doesn't guarantee victory.
The Danish debutted in 1997 at the Valderrama Club field, where the team led by Seva Ballesteros was ahead of the Americans at five points, but it won the game with a small break with the result of 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big stroke in a game in Walderham field; a big break in Brooklyn, where we lost, and the Walderami field where we victoriously," said Bjorn after the victory games of Class 2018 with the results of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at the Le Golf National Stadium, after which the break was 10:6.
So history teaches me and every team player that nothing has yet been resolved.
Tomorrow we have to play with the maximum rate.
Go to the field and do everything necessary.
The game will only be completed after the result appears on the table.
We have a goal to get this trophy, and that's what we want.
As I said before, I'm focusing on the 12 players of our team, but we're aware of who we're standing against, the best players of the world."
Happy of his players in a complex field, Bjorn added, "I'll never run ahead.
Tomorrow things can work differently.
Tomorrow, individual matches are waiting for us, and this is something else.
It's great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but it's just when you're standing there alone, and you can check what you're worth like a golfist.
This is how you should configure the players to play tomorrow: at the boundary of the possibilities.
You leave your partner without support, and now he also has to show what he's capable of."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite number of Jim Furic expects his partners to play a better game at the individual level, except for Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who took three points from four.
Until the Furrick Fate on the last day, he was among the winners in Brooklyn, but he was defeated when the team from Europe created "The Wonder in Medina."
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, a team captain in 1999, organized the players before the last day of the competition.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we need to start successfully as it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves to someone's side, the players in the middle of the distance experience a special pressure.
We put the players in the team as if we were going to do something amazing tomorrow."
Tomas has been assigned to try to run the top match against Rory Macilroy, and then in the first half of the European team, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ian Poulter.
"There are these partners, and in this order, I have chosen because I want to equally distribute efforts throughout the game," Bjorn commented on his choice of players for individual matches.
The introduction of a new German battleship has been reconsidered
The contemporary fregate of Germany's military-motive fleet was to take action in 2014, instead of the old warships of the Cold War Time. However, according to local media information, this will not happen until the next year, at least because of the incorrect systems and the rapid growth of expenditure.
According to the Die Zeit newspaper, which was obtained from a dictionaries of military recruitment, the introduction of the Raineland-Pfaltz ship, the main ship of the most contemporary fregates class "Baden-Wurtemberg" was postponed until the first half of 2019.
This ship was supposed to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that occurred after delivery had damaged the implementation of the ambitious project.
Four ships of the class "Baden-Wurthamberg", which the seamen ordered in 2007, should replace the old fregates of the Bremen class.
Clearly, they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a set of aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as with some technologies of reducing notice, such as radiolocation, infrared, and acustical.
Another important feature is the longer period of technical security, which is expected that new fregats will be able to avoid returning to the basement port for about two years.
However, journalists of Die Zeit warn that, due to continuous delays, overtime warships that would increase Germany’s military power in the sea, the exploitation will also expire.
The F125 multi-personal fregate came into the titles of the newspaper last year when the German military forces officially refused to take the ship into action and returned it to Blohm + Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first case of returning the military ship to the ship construction company after delivery.
The reasons for return are not known, but the German media mentioned significant "software and equipment defects", which caused the battleship to become inappropriate to carry out military operations.
Software deficiencies are particularly important, because the ship crew of the Baden-Wurthamberg class consists of about 120 sailors -- it's only half of the number of military people who served on the old fregates of the Bremen class.
Furthermore, it turns out that the ship has a considerable overweight, which worsens its exploitation characteristics and limits the possibilities for further modernization.
It is considered that the Reinland-Pfalt fregate is twice the weight of 7000 tonnes of the same class that were used by Germans during World War II.
In addition to the incorrect equipment, another problem was the total cost of the project, which also includes the price of the preparation of the crew.
2.2 billion euros were expected to become a massive 3.1 billion euro (U.S.$ 3.6 billion).
The problems of getting new fregates have acquired special weight in light of recent warnings about the decline of Germany's military and marine forces.
At the beginning of the year, the Bundestag of Armed Forces Hans-Peter Bartels announced that in the MS of the country, there are "a few ships to carry out combat tasks".
The official stated that the situation had been severely worsening for a period of time, since the old ships were exploited and the new were not coming.
He expressed his deep regret that none of the fregates of the Baden-Wurthamberg class could fill the marine fleet.
The National Tribute will observe the Secret Life of the Scatters
The new research conducted in the landscape in the Scotland Mountain is intended to set up how bats use landscapes to look for food.
Scientists hope that the data received will help to light on the behavior of these unique flying tissues in the future to take steps from their preservation.
In the gardens of Invery in West Ross, Scientists of the National Trast of Scotland will be watched by species such as pigmeus netopys and pigmea netopy, as well as droughts are common and watery nights.
Special registrators will be placed in strategic locations in the field of landscape to observe the behaviour of bats during the season.
Workers and volunteers of the Scotland National Trast will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
Expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to set the frequency and the privilege of crying.
Then it is planned to develop a detailed map of living animals and prepare a report to link the behaviour to the environment of their lives.
Rob Duar, a Natural Adviser in the Scotland National Trast, hopes that the results of research will help to determine what areas of residence are important and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to evaluate the effectiveness of the ecological care measures (e.g. the formation of bowls) and identify optimal forest saving methods for flatters and other related species.
During the last century, the population of bats was significantly declined in Scotland and Britain.
They are threatened by active construction and conquering territories, which reduces their nest seats.
Other negative factors include wind installation and lighting, fly sticky paper, chemical processing of construction materials, and house cat attacks.
The speakers are not actually blind.
However, by hunting at night, ears are more effective than eyes.
They use a complex echolocation method to detect insects and obstacles on the flight trajectory.
In the National Trast of Scotland, which carries for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens of special importance and 76,000 hectares of earth throughout the country, are seriously dealing with the problems of bats.
Ten specially trained experts are conducting regular research, nest checks, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The efforts of the organization have even been created by the first and only in Scotland for the batlands, and it is located in the Triv area in the Damfris and Galloway area, where eight of the ten species of bats live in Scotland.
David Thompson's managing places claims that this is the perfect place for them.
"In the landscape of the Treasury, there are great conditions for bats," he assures.
"There are old buildings, many giant trees and other favourable living conditions.
But we still need to learn a lot about the bats, and through the research we're doing here and in other places, we can learn more about what they need to be prosperous."
He insists that it is very important to check the territory of batches before performing any technical work, because by unintended destruction of one nest site for youth expelling, 400 female sams can be killed with children, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local population.
The casanics and their nests are protected by law; animals are prohibited to kill, torture or torture.
Elizabeth Ferrell, officer of the Scotland Centre for Conservation, called on the public to join the organization’s efforts.
She said, "We still need to learn a lot about our bats, we have not yet revealed the characteristics of many species."
Ronald rejects the charges of rape, and his lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against German publication
Cristian Ronald called the accusation of being raped by a slaughter and said that people were trying to draw attention to themselves, using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a complaint against the German News Journal of Der Spiegel, which published information on suspicions.
The American Catherine Mayorga accused the Forward of the Collective Portuguese and the Juventus Football Club of rape, which happened in 2009 in the hotel room in Las Vegas.
As the Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday, Ronald seemed to have paid her 375,000 dollars for silence.
A few hours after the prosecution of 33-year-old Ronald turned to 142 million of his advocates in the Instagram video transmission, calling the corresponding message "clear".
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's accusations are a slander," that's the statement made by the five-time master of the Golden Ball on the camera.
"They want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to get on me, but these situations are part of my work.
I am a happy person, and I'm fine, ” added footballist, smiling.
According to the Reuters Information Agency, Ronald's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the prosecution that they called "nearbid suspicion report in the field of private life".
Christian Sherc's lawyer said that the footballist would require compensation for "moral damage in size, which corresponds to the seriousness of a violation, which is probably one of the most loud cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
It's alleged that the incident happened in the Palms Casino hotel in Las Vegas in June 2009.
It is reported that after a meeting at the night club of Ronald and Mayorg returned to the player’s room where he seemed to have been analytically raped, such a testimony was transferred to the district court of Clark, Nevada.
Majorga claims that after Ronald's described incident, he fell on her knees and said he was a "99% good guy" that he was a "one percent" that he had been deducted.
As indicated in the documents, Ronald confirmed that he had sex with a model, but on a double consent.
Mayorga also claims that she turned to the police and then to a hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later, she agreed on the outdoor regulation because she was afraid of revenge and was watching the public humiliation.
Now a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel the previous arrangement, because she continues to suffer from an incident that she said to have happened.
At the time of the event, Ronald was preparing to move to the FC Real Madrid from the FC Manchester United, and this summer he became a player of the Italian football, the Euventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will "forever regret" the loss of autoproducers
Great Britain will "will regret forever" if the world leader's status is lost after Brexit after the Brexit, and that's what the Minister of Economy Greg Clark warns about.
He added that he was excited by the statement of the representatives of Toyota UK who informed BBC journalists that in the event of the exit of Britain from the EU without an agreement, the company would be forced to suspend the production and work of its factory in Bernastone near Derby.
"We need a deal," Minister Clark assures.
The Japanese autoproducer stated that the effects of delays on the border in the case of Brexit without a contract could cost jobs.
In Bernastone, the Toyota models of Auris and Avensis were produced by some 150,000 cars exported to the rest of the European Union last year.
"I think, if Britain expeditiously leaves the EU at the end of March, the production in our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cook, Director-General of Toyota in Bernastone.
Other autoproducers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about how Britain's exit from the EU without an international trade agreement.
For example, the BMW claimed that the mini model factory in Oxford would be closed a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of autoproducers are that Brexit without a contract can cause risks for supply chains.
Toyota’s production line functions in the operational delivery of details and materials according to the need — details come every 37 minutes from British and EU suppliers for cars produced for orders.
If the EU leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there may be breakdowns in the supply of details that will delay and lack of materials.
As the company states, the Toyota storage can be placed for no more than one day, so the production will have to stop.
Greg Clark pointed out that the EU's relationship plan prepared by Teresa May (Chequers Plan) is "except for the schemes of avoiding problems on the border."
"We need a covenant, and we need a optimum agreement that, I think, will allow not only to achieve success in the current moment but also to use the prospects that have come," he said during today's BBC Radio 4.
"In view of the testimony of the Toyota and other autoproducers, we need to save the formed high-efficient supply chains."
In the Toyota company, they couldn't tell how long the production will be stopped, but in a long-term perspective, they expect the increase of costs to reduce the competitiveness of the factory, and as a result, to reduce jobs.
Peter Zuvalaris, head of the Unite Professional Communition of Professional Company in Bernastone, who worked here for 24 years, said that other participants are extremely concerned, "I can say from experience, short jobs are not renewed."
The government's representative said, "We have set up a precise and reliable plan to form our future relationship with the EU."
Tramp and Rosenstein meet can be postponed again, noted in the White House
As the representatives of the White House reported on Sunday, the responsible meeting of Donald Tramp with the Deputy General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred for another week", while discussions on Brett Cavano's candidacy were held on the post of the Supreme Court of Justice.
Rosenstein controls the work of a special prosecutor Robert Muller, investigating Russia's intervention in the election, the link between Tramp and Russia's assistants and the potential obstacle to justice by the President.
During a few months in Washington, there is a discussion about the probability of exemption of a deputy general prosecutor, which would threaten Muller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein said about the use of microphones to record talks with Tramp and the possibility of pre-continuing the president's mandate by 25 amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm that information.
But last Monday, he visited the White House on the background of reports that the official was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Tramp, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was appointed on Thursday.
Tramp stated that "I wouldn't" would have released Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a coincidence in time with the meeting of the Senate Legal Committee, in which Cavano and one of the women were going to testify for sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazey Ford.
On Friday, Tramp ordered a weekly FBI investigation for charges against Cavano, which has further delayed the vote in the Senate.
The press secretary Trampa, Sarah Sanders, spoke at the Fox News Sunday TV show.
When she asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she answered, "The date of the meeting is not designed, it may happen this week, and I expect it to be postponed for another week, given all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I'm keeping watching the press have the last information."
Some journalists disagreed with this: Sanders did not brief for the media in the White House of September 10th.
The leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the frequent briefings were not related to the hostility of the public's television reporters, although she added, "I won't deny that they play public."
Then she assumed that Tramp himself would communicate with the press more.
"The president answers questions more often than any president before him," she added, without referring to the source, "Statistics speaks for himself."
Sanders noted that the briefings would still be done, but "if the press has a chance to ask the President of the United States, it's better than talking to me."
We've been trying to communicate often with the press, which should be particularly visible over the past few weeks, and the possibility of talking to the President of the United States is not worse than the press conference."
Tramp regularly answers the questions during action outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences for the participation of high-level guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why it was so, treating journalists openly and sometimes incredible.
The State Health Secretary of Scotland contacted EU workers in connection with the concerns of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health addressed a letter to other EU citizens who work at the Scotland National Health Service to express their appreciation for their work and ask her to continue after Brexit.
Jin Freeman, a member of the Scotland parliament, sent a letter less than six months prior to the exit of Britain from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already undertaken to cover the value of claims for receiving a permanent displacement status for EU citizens working in autonomous state services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman noted: "In summer, talks between Britain and the EU have continued on the issue of the exit.
However, the British government strengthens the preparation for possible exit without a covenant.
I know that this period may be very anxious for you.
That is why I would like to emphasize again how I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all European Union and countries outside are shared with valuable experiences and skills, strengthening and improving health services for patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we really want you to stay."
Cristion Ebercrombi carried an emergency operation after a head trauma
The Semi-Protector of Tennessee State Tygers Christion Ebercromby has carried an emergency operation after a head injury in the Sunday game against Vanderbilt Comodores, which his team lost with account 31:27, and the reporter told the Tennessean issue.
The Chief Team Coach Tennessee State Tygers told the reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
"He approached the side line where he became sick," said Reid.
On the side line, coaches and medical personnel gave Ebercrombi oxygen before wears took it for further survey.
The official Teenness State Tygers team informed Chris Harris from the WSMV channel, Nashville, Tennessee, that Ebercrombi was operated at the University of Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that "not yet a testimony about the type and severity of injury," in Tennessee State Tygers, they're trying to find out when the player got injured.
Ebercromby, second-course, spent his first season in Tennessee State Tygers after moving from the Ellinois team.
He performed five ball captures on Sunday before he got out of the game, so he's got 18 captures in the season.

In the Ministry of Finance, additional 120 million pounds per year are expected to be included in the Ministry of Finance for helping homeless
As Teresa May announced today, foreigners buying real estate in Britain will pay more bribes, and additional funds will be spent on helping homeless people.
This step can be considered as an attempt to neutralize the efforts of Jeremy Corbin to involve young voters in promises to offer more accessible housing for high - paid workers.
The increase in the bribe will apply to physical and legal persons who do not pay taxes in Britain, and the government will provide additional funds to help those who have to sleep under the open heavens.
Further bribe accompanied by an increase in the duration of the second apartment and immunity for renting may be three percent.
In the Ministry of Finance, additional 120 million pounds per year are expected to be included.
According to experts, 13% of the new real estate that is built in London is in possession of foreign citizens, which leads to increased prices and complicated tasks for those who just dream about their own apartment.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, are deserted, since a large number of foreign buyers live most of their time outside the country.
The new plan of action appeared only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called on to reduce the state bribes to make the apartment more accessible for young people.
He accused large construction companies of supporting high prices of immunity by buying land without further use, and he called on Teresa May to give up quotas to the available immunity to correct the "happy situation on the housing market" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of important real estate reforms, including rental control and failure to expulsion without reason.
He also suggests that local councils in the area of building a new home.
Teresa May said, "I promised last year that I would devote my prime ministership to the reconstruction of the British dream -- for every new generation of life should be better.
This requires changes in our imperfect housing market.
Great Britain will always remain open for those who want to live, work and build their future here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in Britain and foreign companies buy accommodation under the same conditions as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own apartment has become unattainable, and the problem of living under the open sky is still very painful."
Jack Ross: "After all, I want to be the chief coach of Collective Scotland."
The chief coach of the FC Sunderland, Jack Ross, claims that " above all he wants" is ever headed by the Scotland Collective.
The 42-year-old Scotch went to renew the north-east club of the country, which is currently in the first football league, three points away from the leader.
Ross moved to the Station of Light this summer, returning the last season of St. Merren to the Prime Minister of Scotland.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to the second collective Scotland, but that's the end of it," Ross said during the Sportsound program at the BBC Scotland radio station.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the game of the Collective Scotland at the Hampden Park Stadium, which always attracted me.
The only hope for me is to be successful at the post of the chief coach of the club."
Ross' precedents at the FC Sanderland were Dick Lawyer, David Mys, Sam Ellardays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kin, Gustavo Poet and Paolo Di Kanio.
Former coach of the FC Alloa Atletics claims that he didn't feel anxious about moving into a big club following such superior names, previously rejecting the proposals from the FC Barnsley and Ipswick Town.
"In the current stage, I'll think it's successful if the club returns to the Premier League.
Thanks to its structure and materially-technological security, this club is undoubtedly equal to the Premier League," he said.
"It's gonna be a difficult task, but another result I'm hardly going to think it's a success for myself."
Ross's only been building a training career for three years, and he was working as a second trainer at the FC Dumbarton, and he spent 15 months in the FC headquarters.
Then he helped Alloa recover after the FC got into the third division, and the next season from St. Merren went the way from the flying stage to the winners of the first division.
Ross says now he feels more comfortable than ever during his game career at the FC Clyde, Gartlpool, Folkerk, St. Merren and Hamilton Academycal.
"I'm on a roadway," he recalls, talking about the transition to the FC "Alloa."
"I sincerely believed that training was more suitable to me than a game.
That sounds strange because I was successful, well earned and reached some heights.
But it's very difficult to play.
There are many difficulties to deal with each week.
I still face them with stress and stress, but as a chief coach, I feel in my own place.
I've always been interested in the training work, and I've never felt as comfortable as my adult life as after I've chosen this job."
The full interview will be available on the Sportsound transmission on Sunday, September 30th, on radio station Radio Scotland from 12:00 till 1:00 in the British summer time.
Study: 17:30 Sunday is a perfect time for a pile of beer
The summer heat has helped to increase the delivery to British pubs who survive not the best times, but increased the pressure on the restaurants network.
According to the sales calculations in pubs and bars in July, 2.7% increased, while the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, author of the CGA organization, consulting business development, said: "With solar weather and longer than expected, the participation of England in the World Championship, July passed by the same scheme as the previous month when the pub delivery grew by 2.8%, and the restaurants went even worse.
The red fall by 1.8% in July increased.
Pabs and bars focused on drinking, while they have the best rates — their profit growth is equal to the loss of restaurants.
Pabs with food also suffered from heat, but not as much as restaurants.
Looks like the visitors are only interested in drinking.
In the surveillance pubs and bars of selling drinks a month, 6,6 per cent increased, and the sale of food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst of the Division for Authentication and Goal Business in RSM, said, "We see similar trends from the end of April.
Weather and scale social or sports events remain the main factors that affect the sale on the internal market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups continue to lose their profits.
A long hot summer has not come up at the best time for food plants, and we'll see if a more moderate temperature we've seen in August, give them such a necessary rest."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new establishments, was 2.7% in July, which reflects the slowdown of the withdrawal to the market of new brands.
The gallose indicator of the sales of Coffer Peach Tracker in the pubs, bars and restaurants of Britain is the reflection of the collected and analysed productivity rates of 47 working groups, the total of which is exceeding 9 billion pounds of sterlings. This is a generally accepted branch standard.
Every fifth child has a social network account hidden from parents
According to the research results, every five child, sometimes aged 11 years old, has an account hidden from parents and teachers in social networks.
Study of 20,000 students in high school showed an increase in the number of fictional pages in Instagram
This news has increased concern about the possible placement of sexual nature
20% of the students reported that they had a basic account that showed to their parents
Every fifth child, sometimes aged 11 years old, creates an account in social networks that hides from adults.
The study of 20,000 students in high school showed an increase in the number of fictional pages in Instagram, the social network for photo exchange.
This news raised anxiety about the possible placement of sexual nature.
20% of the students reported that they had a clean "core" account that showed their parents and one or more private.
The mother who ran into the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw the call "from me."
The study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistress Conference (HMC) in private schools showed that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles in social networks. Half of these children recognized that the additional account was secret.
The head of the HMC Association, Mike Buchanan, said, "We are very concerned about the fact that many teenagers feel the desire to create a online space where parents and teachers can't find them."
Alyd Doyle will become a athlete's representative in the Scottish Athletics Council
Alyd Doyle is chosen in the Scottish Athletics Council as an independent director during the annual general government meetings.
Doyle is a scotland’s scotland’s flavour, and the head of Yen Beatty called this step a great opportunity for those who are leading the sports movement to use its broad experience at the international level during the last decade.
"Alyde uses great respect among Scotland, Britain and the world athletes, and we are convinced that when it comes to a council, the sports sports in Scotland will be of great benefit," Beatti assured.
Doyle said, "I will be inspired to act as a athlete's representative, and I hope I can really benefit and promote sports in Scotland."
The American, a four - time olympic champion who won 200 and 400 - meters in the games in the Atlanta in 1996, and now the Sports Watcher for BBC, lost the possibility of walking through a transitory ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter, "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors argued that only time would show if I could recover and how much.
Incredible efforts helped me to recover completely, and I learned to walk and to do dynamic exercise today!
Thank you for the words of support!"
In the advertising of the milk sucker of women compared to cows, the ideas of Internet users were divided
The manufacturer of milk suckers struck with an unequivocal response of Internet users to a advertisement that compares young mothers to real cows.
To mark the release of the product called the first silent milk smoker in the world, the Technology-Producer of Consumers Elvie produced an advertisement in the style of a humoristic music video to demonstrate the freedom that the mothers provide a new smoker.
Four real mothers dance in a song filled with the bean, which contains the words, "Yes, I feed myself, but I don't have my tail," and "As you see, it's not my breast."
And then the choir sings, "Smoke, smoke to feed the children, smoke, smoke so that the milk doesn't waste."
However, the advertising film published on the Facebook page caused a violent online discussion.
The video has obtained 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the response of the Internet users has proved uncertain, and many have noted that the advertisement is underestimated by the "worst organisation" of milk production in the industry.
"It's not a very reasonable decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and be born to give milk, but their children are taken badly from them a few days after their birth," wrote one of the users.
Elvie's milk-smoker can be easily hid in a nutrition busthalter (Elvie/Mother)
Here's another comment, "I realized it's traumatic both for mother and for the child.
But why don't you incorporate them to advertise the milk smoker for women who need to feed their babies?"
Someone else added, "This advertisement is very far from reality."
Other users have been defending the advertisement, and one of the women's videos seemed "very cheerful."
"I think that's a brilliant idea.
I would certainly have bought this thing if I still feeded her breasts.
When I smoked milk, I felt really like a cow.
The advertisement is kind of crazy, but I didn't look for a hidden sense in it.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "Common advertisement, focused on mammys who suck milk, often at work or in the bathroom, and they feel like cows.
This advertisement is not aimed at enlightening breast industry's advantages and shortcomings."
At the end of the video, women show the milk smokers hidden in their bousthalters.
The concept of the advertising campaign is based on information that many women who use such products feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s smoker is working absolutely quietly, has no wire or pipes, and easily hides in a nutrition rubber, and so women can freely move, keep children, and even walk out of the street.
Anne Balarin, a partner and an executive creative director of Mother's advertising agency, commented this situation: "The Elvie smoker is so revolutionary that he demanded a bright and provocational representation.
After conducting a parallel between women who crush milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the characteristics of breast production, in a fascinating and interesting way by demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that a new smoker brings.
Elvie's smoker is not the first time in the news heads.
In London's Sunday Fashion, the mother of two children appeared at the stage with this product while showing clothes from Marta Jacobska modeler.
Thousands of migrants were quietly moved to the tent city on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has grown sharply, although the number of monthly crossings of the border remained relatively unchanged, partly because the cruel rhetoric and politics of the Trampa administration have complicated the process of disposal of children.
In most cases, carers were acting by immigrants without documents, and now they are afraid to put their own possibility to stay in the country by offering responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential careers and other adult members of their households would be obliged to provide fingerprints and that these data will be transferred to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albans, the High Chief of the Bureau for Immigration and Customs Control, testified before the Congress that the Bureau’s colleagues arrested dozens of people who filed requests for care for minors without accompanied.
Later, the Bureau confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no criminal history.
"Nearly 80 percent of those who are carers or members of their households are illegally in the country, many of them are foreigners who have committed wrongdoing.
So we continue to persecute these people," Mr. Albance said.
According to the asylum workers, in order to address children's matters, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of the children to appear before the court within a month after the detention, not in 60 days as they were before.
Many of them will be able to use a video conference link, not to come to court personally to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who do not have the right to receive a shelter will be deported quickly.
According to the asylum workers and official data from responsible officials in the past months, the longer the children remain under custody, the more likely they will feel anxiety or depression, which may cause violence or attempts to escape.
Protecters claim that these problems are increased in the establishments of greater size, such as Thornilo, where the psychological status of children is more difficult.
They added that by moving the children to the tent and not giving enough time to prepare emotional or farewell with friends, we risk increasing the injury that many of them have already experienced.
Syria ordered the United States, France and Turkey to expel the troops immediately
Furthermore, speaking to the UN General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Valid al-Mualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country has been at war for eight years.
Mualem, who also works as a Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian land under terrorism, so "them will be appropriate."
"They must go immediately and not put conditions," he stated at the Assembly.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is actually finished" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He stated that Damascus would continue "this holy battle until we cleared all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "be some illegal foreign presence."
The U.S. has placed about 2,000 military officers in Syria, and mostly they teach and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who act against President Bashar Al-Asad.
More than 1,000 soldiers were sent to a desolate country by France.
With regard to refugees, Mualem assured that the country has created proper conditions for their return, and he also accused some Western countries that they're "promoting unreasonable fears" that the fugitives do not dare return.
"We encouraged international society and humanitarian organizations to promote people to return," he said.
"We see the attempt to politicize a whole humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warn that they will not assist Syria in renewing the country until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition of the ending of war is established.
The UN diplomats will report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey about the creation of a buffer zone around Idlib, the last large salary of the rebels, created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian and Turkish agreement has made it possible to prevent the massive attack of Syrian forces supported by Russia from a province where three million people live.
But Mualm emphasized that the covenant has "tough terms" and expressed hope that military action will be directed against dżihadists, including fighters associated with Al-Qaid Front an-Nousra, who will "be destroyed".
The UN emissor Staffan de Missoura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of the new committee to which government and opposition representatives will enter in to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
Muallem provided conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that his work should be limited by "preview of the articles of the proper constitution", and warned about intervention.
Why Trampa will be redeployed
According to this logic, Trampa can be reconverted in 2020, if many liberal viewers are likely expected, it will not be authorized in advance after scandal and impeachment.
No doubt it would be the "dramatic ending of the presidency all the time"!
At the moment the watches do not provide signs of tiredness.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in the Prime-Time has doubled (to 1.05 million) on CNN channel and has actually tripled (to 1.6 million) on MSNBC channel.
According to Nilsen, the Fox News averaged 2.4 million Prime-time viewers, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the The Rachel Maddow Show on the MSNBC cable channel was at the top of 3.5 million viewers at the evening when the main news was discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's beyond our understanding," said Nil Ber, the executive producer of the Drama "The last candidate" on the ABC channel on the Secretary of State, who becomes president of the destructive attack on Capitolia.
Nell Squall, an experienced writer-humorist and a writer of the book "There's only funny moments: and a few strict truths about entering the Hollywood men club" offers another theory.
She remembered her trip to Boston’s taxi before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he would vote for Tramp.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he's making me laugh," he said, "it's the story that Mrs. Scowell told me.
Chaos is having fun.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, Washington's stories are able to determine the future of Row's affairs against Wade, the possibility of reunification of immigrant families and the state of the world economy.
The disposal is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you can't say that you're just trying to stay informed by citizens when you watch six hours the expert group discusses the use of Bob Woodward's "best familiar" sources for your "Scare" book, Paul Manforth's jacket for $15,000's skin, so it was written in the Washington Post, and the consequences of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Tramp's anatomy published by Stormy Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never become a former man again.
"The sense of reality show is partly related to the fact that you have something new every evening," said Brent Montgomery, the chief executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the television program "The Lombard Stars", about the rotation in the actor's warehouse and the daily turnings in the Tramp show (conflict with NFL, support for Kim Chen Ina).
If you afford to miss one episode, you can unbelievablely retire.
When I met Mr. Flace this week at his home on the north coast of Cauai, there was a warm sun weather (27 degrees by Celsius), but he was sitting at home looking at MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn’t get away from the TV — not when Brett Cavano stood before the Legal Committee of the Senate, and the future of the Supreme Court was hanged on the hair.
"I remember how we used to make all those crazy shows, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flace told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they seemed to be right."

External inflammation of funds in the most brightest intermediate elections to the Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is directed by additional cash inflammation, because two electoral congressmen compete for one chair through the borders of the electoral districts.
In the fight for this Priest region of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been modified, a democrat member of the Connor Lemb Palace, who won a victory in another district at the additional elections of last spring.
Lemb stands against another proper congressman, the Republican of Kit Rothfs, who now represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders are significantly in line with the new 17th.
The maps were reconstructed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court adopted the decision that the old borders of the regions were designed for the benefit of the Republicans against the Constitution.
The pre-electoral race in the new 17th district caused a severe opposition between the financial divisions of the main parties, the United States Democratic Party Committee for Congress elections (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
Lamba's name became very famous in Pennsylvania after winning the 18th district with the minimum advantage during additional elections in the Congress in March, which used a wide range of public attention.
This place belonged to the Republicans over a decade, and President Donald Tramp won the 20 - points victory in this district.
Political experts have given a small advantage to democrats.
In the United States, El Salvador’s penalty for China’s support was considered, but they changed their minds
The diplomats reminded of a weak resistance by Washington on the action of the Dominican Republic and Panama, who had previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Tramp held a warm meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varel, and before Tramp had a hotel in Panama until the partners rented the Trump Organization.
The officials of the State Department decided to revoke US diplomatic mission leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama through "the recent decisions on the non-recognition of Taiwan", said the press secretary of the Department of Gezer Noiert at the beginning of this month.
However, the sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, who received about $140 million of US aid in 2017, including in the field of drug control, and in support of social and economic development.
Suggested fines that predicted a reduction in financial assistance and target limitation on the issue of visas would be painful for this country of Central America with its high level of unemployment and murder.
As a result of internal meetings, landlords from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference, dedicated to security and economic prosperity, and was considered a step forward in the efforts to restrain the flow of migrants in the United States.
But by mid September, the high-level representatives of the administration have found out what they want the conference to be held, and in fact, the question of sanctions against El Salvador has stopped.
According to diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pens is now planning to present a conference, which is assigned in the middle of October, in a sign that the administration considers this Western very important.
Three American messengers were quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic because there were no new hard messages or punishments by Washington.
The representative of Mr. Bolton in the White House refused to comment on the details of the interior discussions reported by three American officials, two of whom were diplomats, under the conditions of anonymity.
The information given to them confirmed by a foreign analyst close to the administration, which also spoke under the conditions of anonymity.
Study History
Another problem may be the report of the Special Prosecutor Robert Muller of the possible obstacle to justice by Tramp, a strong confirmation of why we can find in the public information available now.
In his investigation, Muller has reportedly checked the possible link between Tramp's campaign and the attack on our voting system by Russia.
If the influence in the Congress goes into other hands, Trampo will have to report to the congressmen, as well as to the voters and, eventually, the one - participants.
In this case, a lot of "if," and I don't want to say that the fall of Tramp is inevitable, like his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will determine the duration of the fight.
In 1938 the German officers were willing to set up a state revolt against Hitler if only the West began to resist him and supported Czechoslovakia in München.
We failed and lost the possibility of avoiding bloodshed.
The history move is determined by such fractures, and democracy’s inconsistent movement is accelerating or slowing.
The Americans are waiting for a few of these moments.
What will we do if Tramp releases the Deputy General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the person that depends on Mr. Muller's fate?
Rosenstein's been in trouble since this newspaper came up with the information that he offered to record a secret conversation with the president last year and shared thoughts about the incompatibility of the Trampa position.
Rosenstein said that information in the The Times was incorrect.
"How do we react if the investigation in the case against Brett Cavano, which recently started by the FBI, turns out not to be genuine or honest or if Cavano candidate for post in the Supreme Court approve, despite convincing accusations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And first of all, will we in the mid-term prospects vote for those members of the Congress that will be able to bring Tramp to responsibility?
If we fail these trials, democracy will come to evil times.
But I believe we won't fail because of the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Slovak Jewish woman deported in Auschwitz the same Nazi regime as my Ambassador’s house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to burn sabbath candles on the swastic table.

Graham Dorrance from Rangers with optimism is waiting for a meeting with Vienna Rapid.
FK Rangers takes Rapid on Thursday, after an impressive Night in Spain in a game with "Williareal" at the beginning of this month, the Scotland Club will provide a good chance to get out of the G League of Europe.
Because of the knee trauma, the semi-protector Gram Dorrans was able to play for the first time in the season only in a game with Williamreal, which ended with account 2:2. But he believes that the FK Rangers can use this as a tramplin to achieve a greater.
"For us, this was a good result, because "Williarreal" is a strong team," said 31-year-old player.
"We went to the game with hope to get something and got one point.
Maybe at the end of the game, we could go forward, but the general could be seen as a fair result.
In the first time, the opponent was better, but after the break, we fixed the situation for our benefit.
On Thursday, there will be another important opposition in the League of Europe.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be difficult, and our future rivals showed a good outcome in their last game, but we can count on supporting the infectants, and I'm sure we can give a fight and get a positive result.
Last year, it was definitely difficult, starting from my injuries and ending with changes in the club itself, but now the situation has been normal.
We have a great warehouse, and all the boys are happy.
I hope we can go on, leave behind the past season and make it a success."
Women lose their sleep because of fear of retirement savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea how they would like to organize care for themselves, few have spoken about it with their family members.
About half of the people involved in the research of the Nationwide company said that they talked to their husband or wife about the value of long - term care.
Only 10 percent of the respondents talked about this with the children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't hurry to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationwide Insurance Unit.
That's what we need to begin.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: Your family will not be able to provide you with the necessary care if you don’t tell your wishes to your relatives in advance.
Consult your consultant and your family to determine where and how to get care, because this choice can be an important factor in determining the value.
Include a financial advisor: He can advise how to cover the costs.
Manufacturing sources of long - term care include traditional insurance policy, hybrid life insurance policy, or self - supplies on your own costs (conditions that you have money).
Prepare carefully legal documents: This will enable you to avoid a legal welfare in advance.
Prepare confidence for your representative who will control your medical services and keep your experts on your wishes if you can’t do so personally.
Furthermore, we recommend that we provide confidence in the settlement of money.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay accounts if you are inactivated.

In Ilfracum, a man shot a few times from a plunger gun
A man had a few shots from a plunger gun when he returned home from the party.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracum, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, stomach and arm.
The officers described the shooting that took place at 2:30 after the British summer time as "random".
The sufferer didn't see the attacker.
His wounds are not a threat to life, but the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonezian city of Palo on Friday, but the number of victims could rise.
Because of the system of communications, officials dealing with humanitarian assistance can't get any information from the Dongal regent, the northern region of Palo, which is closer to the epicentre of the Magnitude of 7.5 points.
After a natural disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palo.
Consider some of the basic facts about the city of Palo and Dongal regency on the island of Sulaves.
Palo is the capital of the Central Sulavesa province, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of Sulavesi, with the oriental population of 379 800 people according to the 2017 data.
When the earthquake, which caused tsunami, the city celebrated its 40th year.
Dongala is a regency that extends more than 300 miles (180 miles) along the coast line in the northwest of Sulaves.
According to the 2017 regency, the administrative region located at the bottom of the province, is about 299 200 people.
Fishing and agriculture are the main areas of provincial economy, Central Sulavesi, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
The nucleus is also important in the province, but mainly focused in Morowal, on the opposite coast of Sulaves.
According to the Indonesian agency for the mitigation of the effects of natural disasters in the past 100 years, Pala and Dongala have suffered from tsunami several times.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in Dongala’s tsunami and hundreds of houses were destroyed.
In 1996, tsunami also covered the west part of Dongal, and then nine people died.
Indonesia is located in a seismically active Pacific fire ring and is regularly suffering from earthquakes.
A few of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis are listed below in the last few years.
2004: 26 December, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Acheg, located in the north of Sumatra, caused tsunami, which hit 14 countries, resulting in the death of 226 000 people along the Indian coast of the Indian Ocean, a larger half of them in the province of Acheg.
2005: At the end of March at the beginning of April, a series of powerful earthquakes crashed on the west coast of Sumatra.
Thousands of people died in the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake of the magnitude of 6,8 points smashed south of Java, the most inhabited island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that crashed on the southern coast, resulting in death of about 700 people.
2009: Near the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra Province, detected an earthquake by 7.6 points.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The earthquake of 7.5 points collapsed one of the Mentawai islands located near Sumatra, causing tsunami to a height of 10 meters, which resulted in decades of villages destroyed and killed about 300 people.
2016: The weak earthquake slipped on the regentity of Podjiya in the Acheg province, causing destruction and panic that people have not yet forgotten the ruining earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died under the fractures of buildings.
2018: Many earthquakes have risen on the island of Lombok in Indonesia, resulting in more than 500 deaths, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed many houses, and thousands of tourists could not leave the island immediately.

The track of Paylin, the older son of the former Governor of Alaska, and the candidate for the post of Vice-President Sarah Paleen, was arrested for the assault charge.
According to the report published on Saturday by the Alaska police report of 29-year-old Paylin from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence and accused of impeding the report of violence and resisting during arrest.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report about possible crimes, he picked up her phone.
According to KTUU, Paylin is in custody in the Matanuska-Susitna's executive isolator with the right to bring a flag of $500.
He was in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent" when he was asked if he confessed his guilt, reported on the network.
Peylin is accused of three offences of class A, which predicts arrest for a year to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He's also accused of the offences of class B, which is punished by the day of imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time that Paylin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Palene, called the police and reported the possible attack.
The case is now on the Court of Veterans of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, as well as that he interfered with the reporting of domestic violence and wearing weapons in the state of alcoholic drunkenness when this incident happened.
His girlfriend said he hit her face.
In 2016, Sarah Paylin was discovered by the veteran groups for excusing her son’s violent act of post - traumatic stress disorder after Iraq’s service.
In Indonesia, the earthquake caused tsunami: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulaves on Friday.
The earthquake of the magnitude of 7.5 points caused tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The networks of communications and electricity are out of line, and the number of victims may grow in the next few days.
The earthquake took place near the center of Sulavesi, located northeast of the capital of Jacques.
The video spreading in social networks shows a moment when the nature hits.
Thousands of people gathered to a festival on the beach of Palo, when tsunami crashed on the shore.
Federal Prosecutors require a rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist in New York.
In New York, federal prosecutors demand the death penalty of Saipullo Saipov, suspected in the New York terror, resulting in eight deaths — a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for federal crime since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov, rented at Home Depot Picapa, went on a bicycle road along the West Side road, downtown Manhattan, and began to beat bikemen and footsteps that were happening to him on his way.
According to the report on the intention of being executed in the Southern County of New York to reason the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Sayip's "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries.
According to judicial materials, each of these charges envisages the possibility of a death punishment.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Judges has charged Saipov for 22 items, including eight murder charges, for the purpose of a requirement, which the federal prosecutors generally raised in matters related to organised crimes, as well as the accusations of violence and the destruction of the car transport.
According to prosecutors who described the crime committed by Sayip as "surprising, cruel and incredible," this attack is the result of "real planning and intentionally thought."
The victims that Saifullah Habibulaevic Saipov caused injuries, caused or killed, were Diego Enrique Angeline, Nicolas Cleves, Ann Laura Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferrui, Ernan Diego Mendos and Alejandro Damian Pagnukko, as described in the report of the purpose.
Five dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern County of New York has been violated for the last time a criminal case was punished by a death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of killing two drug suppliers, and finally sentenced to eternal prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty for a federal case was carried out in New York in 1953, a couple of Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs were executed after they were sentenced for conspiracy for spying on the benefit of the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 1953.
According to the case materials of Saipov, the birther of Uzbekistan did not show the reproach of conscience in the coming days and months after the attack.
According to police officers, he told the investigator that he did not regret what he had done.
According to the Act of Prosecution, Saipov informed the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the video attacks of IDILs that he was watching on his phone.
The police reported that he also asked to hang the IDIL flag in his hospital room.
He did not recognize himself guilty of charge for 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were "very disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to pursue a death punishment instead of accepting the confession of guilt and condemning an eternal prison without the possibility of exemption, will only increase the psychological injury caused by these events," said Patton.
Similarly, the Saipov Protection Party asked the prosecutors not to seek death penalty.
The parliamentary deputy of the Conservative Party believes that the NAYGEL FARAGEE needs to be appointed responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during the protest at the Conservative Party's meeting, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the People's Army."
Former leader of the United Kingdom Party's Independence Party stated that politicians should "sense pressure" of Europeans, because one of the parliamentary deputies of Teresa May offered their candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
The Deputy of the Conservative Party, Peter Bown, stated to march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have already come out if Mr. Farage had been the Secretary of Brexit.
Attention to the problems that May faced, trying to reconcile her deeply broken lines, even more attracted the fact that the deputies from the Conservative Party who act against the exit joined a special protest in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is trying to make a compromise plan of Chequers, despite the attacks of Brexit, those against the exit, and the EU.
The allies insist that she will not leave trying to deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and make eurosceptics and layborists choose between what she offers and the chaos.
At the Leave Means Leave in Solihala, Mr. Bone said he wanted to "reject Chequers."
He invited Mr. Faraju to leave the shadows and to take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible for it, we'd have already gone," he said.
The parliamentary ambassador, Welllingboro, added, "I'll support Brexit, but we need to give up Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We fought in world wars not to be subjected.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the assumption that after the vote of 2016, the public thought changed, "The idea that the British changed their minds and did not want to go out, is absolutely unreal."
A member of the Conservative Party and the advocate of Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, said to the reporters, "I'm just saying, "Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the broad public, opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not supported by our party and our activists who actually walk through the streets and fight for votes of voters.
Please dismiss Chequers and start listening."
In turn to Teresa May, she added, "The Prime Ministers keep their position when they do their promises."
Mr. Farage said that politicians should "sense pressure" if they're going to give up the decision taken at the referendum of 2016.
"It is now a matter of confidence between us, people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say that they won't get away with it."
In the report to the enthusiasm of the crowd, he added, "I want our political elite that plans to betray the idea of Brexit to feel pressure.
We mobilize the people's army of this country that will lead us to the Brexit victory and never calm down until we become an independent, self-dependent, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the opponents went to Birmingham and then held a two - hour miting in the center of the city.
Several activists were waving with the Brexit Conservatories after starting the group this weekend.
The Leiborist Lord Adonis laughed at the conservators because after the opening of the conference, their party program had caused security problems.
"These are people who tell us that they can use IT systems and technologies necessary for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"It's a full farce.
There's nothing good in Brexit," he added.
Warren plans seriously to think about talking to the president's post.
The U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the elections in November, she'd "make seriously think of the president's ballot."
The Boston Globe reports that the representative of the Democratic Party from Massachusetts told her future on Saturday during the general congregations in West Massachusetts.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trampo, is flying in November on the second term against a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Dill, who was a co-head of the Tramp campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is considered as a major candidacy that can combat Tramp in 2020.
On Saturday the 36th meeting was held with the general congregations in the form since Tramp got in position.
The attendant asked her if she was planning to participate in presidential elections.
Warren said, "Well, it's time for women to go to Washington and fix the government's work, and for that, there's a woman in his head."
The suspect's been arrested for the murder of a basketball basketballist LAU Tigers.
At the Baton Rouge Police, Louisiana, Saturday was reported that a suspect was arrested on Friday for the murder of a basketball basketballist of LSU Tigers, Wade Simms.
The Baton Rouge Police Office announced an arrest of 20-year-old Ditton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. in eastern time.
On Friday, they published a video shooting with a request to help recognise a person on it.
The 20-year-old Simms was shot at the University of Southern on Friday morning.
"Wade Simms got fire wounds in the head and died as a result," said Mr. Murphy Paul, head of the police of Murphy J. Paul, on Saturday, to journalists 247sports.
Wade set up for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result, the interrogation found that Simpson was at the crime scene, had guns with him and shot Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and arrested in the police office of East Baton County.
Sims, which grew six feet and six inches, and was in the youth league, grew up in Baton Rouge, and he played 32 games with 10 stars in the past season and spent a average of 17.4 minutes on the field, collecting 5.6 points and 2.9 picks.
Granpri Russia: Louis Hamilton reduced restraints in fighting the world's championship after the team decided to give him a victory on Sebastian Fettel
Since the Saturday, Walter Bothas left behind Louis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes’ command decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas was starting well from the pool-pozins and almost rounded by Hamilton, who tried to keep his position on the first two turns and gave Fettel the opportunity to attack his companion by the team.
Fettel went to the pit stop first and left Hamilton on the track in the tail of the race, which had to solve everything.
The Mercedes team pilot passed another circle and went behind the Fettel, but Hamilton ran into leaders after a maneuver with a wheel to the wheel, which led Ferrari to leave the inside space because of the risk that he's overwhelmed, after the result of a double maneuver, he managed to get forward on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back of the grid and stayed on the seventh place until the end of the first circle.
Pot led the majority of the race because he did not change his tyre to come to the finish and put Kimmy Rikkonan out of the fourth place.
As a summary, he stopped on the pit stop on the 44th circle, but he couldn't make it up to the last eight, so Rickkonen sat the fourth seat.
"It's a tough day, because Waltery set up on the full on all weekends and showed nobleness when he gave me the opportunity to go through.
The team has performed an unusual job to possess the first and second place," said Hamilton.
The Tongue of the Body
On Saturday's meeting, President Donald Tramp laughed at Senator Diane Finstein for her firm position that she did not announce the contents of Christine Blaze Ford, accusing the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano for sexual violence.
During the west Virginia mything, the president did not speak directly to the testimony given by Ford before the Senatu Legal Committee, and instead expressed his opinion on the events in the Senate, which he said, as he said, demonstrated human "husband, nasty and liar."
"The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful things that are happening in the Senatu's last few days -- is anger, you see the wicked people who show violentness, disgusting and lying," he said.
"You're looking at publications and public information, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Finnstein, have you been reporting the information?
Recall her answer: “What?
Oh, no.
I did not announce."
Wait a minute.
We advertise?... no, we didn't,” he added, copying the behavior of the senator.
In July, Finnstein received a letter with a detailed interpretation of the Fords against Cavano, and in early September, its content was declared, but Phinestein denyed that the information was released in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't announce the information received from it," said the Fynstein Committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I didn't break my promise."
However, her objection seemed to be disliked by the president who commented on Saturday's mything, "I'll tell you, the language of her body wasn't impressed at all.
Maybe she didn't do it, but I haven't seen anyone sticking worse."
Continuing to defend a candidate to the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual violence, the president assumed that democrats were using charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to restore power in any necessary way.
You can see the rudeness, the embarrassment, they don't care who to offend, who must be offended to get power and control," Mediaite quotes the president's words.
Ellite League: "Dandy Stars" is Belfast Jayants, 5:3
The Jayants player Patrick Duyer put two squads in a game against Dundee.
"Dandy Stars" were rehabilitated for the Friday defeat in the elite League of Belfast Jayants, winning a match on Saturday with account 5:3.
"Jayants" got the early advantage in two shaibes because of Patrick Duyer and Francis Bovillier's drops.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney compared the account in the home game, and then Dwighter reiterated the Jayants.
The Dandi player François Bushar compared the account, and two of Lucas Lundwald Nilsen's goals provided their victory.
This is the third in the season of the elite League, the defeat of Adam Kiff's team, who won a voluntary victory over Dundi with account 2:1 on Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth meeting of the teams in the season, three previous matches won the Jayants team.
The first shibe of Duyer dropped on the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFoll was transferred, and four minutes later, Boville, who received a shib from David Rezerford, doubled the account.
After the tense first period of the fourteenth minute (13:10) Sullivan returned the householders to the game, and at the sixteenth minute (15:16) Cooney, receiving a score from Matt Markwardt, compared the account.
Dwighter's preferred "Jayants" before the first break, dropping his second squirt at the end of the first period.
The masters of the field regrouped, and Bouchar (27:37) again compared the account by dropping the squirrel when his team had overwhelmed.
Thanks to Coney and Charles Corcoran Nilsen's efforts at the end of the second period, he first made the Dundi forward and provided his team's victory in the fifth half of the last period.
Friday's Jayants team, who's already lost four of the five last matches, will play a trip game against Milton-Kines.
Aviation Controller died so that hundreds of people on the plane could avoid earthquake
Aviation controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he helped fly a plane with hundreds of people.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after a strong earthquake that caused tsunami on the island of Sulaves on Friday.
The strong underground strike continues to shake this area, and many people are under the ruins in Palo.
However, unlike their colleagues, who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the dispatch tower, which was highly dissolved at the Mutiara SIS Al-Juffrey airport in Palo.
He stayed there to make sure that a flight of 6321 of the Batik Air air, which was at the time on the landing railway, has risen safely in the air.
Then he jumped out of the Dispatch Tower when he thought it was ruined.
Later he died in the hospital.
The representative of the Indonesian airline supplier, Johannes Syryte, said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian ABC News Agency.
We prepared a helicopter from Ballipapan to Kalimantan, which should be delivered to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palo.
"We're very sorry to hear about it," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the number of victims can reach thousands, because the agency claims that access to the towns of Dongal, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The number of victims may rise because many bodies are still under fractions and many of them cannot be reached," said the representative of the Sutopo Purvo Nugrocho Agency.
The waves of the height reached six meters have desolated the city of Palo, where mass funerals will take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft provide help and food.
Rizza Kusum, 35-year-old mother, told Sky News, "A quick help brings bodies every minute.
The clean water is missing.
The mini-markets are robbed everywhere."
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Helfand, told CNN, "Red Indonesia Cross is hurrying to help people who have experienced this tragedy, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
President of the Indonesia Joco Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and said to the military officers of the country, "I ask you all to work day and night to perform all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?", says CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was affected by earthquakes in Lomboc Island, which resulted in more than 550 deaths.
Aviation accident in Micronesia: As stated in Air Niugini, after a plane crashed in the lagoon, one man disappeared from the wirelessness
Aviation company that carried out a flight in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one person disappeared without awareness, although previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were well evacuated from the drowning plane.
Air Niugini stated that Saturday’s state was not able to find one passenger.
The airline reports that its representatives are trying to find a husband and cooperate with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for more information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
The local boats helped to save other passengers and teams after the plane fell on the water when he tried to land at the island Chuk airport.
On Friday, the officials reported that seven men were delivered to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all stable.
The cause of the disaster and the exact sequence of events is unknown.
In the airlines and the U.S.A. stated that the plane landed in the lagoon near the landing trail.
Some witnesses believe that the plane flyed over the landing trail.
The American passenger, Bill Janes, said that the plane flyed very low over the earth.
"It's very good," said Janes.
Janes told me he and others had been able to go to emergency exits on a thin plane by a belt in the water.
He said that the stewardes paniced and screamed, and that he got a light head trauma.
The U.S.A. reported that seamen who worked close to the modernization of the port also helped to deliver people to the shore with a swimming boat before the plane drowned at 30 feet of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network data in the last two decades, 111 people died in air crashes related to PNG airlines, but the list does not include Air Niugini.
Analyst renewed the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the accusation party violated the case against a man accused of burning women from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Ministry of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified as an expert in the field of operational development for a few hours.
He told the jury how he used the cell phone records to reproduce the motion of 29-year-old Queenton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim of Jessica Chambers at the night of the murder.
Rowlett, according to the Clarion Ledger, told him that he received information about the location of several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his previous claim.
When the data showed that his cell phone was near Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the last one.
On Saturday, Sanford witnessed and claimed that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth, when she said that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lies because my pickup was in Nashville."
Another incompatibility was that Tellis claimed that Chambers knew about two weeks before her death.
The phone records indicated that they knew each other for only a week.
Rowlett told me that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed text messages, calls and contact information from Chambers’ phone.
"He removed it from his life," said Gail.
Protection should put out its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the process to pass to the jury later the same day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
Trio hip-hop executives want to challenge a negative view of the genre, filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed Group of Bristol claims that the hip-hop has changed its nature -- he has left political ideas and combat social problems.
They want to return to the sources and make a conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed the renewal of this directive in the United Kingdom through groups such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark skin?!
In New York, the nanny filed a couple for exemption, received a "racist" message.
In New York, the nanny filed a couple for a discriminatory release after she got the wrongly addressed message from her mother complaining that she was another darkness.
Marriage denies that they are racists, comparing the lawsuit to the demand.
Lyncy Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed anxiety when she saw a new nanny, Giselle Morris, who arrived at her first working day in 2016, a dark skin.
"No, one's dark," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in the report.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she twice sent him to Miss Morris.
According to the New York Post, aware of her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flaxman felt "whispered" and released Miss Morris, saying that their previous nanny, who was a African American, had been doing a bad job, and she was expecting a babysitter from the Philippines.
Miss Maurice paid for one day of work, and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is taking a couple to a court, hoping to get a reimbursement for the salary, which she would have received in six months of living in a marriage for which she was first hired, although without a contract, had $350 a day.
"I want to show them that I don't need to do this," she said the Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
In response to the accusation that they were racists, the couple stated that exemption of Morris was a reasonable decision because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after they were insulted.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said her husband, Joel Plasco.
"But would you leave your children with a man who was acting rude, even if it wasn't intentionally?
Your baby?
INFORMATION."
In comparison with the lawsuit, Plasco said that his wife had born a child just two months ago and "no more responded."
"Would you be revenge after that?
It's a bad act," added the investment banker.
Although the judicial proceedings continue, the Court of Justice quickly condemned this couple in social networks, criticizing their behavior and logic.
According to the new letter, the publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not understand the idea of a bear who was able to speak
The daughter of Bonda Karen Yankel, who was born almost immediately after the book was agreed to print, said about the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it's funny, because we know about the huge success that the Paddington story has gained."
Recalling that her father, who worked as an operator of the BBC, before a little toy bear inspired him to write a child's book, optimistically chosen to say that his work was denied, she divided as at the 60th anniversary of the exit of the book at the same time, she felt "rejoice and sadness," because the father died a year ago.
With regard to Paddington, who she described as a "very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was so proud that the book became so popular.
"He was quite a modest man and didn't like to brag," she said.
"But Paddington was as real to him as a child of his own, because when children reach something, we are proud of them, although it's not theirs and not our victory.
I think he was looking at the success of Paddington.
Although Paddington is the creation of his imagination, he has always attributed success to him."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was transported to a 2 hospital named Louis Paster in Nicka, where doctors were unsuccessfully trying to save her life.
"Nad regularly called, said that it was really bad that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Ednan-Lapperus.
"And then Над called me and said that she would die in the next two minutes and I must say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tassie, darling, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The medicines that the doctors gave her to keep her heart fighting gradually stopped and left her body.
She died a while before they turned it off.
I was just supposed to sit and wait, knowing what's going on at the time.
I couldn't push, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
She really had to keep herself in her hands."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperus, who was burning because of her daughter’s loss, sat on a plane along with other passengers, not taking into account the severe trials she had to survive.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head down and couldn't hold the tears.
It was difficult to explain, but I began deeply to compassionate Nada during the flight.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two women who have suffered grief leave cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones because of suicide work so as to prevent others from putting their hands on themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfris leave cards on the valley bridge with phone numbers for which people can look for support, as well as messages that would be praying to inspire them.
The son of Miss Davis Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and when he was 18 years old, he put his hands on himself.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same thing I feel every day," she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lydna, told her son was a prospective cook chief with an attractive smile.
"Everybody knew him for a smile.
They always said that this smile made any room lighter."
But he quit his job before he died because he wasn't in darkness.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11, found his brother’s body after he put his hands on himself.
Miss Davis says, "I'm constantly afraid that this will have consequences."
Miss Davis made cards, "that people know that there are people they can talk to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't get closed in yourself, you need to talk."
Ms. Hamfris, who had been friends with Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband Mark, who lived with her 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say that he felt depressed, that he had depression or something," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that it changed."
On Christmas day, he was finally deprived, and when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eye or anything."
She said that his death was a huge injury for them, but they must survive it, "It put a destructive one.
I'm gonna go to the family.
But we must continue to live and fight."
If you are trying to deal with the challenges, you can freely call good people by number 116 123 (United Kingdom and Ireland), send an email addressed to jo@samaritans.org or go to the Samaritans web site on this link.
The future of Bretta Cavano hangs on the hair: the FBI is starting the investigation
"I thought that if we could get what we asked -- limited in time and on the nature of investigation -- we might have reached a certain consent -- Mr. Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee was "depleted" on the basis of the endless loss of loyalty to the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Cavano and his Republicans want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is related to time.
The intermediate elections will only go in five weeks, on November 6th, and if the Republicans are expected to have problems, it will seriously make their attempts to make their own personal choices to the Supreme Court of State.
George W. Bush called the senators with a request to support Mr. Cavano, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush’s rule, and he met his wife Ashley, who was a personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI prepares his report?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently in session, there will be a vote.
It's still not clear whether Mr. Cavano can get at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pens to solve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidacy to the judge of the Supreme Court.
During Kim's government, the number of North Korean peripherals has "shook"
After Kim Chen In arrived seven years ago, the number of rebels from North Korea to South Korea decreased, stated the South Korean Legislative.
Pack Pyon Seug, referring to the data of the Ministry of the United States of South Korea, stated that last year, the number of perpetrators was 1127 compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Pack stated that key factors were to strengthen border control between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that traffickers carrying illegals now require more money.
In Phenyana, they abstained from public comments.
Most of the North Korean perpetrators finally offer South Korea's citizenship.
In Seul, more than 30,000 North Koreans were illegally crossing the border after the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most are running through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the well protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers the perpetrators as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forces them to repatriate.
Relationships between North and South Korea, which are still formally in war, have been clearly improved in the past months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenyana and discussed the question of denuclearization, which had been involved in negotiations.
This happened after the June historical meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Tramp and Kim Chen Ina, in Singapore, where they generally agreed to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yon-Ho, in the background of the sanctions adopted, has accused the United States of lack of progress since.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of our country's security, so there can be no one-sided disarmament in these circumstances," said Rie Yohn-Ho in his UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Cavano "histerical" and says he's not good for work in the Supreme Court.
The Leader of the Minority in the Palace of Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Cavano "histerical" and said he's not at the temperament to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I've been thinking that if a woman had ever spoken like this, she would be called "histerical," "Pelosi commented on her response to Cavano's testimony before the Senatu Legal Committee on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally denyed sexual violence against Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introduction, Cavano acted very emotional, and sometimes almost cried and coughed, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly condemned the democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him "absurding and coordinated destruction of the reputation," organized liberals who were angry that Gillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi believed that Cavano’s testimony had proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, since it showed his prejudice to the democrats.
"I think that these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and democrats, will take his own candidacy," she said.
Pelosi was upset when she was asked if she would try to announce Cavano impeachment, if his guilt was confirmed, and whether the democrats would get most in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say, if he doesn't tell the truth to the Congress or the FBI, it's not only worth working in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," Pelossi said.
Cavano is currently working in the U.S. Court of Appeal in Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Cavano against the law on accessible medical services or the case of Row v. Wade, because it is considered a conservative judge.
At his hearings on the issue of approval at Cavano’s position, he circled the question of whether he would cancel some decisions by the Supreme Court.
"Now it's not the time the judge becomes hysterical, the prejudiced person and we'll say how great it is," Pelosi said.
Women must possess this weapon.
These are just words that contain accumulated in months and years of anger, and she could not express them without tears.
"We're crying when we're angry," said Miss Steinne in 45 years.
"I don't think it's something unusual, do you?"
She continued, "A woman who worked somewhere as an executive director and helped me, said that she was crying when she was mad, but she had her own methods, and when she was mad and she started to cry, she said to the collaborator, "You can think that I was sad and that's why I'm crying.
And I'm angry."
And after that, she just continued.
I thought it was amazing."
The tears are considered to be a free way out of anger partly because they are viewed differently.
One of my most clear memories of the first job in the office, in which men mostly worked, was the situation when I once cried from an inexplicable anger, and the older woman, the undeserved manager I was always a little afraid of, grabbed me for the garment and dragged me to the staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy to get to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then congressman from the Democrats in Colorado, worked with Gary Garth at presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Garth was caught on an extra-bank boat called Monkey Business, then he left the race, deeply disappointed Miss Schroeder decided that there was no reason why she couldn't make a president's post.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she said with a laugh in 30 years.
"Seven other candidates have already participated in the race, and another candidate is the last thing they needed."
Someone called the situation "The Snowy and Seven Patuls."
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she was retaining the funds in the congregation, so she promised herself that she would not participate in the race unless she gathered two million dollars.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her favourites, who did not regret the support of the men of $1,000, had only $ 250.
"They think they're going to give me a slip?" she was surprised.
When she spoke with the talk and announced that she would not conduct an official campaign, it was covered by emotions — appreciation for those who supported her, disappointment by a system that complicated the collection of money and forced the voters not as to the members of the Chamber of Deputies, as well as the anger for sexism.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakthrough," said Miss Schroeder's press response.--
You'd think Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
Did I still think about what they would write on my grave plates?
"She cried?"
As a trade war between the United States and China can bring advantages to Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the trade war between the United States and China were desperate, and although far before it is completed, in a long - term perspective, the breakdown between countries can benefit Beijing.
The President of the United States, Donald Tramp, made the first warning shots in the beginning of this year, taxing basic Chinese export products, such as solar batteries, steel, and aluminium.
The biggest situation this week has increased because of new goods worth 200 billion dollars (50 billion pounds), which actually taxes half of all goods coming from China in the United States.
Beijing returned the same coin every time, recently putting a bribe between five and ten percent on American goods at $60 billion.
China had committed to taking similar measures, and the second largest economy in the world would hardly shortly miss the possibility of fulfilling this promise.
Forcing Washington to retreat means agreeing with the requirements, but for the President of China, the public worship of the United States is too shameful.
However, according to experts, if Beijing uses the situation properly, the pressure in the U.S. trade war can make China a long-term advantage, reducing the relationship between two economies.
"The quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a rapid economic fall in any of the countries, and this is actually a greater threat than the observers have recognized before," said an Abigail Grace, analyst who deals with Asia's issues in the Center for New American Security Center.
Foreign Minister stated that Syria was ready to return refugees.
In Syria, it is stated that they are ready for a voluntary return of refugees and are being asked for help in renewal of a land destructed by a war that lasted over seven years.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Valid Al-Mualem, stated that the conditions in the country have improved.
"Today, the real situation has become more stable and safer because of the progress achieved in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew the areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can return to normal life.
At the moment, all conditions for voluntary return of refugees to a country that they had to leave through terror, as well as unilateral economic measures that affected their daily life and limited the means of existence.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5,5 million Syrians fled from the country since the start of war in 2011.
Six million people who are still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem stated that the Syrian government would be pleased to receive assistance in renewal of a ruined war by the country.
But he emphasized that they would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries supporting the rebellion.
Europe has a victory on the Rider Cub in Paris
The team of Europe conquered the "Cubok Ryder" in 2018 when the U.S. team defeated a summary of 16.5:10.5 on Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated six times in Europe and has not won the 1993 Cubock Rider's tournament.
Europe returned the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn got 14,5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star, Phil Michelson, who made the best of the majority of the tournament, broke his first distant strike on the 16th hole of par-3 into the water, and Francesco Molinari went down.
The Italian golfist Molinari won in all his rounds and became one of the four players who had ever been through accounts 5 to 0 since the start of the contemporary tournament in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit defeated the account of 5:4 from a player with the lowest rating in the European team of Turbiern Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the first step in the world's rating, made up with the account of 2:1 Jan Poulter from England, who may have been part of the Reider Cook the last time.
The Spanish Sergeio Garcia, the veteran of Cubka Ryder, who has already participated in the tournament eight times, has become a European who wins most times in the tournaments all the time, bringing 25.5 points for his career.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't do anything today.
It was a difficult year.
Thank Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
It's a team, and I'm glad I could help," he said, without stopping the emotions, Garcia after winning in Europe.
He transmits the estaphet to his co-citizen John Rem, who won the American legend of Tiger Woods on Sunday in a lonely game with account 2:1.
"I feel incredibly proud of the victory of Tyger Woods, and I grew up watching this boy," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France, Woods has lost all four matches and now has a career record on the "Cubock Ryder" tournament 13-21-3.
A strange statistics for one of the most famous players of all times who won 14 Major tournaments, only Jack Niclaus.
The United States Assembly has tried to reach the Farway area during all weekends, except for Patrick Rid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed a high - class golf throughout the tournament.
The U.S. Captain Jim Furic said about his team after the uncomfortable performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they were fighting.
This morning we did not dominate over Europe for long.
We fought.
I'm taking the hat off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the Association of Professional Golf Players in the United States and the Tournament Committee, and we're going forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud of being their captain.
We can't not praise them.
We lost."
