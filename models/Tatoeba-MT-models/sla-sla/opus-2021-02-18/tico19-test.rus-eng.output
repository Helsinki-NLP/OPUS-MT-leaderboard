How long are these symptoms present?
and all the pains in the breast cell should be treated in this way, especially in view of your age
and with high temperature
and also required to verify your cholesterol and arterial pressure levels
And do you have a high temperature now?
And do you now experience this pain in your breast cell?
Besides, it is hard for you to breathe.
And can you tell me what other symptoms you have other than these?
and how high your temperature was
And I still have cough.
And I've got a little cough cough.
And I'm really having a pain in my breast cell today.
And whether this is the time of showing the shadow fever to which you are subjected
and pain in the breast cell
And I think I'm getting a little up.
And I want you to describe where your breast cell is hurting.
and they also have a little higher temperature
and with your diabetes history
And you know, it feels like my chest's gonna be smashed.
And you know, people cough on me all the time.
And you have pain in the breast cell

Someone in the family has heart problems, heart failure, heart attack, high cholesterol level, high arterial pressure
Any other symptoms or problems you have seen and related to muscle pain?
Do you have any other patients with the same symptoms?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Are you breathing now?
Do you still feel pain in the breast cell
because it's a flu season
But we should also not be ignored because of the pain in the breast cell with cardiological nature
However, the more important problem now is this pain in the breast cell
But I'm having a difficult breath.
But I know a lot of people cough on me.
But we must approach any pain in the breast cell with maximum seriousness.
But you're breathing right now, right?
Because I don't remember this pain in the chest.
Does it seem like someone's squeezing your chest?
You still feel breathing.
Are they complaining of the symptoms of bad self-consciousness?
Do you have any other chronic diseases such as high arterial pressure or something like that?
Do you have any other chronic diseases or medical problems such as diabetes?
Do you feel breathing in this pain in your breast cell?
Do you have a high arterial pressure?
Do you have a breath on this?
Do you know what symptoms she had?
Do you see this picture?
Sing a lot of liquid today
But I'm doing diabetes tests.
But she had symptoms exactly as I did.
How high is your temperature?
What's your arterial pressure?
if you still have a high temperature
if you have the temperature of 38 and nine or above
if you think your symptoms or problems guarantee improvement in the appearance
Yesterday, I had a fever.
I also had a little temperature yesterday.
I had a temperature yesterday.
I have a sharp pain in my breast cell here.
I also have a little difficult breath.
I'll send you a picture.
I'm in some breast pain today.
I've got a little headache today, and the temperature's up.
I think it's a flu.
I think it's a flu in a light form.
Does this remind you that a very, very heavy man is sitting on your neck?
All of this began almost at the same time with the headache and temperature increase
I'm in the heart of my chest.
This pressures like the pain in the breast cell
It's in my chest.
It's in the center of my breast cell.
It's in the center of the breast cell
I got a chest pain.
I'm really worried about this pain in my chest.
I want you to describe this pain in my chest.
as high arterial pressure or diabetes
as exactly in the centre of the breast cell
From high temperature, you can now take tahipirin in the form of ice cream
And now, Mary, tell me, for how many days you've had these symptoms.
Now you said you felt a pain in your chest.
Sometimes I feel a little pain in my chest.
Do you have any other symptoms than pain?
Or is someone sitting on your chest?
Precisely the same high temperature and cough, head and muscle pain
pain directly in the center of my breast
Show me on this picture where you feel pain
because you have a high temperature.
So do you think some of these symptoms could be related to pregnancy?
So, do your children have some of the same symptoms?
Tell me about your chest pain.
Temperature increases at night
The temperature I had in the last two days
Temperature began to rise last night
This is Dr. Porter at the recruitment of the aid point.
Okay, can you tell me a little more about your chest pain?
Well, I feel pain in the front of my body, here, in my chest.
Well, I feel a pain in my chest.
So when I feel pain in my chest
What kind of pain do you feel in your chest?
When did you start feeling that pain in your chest?
Where exactly do you feel your chest pain?
where exactly you feel that pain in your chest
You feel like a feeling of shame in your chest.
You know, I have diabetes and all that.
You said that you're suffering this pain in the breast cell.
Rapidly growing rate of cumulative coronavir infections (CIVID-19) in the European Union and Britain between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
Coronavir infections (CIVID-19) have similar trends in the countries of the European Economic Zone and Great Britain, thus reaffirming that, despite different stages of its development in different countries, COVID-19 pandemia is rapidly increasing in all countries.
In view of the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensifying therapy, it is necessary to increase the readiness of patients with COVID-19 to treat and, in particular, intense therapy.
On 31 December 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown ethology were reported in the Uhan Province Hubay.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centre for Control and Prevention of Disabilities reported that the infection is a new type of coronavir, now known as a severe severe respiratory syndrome of 2th type (SARS-COV-2).
Since now, the disease caused by SARS-COV-2 has become called coronavir infection (CIVID-19).
According to today's available data, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 are in a light form, i.e. in the form of respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, while most of the patients are healed.
Approximately 14 per cent of COVID-19 is developed in a more difficult form with the need for hospitalization, while the remaining 6 per cent takes critical form when intense therapy is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
This study analyses the trends of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union (EU) / the European Economic Zone (ECE) and the Great Britain and compares them to the trends in the Chinese province of Hubai.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/ECE and Britain with data to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEZ and Britain
Following the explosion in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic is currently developing in the rest of the world according to the same dynamic as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the pandemic of COVID-19.
In the Eurosurveillance magazine dated 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiterri and his colleagues reported the first confirmed COVID-19 disease in Europe, which met the criteria under which WHO defines the existence of diseases.
Three first confirmed cases in the EU/ECE were registered in France on 24 January 2020; all three patients returned from Mr. Uhan of the Chinese Province of Hubai.
As at 15 March 2020, COVID-19 infections have been identified in all 30 countries of EU/ECE and Great Britain, with 39,768 infections and 1,727 deaths, including 1,441 with a death outcome, for the period from 31 December 2019 to that date.
Definition of cumulative quantity and cumulative COVID-19
The European Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases (ECDC) updates the number of registered cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world from official sources such as the Ministries of Health of these countries, national and regional health management bodies and WHO.
These data are used to analyse COVID-19 trends in the EU/ECE and Britain and to compare them to Italy ' s data.
The COVID-19 rate of the proliferation of active cases was calculated for 14 days by COVID-19, taking into account the normal COVID-19 flow in each EU/EEA and Britain for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the total number of cases recorded in each country at 8:00 15 March 2020, compared to Italy ' s data from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 development trends in EU/ECE countries and United Kingdom
The trends of COVID-19 in the 14-day period in the EU/EEA and Britain in general were in line with the trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubai (art. 1).
Comulative COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and Britain, as a whole, increased on approximately 21 February, and on 28 February 2020, a sharp jump of this indicator (supplementary material).
This was mainly caused by a rapid increase in the number of registered diseases in Italy, but in all other countries, the EU/EEA and Britain, similar trends to the rise of COVID-19 (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and Britain compared to the similar indicator for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to this, the total number of cases already registered as at 8:00 on 15 March in 15 other EU/ECE and Britain countries compared to the amount set out in Italy for about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results indicate the rapid growth of the COVID-19 registered cases in the EU/EEA and Britain.
Observed trends of COVID-19 show that the pandemic is developing comparable speed in all countries.
Despite different stages in different countries, the distinctions in responses taken by national public health authorities and perhaps different criteria for recognition of disease cases and different patient selection rules for the analysis of the presence of COVID-19, including the “convertible” testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, the doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10 per cent of patients with COVID-19 required intensive therapy, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive therapy offices in these regions have already been maximised.
At present, data on the income of patients with COVID-19 to hospitals and (or) intensive therapy offices in the EU/ECE are only available for 6% and 1% of cases accordingly (not submitted).
However, a systematic collection of such information is necessary to complement current observations, which include the number of registered cases and the number of deaths.
According to the 2010-2011 study, there is a significant dissemination of cock in intensive therapy and intensive care offices in Europe: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 leagues in intensive therapy and intensive care offices for 100,000 people in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC report on the risk assessment of COVID-19 presents the modelling of the loading of health systems with estimated data on the infected COVID-19 in each country of EU/EES and Britain, where the risk of lack of cokes available in intensive therapy offices exceeds 90%.
Since cases are currently grouped in certain regions of the EU/ECE and Britain and hospitals and intensifying therapy are generally served by the population of a certain territorial group, information on infection and number of cocks in intensive therapy offices is recommended to provide at the 2nd level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for the purposes of statistics (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU/EEA and Britain.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and offices of intensive therapy should be prepared for a contact infection scenario of SARS-CoV-2, which has not been weakened for a long time, and for the rise of patients with COVID-19 needing medical assistance, and in particular for intense therapy, for example in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the latest report of the ECDC on the results of the risk expression assessment, it is essential to prevent SARS-COV-2 from disseminating the operational, precautionary and integrated approach with a subsequent transition from restraint to minimization of consequences, since, given the predictable rapid increase in the number of diseases, the decisionmakers and hospitals may simply not have sufficient time to consider, take and correct their responses if such measures are not taken in advance.
The report on risk assessment results also lists public health measures to mitigate the pandemic impact.
They only have a short period of time during which they can intensify their control efforts to slow down the SARS-COV-2 distribution and reduce the load on their health systems.
If not, in the coming days or weeks of the health system in other EU/ECE countries, the inflammation of patients will require intensive therapy.
The explosion of the coronavir infection 2019 (CIVID-19), caused by a severe coronavir severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) of 2nd type (SARS-COV-2), has become a tragedy for mankind: at present in China and other countries, more than 3,000 people have been infected.
Like a homological virus of SARS-CoV, caused by a severe severe respiratory syndrome in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from flying mouses and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and less mortality than SARS, but it is much more infected and affected by older people more often than young men and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, an appropriate and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing study.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, ethology, virusology, diagnostic, treatment, prognosis for further fluid and prevention of this disease.
Although the answers to many questions are yet to be found, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate the dangerous disease.
The spring celebration (Chinese New Year), which fell on 25 January 2020, became an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese people who were urged to stay at home for the whole holiday and for many weeks after it.
Given the high degree of similarity to the coronavirus (CV), the explosion of a severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 called the SARS-COV-2 virus, and the associated disease was a coronary infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Uhan and quickly spread across the country, and then nearly 50 other countries of the world.
More than 80,000 COVID-19 confirmed cases have been identified on 2 March 2020, more than 40,000 patients were recovered, more than 3,000 were over.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “the enemy number one for society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than two months later, more than 200 publications on COVID-19, including articles on its virusology, epidemiology, ethology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which defines the sequence of the virus allocated to a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarize the results of the studies in a new and rapidly developing subject area.
As far as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronavirus caused by a coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), whose explosion occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts known at the moment on prevention and prediction of the flow of disease, as well as some other not less substantial issues.
Coronavirs were traditionally treated with patogens that were not deadly dangerous for humans and mainly caused about 15% of the general respiratory diseases 4.
Nevertheless, in this century, we had twice encountered high-patogen human coronavirus, i.e. a severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2) and the coronavir of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV), which caused an explosion of diseases in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively and soon broadcasted to many other States with a terrible level of severity of disease and mortality.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third flash of coronavir in human history.
As indicated in Figure 1.1, the report on the classters of the plasma cases of unknown origin first entered the National Health Commission of the CNB of Mr. Uhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, a genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first death case in Mr. Uhan was registered.
Meanwhile, the epidemic was rapidly spread into neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, medical infections were known to be infected, which provided for the possibility of transmitting the virus from human to human.
On 23 January, quarantine was introduced to Mr. Uhan, stopped the city's public transport.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study of this disease, 21 of 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contacts with the sea-product market in Mr. Uhan, which was considered a point of dissemination of an unknown animal infection.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the explosion of the coronavir was a global emergency in public health.
During the preparation of the report, the disease has been spread throughout China and has already been invaded in approximately 50 other countries worldwide (ris.2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and the risk of the explosion is still to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, following a multicentral clinical study with 8 866 patients, including 4 021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, the next updated image of the epidemic development (https://mp.weixin.q.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bdA).
SARS-COV-2 has been infected by all age groups, but mostly people aged from 30 to 65 years of age.
Almost half (47.7%) infected were over 50 years old, few were 20, and only 14 infected had not yet been 10 years old.
Infection of SARS-COV-2 among men above (0.31/100 000) than among women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was distributed by clusters mainly in the province of Hubai and in nearby regions.
The diagnosis has been 5 (2 to 9 days in the mean since the COVID-19 symptoms were presented.
The incubation period was on average 4,8 (3,0–7,2) of the day.
From the time of symptoms before death, the average was 9.5 (4.8 to 13) of the day.
The base of reproduction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
By 23 January 2020, an exponential increase in the number of infected persons compared with large transport transports after the celebration of the New Year of China.
The death rate of patients with a confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10 to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate of 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02 to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors in the case of COVID-19 were: gender (man), age (≥60) and severe cases of pneumonia.
Coronavirs are the subsemination of major shell viruses containing one meaningful RNA.
They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and betacorononavirs are known to be impressed by people.
In the case of coronavirus of type SARS and MERS, the glycoprotein of the shells (S) shall be linked to the cell receptors of angiotensin converting ferment of type 2 (ACE2) and the dipeptidilpeptidasis-4 (DPP4) accordingly, after which the membrane synthesis occurs.
The cytoplazm releases viral RNA genome; after replication of a virus genome, the RNA genome, along with the shell glucoproteins and nucleocopsidal proteins, generates virio-containing sequences, which subsequently complied with the membrane cell by releaseing the virus.
The first reports on the SARS-COV-2 genome sequence appeared on 10 January 2020.
It is established that SARS-COV-2 is a new type of betacorononavir, whose genome 99.98 per cent compared to 10 consecutive samples collected in the first flash of the illness in the sea-products of Juanan in Mr.
Genetically, SARS-COV-2 is closer to SARS-COV than to MERS-COV.
With the educational electronic microscopy of the SARS-COV-2 particle, the ultratonic cuts of human breathing epithel were found.
It is established that the human enzyme ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, S-protein SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the ACE2 enzyme of a person weaker than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-COV-2 causes patients to have less severe disease than SARS-COV.
SARS-COV-2 can also generate an unknown short-living protein, coded orf3b, and a secret protein coded orf8.
The orf3b orf3b of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can play a part of the patogenity of the virus and suppress the IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, the authors' collection, headed by Jou (Zhou), presented reports on the cryoelectronic томography of the structure of the full-dimensional ACE2 enzyme with 2.9 Å in the B0AT1 transporter.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed communications, was gathered as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could link two S-proteins, which serves as evidence in identifying and infecting the coronavir.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for a medicinal box to suppress the SARS-COV-2 infection.
The origin and intermediate master
It is known that both SARS-COV and MERS-COV were flagging mouses, from which the virus was transmitted to the person through the cybet and camels accordingly.
By filogenetic comparison SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirs, it was established that the first owners of SARS-CoV-2 are flagging mouses, since the new 96% virus is the same as two coronavirs of SARS, namely, the coronavirus of SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown what kind of transmission has become a intermediate host, which has made the virus to overcome the type of barrier and infect humans; the transmission path is also to be found.
Mr. Ji (Ji) and his colleagues assumed that the transmitters of the virus from flying mouse to man became snakes, which took place in the S-protein homological recombination.
According to their studies, Chinese scientists in Guanchjou assumed that the pangolines are a long-term peasant feeding and frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potential intermediate owners of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 per cent genetic comparison between the coronavir of pangolin and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference between both genomes is very large, and the final results with specific evidence are not yet considered (art. 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-COV-2 are not known mostly.
In laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive within 48 hours in the dry environment and up to 5 days at below 20 °C and 40 to 50% moisture.
SARS-COV-2 may have similar properties.
The SARS-COV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultrafial and heating up to 56 °C within 30 minutes; the effective blocking of the virus activity may ether, 75 per cent of the ethyl alcohol, containing disinfective substances, perux acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorguexidine.
Human population generally has no immunity to SARS-COV-2, so people are perceptive to a new virus.
There are currently no data on detailed studies of immune response to SARS-COV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronavirus, primarily SARS-COV and MERS-CoV (art. 4).
In general, the host's body of virus first recognizes the birth immune system through image recognition receptors (ORR), including C-type lecture receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus causes expression of factors of inflammation, dendrite cells and synthesis of type I interferons that prevent the spread of the virus and accelerate the fagocytosis of macrophags against virus antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-COV can avoid immune response.
Soon, a adaptive immune reaction is included in combating the virus.
T-limfocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+, play an important role in the protection of the body.
T cells CD4+ stimulate the generation of viral antibodies in B cells, and T cells CD8+ directly kill the cells affected by the virus.
T-helpers produce anti-fuel cytokines that help protective cells.
However, the coronavir can inhibit the functions of T cells by causing their programmed destruction.
The humoral immunity, including C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in combating virus infection.
For example, the antibodies separated from the healed patient have neutralized MERS-COV.
On the other hand, the hyperreaction of the immune system has brought local education of large numbers of free radicals, which may cause serious damage to lungs and other organs, and in the worst scenario, leads to polyorganised deficiencies and even death.
The SARS-COV-2 infection, which is characterized by classter manifestation, is more likely to affect older people with patologies and pregnant women.
Probability of infection is higher for people who are affected by a large number of viruses or have immune system violations.
According to data studies on the first 425 infections in Mr. Uhan, the calculated average incubation period of SARS-COV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mainly 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,0999 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days, while the distribution was between 0 and 24 days.
The study described above, based on demographic 8 866 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3,0–7,2) of the day.
For health authorities, it is important to adjust the quarantine time limits for the most precise calculation of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus by the infected persons whose disease is without symptoms.
A 14-day quarantine was generally practiced for persons who had contacts with the virus or virus infected.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often a high temperature, which can be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry coughing, breathing difficult, muscle pain, headache, headache, throat pain, wetness, breast pain, diarrhoea, muscle and wreck.
Some patients have been detected in breathing and (or) hypoxie within a week after the start of the disease.
In difficult cases, the disease has progressed quickly, and patients have developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with high temperature and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be checked on the virus for early diagnosis even if there are no patologies on the chest photos.
The demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 revealed the following symptom dissemination rates: 98% high temperature, 76% dry cough, 55% breathing and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients required lung ventilation.
Similar results have been obtained from two recent studies of family infections and transmission of virus from unsymptomic infected.
Compared results were received in 2012 in the MERS-COV study, with major symptoms also high temperature (98%), dry cough (47%) and breath (55%).
However, 80 per cent of the lung ventilation was required, which was much higher than in patients with COVID-19, and it corresponded to a higher decline of mortality from MERS than COVID-19.
The diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high temperature (99 to 100%), dry cough (29 to 75%), breathing (40 to 42%), diarrhoea (2-225%) and throat pain (13 to 25%), while the artificial ventilation of lights requires 14 to 20% of patients.
At 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2 per cent and the total number of alleged cases in the world reached 66,576.
In comparison with that indicator, the death rate from SARS to November 2002 was 10 per cent of 8 096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, the demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed the mortality of 37 per cent of 2 494 confirmed cases.
As a result of an early study, the basic reproduction indicator (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47 per 95 per cent confidential interval (CI) within 5.71 to 7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only from 2 to 4.
SARS-COV-2 comparison with MERS-COV and SARA-COV on symptoms, mortality levels and R0 are listed in Table 1.1.
The above indicators indicate the higher capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to be distributed compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the rate of mortality in the case of infection of a new virus below compared to the last two.
Thus, the sustainability of the SARS-COV-2 epidemic will be much more difficult than the epidemic of MERS-COV and SARS-COV.
The cluster manifestation is often infected within one family or group of people gathered together for any reason or in any transport, such as on a cruise ship.
Patients have often traveled to Mr. Uhan or to other affected regions, lived there or contacted infected or infected in the past two weeks before the start of the disease.
However, according to the reports, people may be treated with virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and the healed patients, who are resigned from the hospital, may become the virus bearers again, which is an alarming signal for the extension of the quarantine period.
At the early stage, patients have normal or lower number of leucocytes ( especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 have been established with lymphopes with 4x109/L leucocytes, including 1x109/L levels, as well as increased levels of aminotransferase and viruse.
In some patients, increased levels of liver, muscle enzymes and mioglobin were found in the blood, and most patients experienced increased levels of the P-reactive protein and blood erythrocytes.
Patients with severe diarrhoea, the D-dimer level, the fibrine dissolving product present in the blood has increased, and the lymphocytes have constantly decreased.
Most patients with COVID-19 in the rentgenography of the breast cell have been found in patologies characterized by inequality eclipse from both sides or eclipse of the type of " mate glass " in the lungs.
Patients are often developing atipical pneumonia, acute injury of lungs and acute respiratory disease (OPC).
In the development of ORS, uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to substantial gas exchange violations.
The dysfunction of types I and II of pneumocy reduces the level of surface-activated connections and increases surface pressure, thus reducing the ability of lights to expand and increase the risk of lung decline.
Thus, the worst results of the rentgenography are often coincided with the most difficult cases of disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the exhaustion of pneumocytes, the formation of hyaline membranes and intertail lymphocytary infiltration, and multinuclear syncithial cells in light patients dying from disease corresponding to the pathology of virus infection and ORS and similar to those found in SARS and MERS.
The main criterion in diagnosticing COVID-19 was used by the method of detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA through a polymerate chain reaction with reverse transcryption (PRC with reverse transcryption).
However, taking into account the high level of false negative results that may accelerate the rate of epidemic development, since 13 February 2020, China began diagnosis based on clinical manifestations (with no more reliance only on the PRC with reverse transcryption).
The situation with SARS diagnosis was similar.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is crucial and necessary to combine the history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and results of rentgenography.
On 14 February 2020, the team of experts under the leadership of Mr. Fen Jean (Feng Zhang) described the protocol for the application of the SHERLOCK method based on the CRISPR reproduction to detect SARS-CoV-2; this method allows the synthetic fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA with the density of 20 × 10-18 mol/l to 200 × 10-18 mol/l (1-100 copies per microliter of the source sample) using indication bars less than an hour without the use of complex equipment.
This new methodology, if it is successful in the clinical medicinal products, may significantly increase the sensitivity of the tests and convenience.
In the absence of experience in anticipating previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can mainly provide with COVID-19 only supportive therapy, while trying to use any therapeutic methods that have been used or proposed for treatment of other coronavirs, such as SARS-COV and MERS-CoV, as well as other virus diseases (table (table 2).2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunity suppressors, steroids, plasmas of patients who are treated, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of healed patients was proposed for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are rushing to develop antibodies and vaccines to combat the virus.
At the initial stages, SARS-COV-2 attacks mainly light and may be less affected by other organs expressing ACE2, such as stomach tract and kidneys.
Nevertheless, the violation of work and refusal of respiratory organs are the main threat and cause of the death of patients.
Thus, to facilitate symptoms and rescue of life is critical support for the respiratory function, including the overall oxygen therapy, the delivery of high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation and the invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, which are designated depending on the weight of illness.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporal membrane oxigenation (ECMO), a modified extrapulmonary blood suspension method used to treat the risk to life of heart or respiratory insufficiency.
Furthermore, the importance of SARS-COV-2 is maintaining a water-soli balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as the protection of the functions of vital organs.
The cytoquine storm is known as a result of the hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected by SARS and MERS.
The cytoquine storm is the form of a systemic inflammatory process developing in response to the series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFN and ICP-1.
These cytokines provoke immunities to an enormous quantity of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of ERS and polyorganised deficiencies.
In treatment of cytoquine storm, especially in severe state, immunity is essential.
The cytoquine storm used corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monochlonic antibodies serving as interleukine 6.
Other cytoquine storm treatment methods based on immune suppression include the modulation of immune reactions aimed at T cell control; IFN-α, IL-1 and TNF cytokin blockade; janus kinaza pressure; application of blinatumomab, cytokine signal suppressors 4 and inhibitors of histondeacetalasis.
In order to reduce the severity of the implications of the inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS, steroids are widely used as immunity suppressors.
However, steroids in high doses do not benefit from the treatment of severe light damages in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they may cause serious side effects, especially avacular osteonecross, which significantly deteriorates the forecast.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended to be cautious in treating patients with COVID-19 in critical state.
At the time of the document, there is no confirmed effective antiviral therapy.
However, the intervention of the remdecivier, a nucleotic analogue, has been an effective treatment of an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a recently developed antivirus medicine, initially developed by the Gilead company to treat the diseases caused by Ebola and the Marbour virus.
Later, the remdecivir also demonstrated the possibility of the suppression of other viruses with the one-carbon RNA, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these data, Gilead provided China with this medicinal product to conduct parent studies in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies were eagerly expected.
In addition, barricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ritonavir were proposed as possible options for therapy of patients with sharp respiratory symptoms.
Combined treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhea, nausea, mutilation, liver defeat and other side effects.
It should be careful to monitor the interaction of these medicinal products with other medicines assigned to patients.
Plasma of healed patients and antibodies
Blood gathering has been used for other patients who have been treated with the same disease or for the protection of the healthy population for a long time.
In fact, the blood of healed patients often contains relatively high amounts of antibodies to combat patogen.
The antithels are in the immunoglobulin produced by B-limfocytes to combat patogens and other extranational objects; they recognize individual patogen molecules and neutralize them directly.
Based on this provision, a plasma of blood samples of patients treated with COVID-19, which was subsequently introduced to 10 severely ill patients.
During 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the acuteness of inflammation and viral load, as well as oxygen saturation.
However, in order to offer a massive use of this method before specific therapy, the verification and explanations are not yet carried out.
In addition, considering the therapeutic effect, some of the plasma-related deficiencies should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies may excessively stimulate the immune system and cause the cytokine emission syndrome, which, taking into account toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
The concentration of blood antibodies is usually low, and the plasma for therapy of patients is critical.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to overcome the global epidemic.
Thus, more important and more practically, to allocate B cells to healed patients and to determine the genetic code of effective antibodies or to carry out a recording to find effective antibodies against critically important proteins of the virus.
So we can go straight to mass anti-thel production.
For thousands of years, Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its efficiency is significantly dependent on the combination of multiple components of the formula, which is different according to the diagnosis based on Chinese traditional medicine theory.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have uncertain action, as the allocation and verification of these components or their optimum combination seems difficult.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific therapy with COVID-19, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative methods for treatment of patients with light and medium weight of symptoms or for patients who are healed after a severe stage of disease.
For example, the capsules of Shu Feng Jie Du and the capsules of Lyan Hua Qing Wen (Lian Hua Qing Wen) were considered to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The largest share of healed patients with COVID-19 was observed in a number of provinces of China, in which Chinese traditional medicine was used in the treatment of 87 per cent of patients, including in Ghansa (63.7 per cent), Ninsa (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), where Chinese traditional medicine was only used for treatment of approximately 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19, was found in the lowest share of healed persons (13 per cent).
However, this is quite a rough comparison, as the assessment should be carried out in view of the number of other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the extent of the severity of their disease.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Jean (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published research materials, which compared treatment exclusively with Western medicine and combined treatment methods of Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the periods for the normalization of body temperature, the elimination of symptoms and medical assistance in the condition of the station have been less than in patients whose treatment was used in the combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine methods, than in patients treated only by Western methods.
The most remarkable is the fact that the percentage of patients who have had had a deterioration of symptomism (from easy to severe) was noted below in the group treated by combining Western and Chinese traditional medicine methods than in a group treated only by Western methods (7.4 per cent compared to 46.2 per cent), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8 per cent compared to 39 per cent).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more carefully controlled studies conducted in a larger and larger quantity of regions.
Specific interest is also to obtain, as possible, the mechanism of action and the explanation of the effectiveness of components used in Chinese traditional medicine methods or combinations.
Patients suspected or confirmed the existence of COVID-19 are mainly experiencing strong fear of acute and even death disease, and people closed to quarantine also experience boredness, loneliness and extreme irritation.
Furthermore, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxie and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as corticosteroid sleep, may cause further anxiety and psychological stress.
Early stages of the disease caused by the SARS reported a number of psychiatric diseases, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, deliria, and even suicidal behavior.
The mandatory monitoring of contacts and quarantine measures taken by the health authorities to prevent the COVID-19 epidemic may increase the anxiety and guilt of the spread of infection, quarantine and social stick on their families and friends.
Therefore, psychological and psychiatric assistance should be provided to patients with COVID-19, persons suspected and contacted with them, as well as to all the other people it required.
In the context of psychological support, multi-profile psychiatric assistance brigade should be formed, clearly informed with regular and accurate updates of the SARS-COV-2 epidemic and the treatment plans and use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contacts.
Effective vaccines play an important role in interrupting the transmission chain from animals and infected people to perceptive hosts and are often used in addition to the antiviral therapy used to sustain epidemic caused by new viruses.
A vaccine-based S-protein work has been undertaken to develop long-term and high-active neutralizing antibodies and (or) protection immunity to SARS-CoV.
Animal studies developed live weakened vaccines from SARS viruses.
However, prior to the start of clinical studies, the effectiveness of these possible vaccines in natural conditions should be determined in patients of age, infection model and protection against zoo virus infections.
It may be the reason that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and since then no new case has been reported.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of disease caused by MERS in the Middle East and spreading into other regions through the preservation of zoo sources in endemic accommodation.
In order to combat MERS, vaccination strategies were developed with inactivated virus, DNA plasmide, viral vectors, particles, viral particles and recombinant protein elements, and some of these strategies have been assessed on animals.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-COV-2 for non-immune persons is an urgent and critical challenge that requires a solution to the sustaining epidemic.
There are, however, serious difficulties caused by a long term (average 18 months) required to develop a vaccine and a dynamic vision of coronavirs.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 only begins to show a complete picture of the clinical fluctuation of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to gradually recover without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with the high frequency of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
Therefore, it is crucial for health authorities to draw up a prognostic model of disease in order to identify the priorities of the measures taken, especially in areas where the lack of resources is observed.
Based on the current clinical studies, the following factors may affect the prediction of or related disease in patients with COVID-19 (table 33):
Age: The age was the most important factor in predicting the proliferation of the disease caused by the SARS, which also corresponds to the truth in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 is mainly impressed by patients aged 30 to 65, 47.7 per cent of whom are older than 50, according to the above-mentioned study of 8 866 cases.
Patients who needed intensive therapy were more likely to have original diseases and complications, and they were much older than those who had not required such treatment (average 66 to 51 years), which indicates that age is a prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: Infection of SARS-COV-2 among men above women (0.31/100 000 v. 0.27/100 000), as mentioned above.
Disease and complications: patients with COVID-19 who need intensive therapy are more likely to develop severe miocard and arrhythmia.
Cardiological phenomenons were also the main cause of the death of patients with SARS.
SARS-COV-2 was reported to also be in contact with ACE2 positive holangiocites, which could cause hepatic impairment in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and original diseases are closely linked and can distort results.
The deviations identified in laboratory studies: the level of the B-reactive protein in the blood reflects the gravity of the inflammatory process or injury of tissues, and it is proposed to be considered as a potential prognostic factor of disease flow, response to therapy and final recovery.
It was also proposed to take into account the relationship between the level of the P-reactive protein, the severity of disease and the projection of COVID-19.
Furthermore, the results may also be foreseen by an increase in lactatdehydrogenase, aparagin aminotransferases, alanin-aminotransferases and creatinkinasis.
These enzymes, in large quantities, are allocated by different organs, especially with heart and cake, and their emissions occur when tissues are damaged.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Basic clinical symptoms: for the projection of results and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, other factors should be taken into account the rentgenographic studies of the breast cell and the development of clinical symptoms over time.
The use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunity suppressors widely used in infectious diseases as an additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Since SARS patients with severe forms were widely used by corticosteroids, many survivors have developed avascular osteonecross, causing life disabilities and low quality of life.
Thus, if it is necessary for the use of steroids to treat patients with COVID-19, these medicinal products should be appointed in small doses and in short courses.
Psychological stress: as described above, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress, because they often have to endure long quarantine periods, cope with high indetermination and observe the death of their relatives and other patients.
In order to remove stress from such patients and help them to return to normal life, psychological consultations must be conducted and long-term support.
According to the demographic studies, the COVID-19 epidemic is apparently different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replicating in lower respiratory paths, SARS-CoV-2 viruses, as well as other coronavirs that cause normal cold diseases, can successfully reproduce in upper respiratory paths and cause weak symptoms or do not cause symptoms at the early stage of infection.
For this reason, those patients who have early or have not ended the incubation period may, in their ordinary life, distribute the virus significantly, which is significantly difficult for the epidemiological control.
However, the transmission of the SARS-CoV virus was considered to occur when patients were severely ill, while most cases were not infected at the early stage.
Thus, today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic and is more difficult to control.
There is now a great work in China, in which universal quarantine was declared in Mr. Uhan and neighbouring cities, as well as a prolonged quarantine regime for almost all the population introduced to interrupt the SARS-COV-2 spread chain.
Although these measures have severely harmed the economy and other areas of life, the number of new patients detected is reduced, which indicates that the rate of epidemic dissemination is slow.
In the most optimistic calculations, the explosion of the disease will end by March, and the faze of silence will take 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter and his colleagues considered that the COVID-19 flash, which seemed much more infectious than the SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from the group headed by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) set up a model to project the end of the epidemic and assumed that the SARS-COV-2 virus could affect two thirds of the world's population.
The Canadian Professional Group reported that the SARS-COV-2 virus was discovered in nose and throat weapons taken from patients who were healed and expelled from hospitals two weeks earlier, which indicates that a new virus could become a cyclic disease similar to the flu.
However, the reduction in the number of new cases in China encouraging that the strategies currently applied may have resulted.
According to initial forecasts, the Ebola fever had to affect up to a million people and be caused by half a million patients.
However, strict quarantine and isolation of diseases have eventually been under control.
It is likely that, like the SARS-COV virus, the infectious capability of SARS-COV-2 can weaken, and with time it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that is cooperating with a person.
The comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemic (Figure 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by high speed of transmission through cough or sneaking, as well as perhaps through direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus was also discovered in the circle, which means that orally-effective means of transmission were also possible.
According to one of the recent studies, 41% of 138 studies may have been infected in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously detected diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Thus, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, relatives, colleagues, and even foreign contacts with patients or infected.
The first line of defence in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is the nose of masks for the person; both surgery masks and N95 respirators (series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgery masks do not allow microcaps to liquid from potentially infected air flowers and sit on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to the environment.
However, only the masks of the N95 class (series No. 1860s) can protect from respiration of virions from 10 to 80 nm, they only miss 5% of virions; the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as SARS-COV, and they are both of approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can even invade through five joint surgical masks, medical workers who directly contact patients must wear N95 class masks (series No. 1860s), not surgery masks.
In addition to the masks, medical workers should wear a protective coat on the figure in order to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruss can also fall into the body through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, the physician infected SARS-CoV-2 despite the fact that he was wearing a mask of class N95; perhaps the virus had been inflammated through his eyes.
Therefore, medical workers should also wear transparency face shields or protective glasses of a closed type.
All populations in the affected or potentially threatened regions are urged to wash their hands more commonly by disinfecting washing, not to leave the house with self-izolation and to limit contacts with potentially infected people.
The patient is estimated a distance of about a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-COV-2 virus had not been known to mankind before, the high degree of its similarity to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, had to become an alarming signal for China, taking into account the experience it gained during the SARS explosion in 2003.
However, only after 19 January 2020, the Director of the Centre for Disease Control in Mr. Uhan, reassured citizens, reporting that the new virus has low contamination and limited reproductiveness in transmission from human to humanity and that preventing the spread and control of disease would not be a problem.
This statement has significantly reduced social tension, especially during the time when the whole country was preparing to celebrate the Chinese New Year, and a critical time has been missed when the disease could be restrained within Mr. Uhan with minimum losses.
China's health authorities can learn this rigorous lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, as each word is taken into account by citizens and may affect their attitude and decisions; (2) more carefully monitor and respond to extraordinary information from the clinic rather than to wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive measures to prevent the potential epidemic in early stages of its development, rather than to calm the public; and (4) to conduct more targeted and effective teachings to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and regular verification and improve society response system.
The COVID-19 explosion caused by the previously untrained coronavir of the severe acute respiratory syndrome of the second type (SARS-COV-2) began at the end of December 2019.
Less than two months later, China covered the disease and, at the time of the drafting of the document, it spread in 50 countries of the world.
Since the virus is very similar to a severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to the symptoms of a severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), the COVID-19 experienced the SARS recycling.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are significant in terms of the prevention of epidemic and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than youth and men more than women; the proportion of severe cases and the rate of mortality among older people is also higher than young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
The COVID-19 patients are disseminating the virus even when the disease is unsymptomic, while SARS patients are usually infected only in difficult cases of illness, thus preventing the COVID-19 dissemination of more difficult than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-COV-2 is wider and faster than SARS-COV.
Some COVID-19 patients may have negative normal samples for SARS-COV-2 RNA.
On the other hand, healed patients may again show positive samples of the virus.
All of this significantly increases the risk of the spread of the virus.
In the light of such rapid promotion of COVID-19 studies, some of the important issues are still not resolved, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-COV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of a 96 per cent homologist between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like flagging mice crowns, we still cannot claim that the infection of SARS-CoV-2 has been infected by flying mouses.
What animal has become an intermediate species transmitting the virus from the original host, for example, from flying mouses to humans?
Notwithstanding the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot safely interrupt the transmission path, and the epidemiological situation may be increased at any time.
Molecular modeling and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-COV-2 is connected to ACE2, but how exactly is the virus introduced into the respiratory cells and causes the following pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with the ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure a rapid and precise diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve in the process of transmission from human to human?
Will it be caused by a global pandemic, whether it will disappear as well as SARS or will periodically renew like a flu?
These aspects are primarily important, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other issues.
However, we have no choice but, whatever it is worth, to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
Zootic origin of human coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated coronavirus co-development (CoV) and their carriers, including people, for millenniums.
By 2003, two human coronavirs (HCoV) were known to cause a light disease, such as normal cold.
The explosion of a severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) changed our perception of how catastrophic and dangerous for life can be human coronavirus.
The phenomenon of a severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2) in Central China, at the end of 2019, again drew attention to the coronavirus and surprised us with a high transmission, but weakly expressed patogenity of this virus compared to the SARS-CoV related virus.
The coronavirus infection is a zoosis, and the understanding of its zoo origin will be very useful.
Most of the human coronavirus originate from flying mouses for which they are not pathogeneous.
Some human coronavirs are also known for intermediate reservoirs.
Definition of animal carriers directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
Study of the interaction of animals bearing coronavirus can also light on the patogenesis of the coronavir in humans.
In this review, we give available data on seven human coronavirus, focusing on the history of their discovery, as well as on their zoo origin and the ways of transmission.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing various human coronavirus from the perspective of viral evolution and genome recombination.
This context also addresses today's disease epidemic caused by the coronavir discovered in 2019 (CIVID-19).
Furthermore, the conditions required to successfully change the carriers and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of illness.
The coronavirus refers to the Coronaviridae family, which represents a group of shell viruses with one positive-polar RNA.
These viruses with the largest of RNA-containing genome containing between 26 and 32,000 nucleotics have been named because of their form, which is similar to the crown when dealing with an electronic microscope.
In terms of the structure, coronavirs contain unsegmented genomes with an identical organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large partially open-closing reading frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b) translated into polyprotein replicades pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins marked NSP1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains an open reading framework for structured proteins, including squirrel proteins (S), shell proteins (E), membrane proteins (M) and Nucleoprotein (N).
Other coronavirus lines also encode a number of specific accessor proteins.
Based on differences in protein sequences\ coronaviruss are divided into four species (alpha, beta, gamma and deltacorononavirs), while the type of betacorononavirs includes the majority of human coronavirs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There are philogenetic evidence that the genetic source of the majority of alpha and betacorononavirs are flagging mouses and humidors, while birds are the main tank for gamma and deltacorononavirs.
For thousands of years, coronavirs have continued to overcome intervision barriers, and some of them have evolved to the dangerous patogens for humans.
Seven human coronavirs are known for this day.
These include human alphacorononavirs HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63.
The remaining five betacorononavirs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV), the coronavir of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV) and the cronavir of the severe acute respiratory syndrome of the second type of SARS-COV-2.
Human coronavirus HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause symptoms of light form, such as cold and (or) diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV viruses, MERS-CoV and recently detected SARS-CoV-2 are extremely pathogeneous, cause severe infectious respiratory diseases in relatively larger numbers of patients with a higher probability to develop acute respiratory disease (ORS) and extravolution symptoms.
The first string of human coronavir HCoV-229E, B814, was obtained from a sample separated from a swallow of patients who were cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive studies have accumulated more detailed knowledge of HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 which cause local infection symptoms.
Indeed, there was a generally accepted concept before the explosion of a severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), which deemed human coronavir infected generally harmless.
The SARS explosion in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in the current history; more than 8,000 people were over and the total mortality rate was approximately 10 per cent.
Ten years later, the explosion of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a long epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, and the disease was sporadically spread into the other countries of the world.
The new human coronavir (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-COV-2, was the incinerator of the current coronavir infection epidemic 2019 (COVIID-19), which, as at 3 March 2020, took over 3,100 lives, and the number of infected had exceeded 91,000 people.
The alarm signal is received and the world must be prepared for the coming pandemic of SARS-COV-2.
All seven human coronavirs have zoo origin, their sources are flying mouses, mouses or household animals.
Many data sets indicate the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronavirus from flying mice, whose organisms have well adapted and in which viruses do not manifest pathogenic properties, but demonstrate wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has abandoned China and the world with a severe medical, scientific, social and moral challenge.
The study of the zoo mechanism of human coronavirus origin will allow them to understand their natural history, the forces of their evolution and the factors limiting inter-specific transfer.
It may also indicate or expedite the search for a residue, intermediate and amplifying SARS-COV-2, which is very important to prevent re-proliferation of disease in the future.
This review contains general information on zoo origin, inter-type transfer and patogenesis of human coronavirus.
In particular, we mark and consider the following common characteristics: the original viruses of human coronavirus are usually not pathogeneous for their reservoirs, but acquire pathogenic nature after the inter-type transfer to the new host.
We also analyze the trend of human coronavirus evolution, which often accompanies the improvement of transmission of pathogenic properties.
The result of the current SARS-COV-2 is also considered in the same context.
Animal coronans have been known since the end of the 1930s.
Before the B814 type of HCoV-229E was first obtained from a sample separated from cold-swallowed patients, various coronavirs were found from various infected animals, including Indians, mouses, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronavirs have been identified in the past decades.
Table 1 presents a brief history of the discovery of human coronavirs in chronic order.
The first type of HCoV-229E was obtained from samples taken from respiratory paths of patients with infectious defeat of upper respiratory paths in 1966; the virus was further adapted to the reproduction of WI-38 lung cells.
Patients infected by HCOV-229E had cold symptoms, including headache, sneaking, general insufficience and throat pain, while high temperature and cough were observed in 10 to 20 per cent of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was allocated from organic culture and subsequent serial passage to the brain of potatoes.
Clinical signs of infection with HCoV-OC43 appear similar to HCoV-229E virus, whose symptoms are indifferent from the damage of other respiratory pathogenic pathogens, such as the A influenza virus and rinovirus.
The HCOV-229E virus and HCOV-OC43 have a global spread in the world and are generally transmitted in moderate widths in winter.
The mainly incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week and approximately two weeks of disease.
According to volunteers' studies, healthy people infected by HCOV-229E have developed a common freezing of light form.
Only few patients with low immunity had a severe infection of lower respiratory paths.
The SARS explosion, also known as “athipical pneumonia”, became the first of human history of a well-documented pandemic caused by human coronavirus, and the illness caused the SARS-COV virus, the third of the detected human coronavirs.
The first case of SARS was identified at the end of 2002 in the Chinese province of Guandun.
During the SARS epidemic, 8 096 cases of disease and 774 deaths have been documented and the disease has been spread in many countries and different continents.
Without prejudice to superactive disseminators, it was estimated that each patient could infect approximately two more people; the incubation period was between 4 and 7 days, while the viral load peak was at 10 days of the disease.
Patients infected by SARS-CoV were initially affected by muscle pains, headaches, high temperatures, general insufficience and respiratory disorders, and there were respiratory, cough and respiratory insufficiency.
Laboratory deviations from the standard of SARS are lymphony, liver sample disorders and increased creatinkinasis.
SARS patients also have a difuse alveolar injury, proliferation of epithelial cells and an increase in macrophags.
Approximately 20 to 30 per cent of patients subsequently need intensive therapy and the mechanical ventilation of the lungs.
In such difficult cases,\ in addition to lower respiratory paths, other organs, including stomach and kidney, may also be infected, which is usually accompanied by cytoquine storm, which may be flying, especially for patients with weakened immunity.
For the first time, the virus was allocated from the open biopsy of the lung relatives of a patient who arrived in Hong Kong from Guangjou.
Since then, huge efforts have been aimed at research on human coronavirus.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was allocated to a seven-month child from the Netherlands.
At first, it was established that it was primarily impressed by children of younger age, older people and patients with weakened immunity and respiratory diseases.
The HCoV-NL63 disease is characterized by such manifestations as wetness, conjunctivity, high temperature and bronchiolite.
Another independent study describes the allocation of the same virus from the nazal material taken by an eight-month boy from the Netherlands who suffers from pneumonia.
The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but in fact it was widespread.
According to the estimates, HCoV-NL63 is caused by approximately 4.7 per cent of the widespread respiratory diseases and the peak of the diseases it causes is at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is linked to the obstructive laringite, which is also called a crush.
HCoV-HKU1 was allocated to Hong Kong the same year from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolite.
In addition to the non-moral pneumonia and bronchiolite, HCoV-HKU1 is linked to the exacerbation of asthmatic diseases.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the respiratory diseases of the light form have been identified worldwide.
All these four human coronavirus caused by extra-bolic infections have been well adapted to humans, and their mutation, bringing high pathogenic diseases, is generally unlikely, although the incidents were and their causes were unknown, as in a rare example with a more viral HCoV-NL63 subtype, which, according to recent reports, caused a serious infection of lower respiratory paths in China.
Usually, as acquiring the ability to transmit effectively and preserve in the human body, these human coronavirs become less viral or patogenous.
The Coronavir of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV) was first assigned to Saudi Arabia in 2012 from a light 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal insufficiency.
Most of the laboratory confirmed cases have occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia, there are cases of inflammation and dissemination through episodes of secondary infections in close contacts.
Another secondary flash with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical manifestations of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are similar to the symptoms of a severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) for both infections, which are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
In contrast to SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed a sharp renal insufficiency, which still distinguishes MERS from the other diseases caused by coronavirs transmitted to the person.
Over 30 per cent of patients have abdominal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As at 14 February 2020, more than 2.500 laboratory confirmed cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome with high mortality (34.4 per cent), therefore MERS-COV is considered one of the most fatal viruses known to the person.
During the period from mid-end to the end of December 2019, the Uhanh of the Chinese Province of Hubai, classters of patients with pneumonia were detected, which is now linked to the infection caused by a severe crown of a severe respiratory syndrome of 2th type (SARS-COV-2).
The World Health Organization announced that the continuing infection of lower respiratory paths caused by SARS-COV-2 was a global emergency in public health, and the disease itself was called “coronavir infection 19” (CIVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases have been registered in the world, with approximately 3.4 per cent mortality.
It should be noted that the mortality in the Chinese province of Hubai is 4.2 per cent and is 1.2 per cent beyond it.
SARS-COV-2, like SARS and MERS cornavirus, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by a temperature, cough and dishes.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
The pneumonia is one of the most difficult symptoms and is able to quickly convert into a respiratory insufficient syndrome.
Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, taking into account the high homology of nucleotic sequences (82%), these viruses, however, form different branches of the philogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogeneous, but has greater capacity to transfer compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The cases of non-symptomic infection of SARS-COV-2 have been registered, which indicates the ability of this virus to spread quickly throughout the world.
As a result of the comparison and comparison of SARS-COV-2 with the other six human coronavirs, there are important similarities and differences.
First, human coronavirs have similar incubation period and the duration of the diseases caused by them.
In this regard, SARS-COV-2 demonstrates the same trend as the other six human coronavirus.
Secondly, at the level of COVID-19 symptoms are between SARS-CoV and four human coronavirus caused by extrapatient infections (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, the SARS-COV-2 infection is similar to the fact that the human coronavirus infected with extra-bolic infections, including non-specific manifestations, light symptoms, or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infected, a small subgroup of difficult cases can be allocated to COVID-19, although the ratio is a little below.
Thirdly, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also notes the interesting standards characterized both for human coronavirus causing extrabolic infections and for SARS-COV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-COV-2 is at least as high as human coronavirus caused by extra-bolic infections.
On the other hand, it is still necessary to verify whether the transmission of SARS-COV-2 is reduced with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e. infection of each person), as in cases of SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Finally, like other human coronavirs that cause extra-bolic infections, SARS-COV-2 can be found in the cala patterns.
We still have to answer the question of whether the fecal oral path of SARS-COV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
The issue of the potential seasonality of SARS-COV-2, which is characterized by human coronavirs that cause extra-bolic infections.
However, the future development of the continuing COVID-19 explosion will depend on the SARS-CoV-2 characteristics, including transmission, pathogenicity and sustainable dissemination after the transition of people.
All four human coronavirus, which caused infections with symptoms of light form, have been well adapted to humans.
On the other hand, they may have well adapted to these four human coronavirus.
In other words, those and others could be referred to as the only survivors after the pandemic of human coronavirus in the past.
Human coronavirus that cause severe diseases in humans and people with human coronavirs caused severe diseases simply have not survived.
In order to do so, human coronavirs must replicate in the human body sufficiently to accumulate adaptive mutations that contradict the limitation of the carrier.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-COV-2 explosion and the more people will be infected, the more the chance that the virus is fully adapted to the person.
If it is adapted well, its transfer to people will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other activities to control infectious diseases.
For many years, four extra-bolic coronavirs have circulated in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require animal reservoir.
The high-coated coronavirus of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not adapt sufficiently to a person, and their transfer to humans could not be supported.
They need to remain and reproduce in their zoo tanks and look for a case of inflammation into perceptive human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or enhancing carriers.
SARS-COV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-COV/MERS-COV and four HCOV extra-bolic viruses.
It is very easily transmitted as an extra-body HCoV, at least at present.
But it's more pathogenic than HCoV extra-bolic, and less patogenous than SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
It remains to see if it is adapted fully to a person and would circulate in human environment without a tank or with an intermediate animal bearer.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, we will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutional, natural, intermediate, strengthening and reservoir HCOV viruses.
The animal serves as an evolutionary HCoV bearer if it transmits a neighbouring ancestor from the same high homology at the sequence of Nucleotides.
The ancestor virus is usually well adapted and unpatogenous in this host.
Similarly, the reservoir has continued to carry HCOV for a long time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural HCoV or its parental virus.
Unlike this, if HCOV was only incorporated into the intermediate carrier right before or about the time it was brought to the person, it was not well adapted to the new host and often patogenized.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoo source of human infection and play the role of a stronger carrier, allowing the virus to replicate and then deliver it to people, increasing the scale of human infection.
HCOV may endure a tummy infection if it cannot endure transmission within the intermediate carrier.
On the contrary, HCoV viruses can also adapt to the intermediate carrier and even establish long-term endemicness.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reservoir.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the SARS zero patient had anonymous contact with hunting and industrial animals (wild).
Further surveillance studies have shown that animal traders have the proliferation of IgG antitels to the SARS-CoV virus above the population.
The Himalayan cyvites (Paguma larvata) and the one-wide dog on the living animals markets became the first placed bearers of viruses similar and almost identical SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly reaffirmed by the fact that, after the destruction of all the civic on the markets, SARS cases were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that the Himalayan civet, living in nature or on farms and non-markets, had not been determined in most cases that it was possible to conclude that the Himalayan cyvites could serve only as an intermediate enhancing carrier, not a natural saris-CoV reserve.
It is noteworthy that since 80 per cent of different animals in Guanchjou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, the probability of intermediate carriers can also be used by numerous small peasants.
They all seem to be a clutch of the SARS-COV virus.
The subsequent search for a natural animal bearer of SARS-CoV revealed a close-born CoV flat mouse, which was called the atipical pneumonia of subcutaneous HKU3 mice (SARRR-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and which is present in Chinese subcutaneous flying mouses.
These mouses are positive for the antibodies of SARS-COV and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other flying mouse crowns have 88 to 92 per cent the same homology of the sequences of Nucleotics as the SARS-CoV.
These studies put the foundations of a new concept that the flat mouses became the bearers of new human patogens.
A number of SARS-like coronavirs (SL-CoV) have also been identified with flying mouses, but none of them except one that marks WIV1 can be isolated as a live virus.
It is known that the SARS-COV receptor is a human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1, obtained from the sample of a flagging mice, uses ACE2 flagging mouses, cyvity and human as a cell receptor.
Interestingly, serums of healing patients with SARS could have neutralized WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest family ancestor of SARS-CoV in flying mouses, dividing 95 per cent of the homology of the nucleotic sequences.
Despite high homology between these two viruses, it is generally considered that WIV1 is not a direct parental SARS-COV virus, and the flat mouses are not a direct reserver of SARS-COV.
The Filogenetic Analysis consists of MERS-CoV to the same group as CoV-HKU4 flying mouses and CoV-HKU5 flat mouses.
CoV-HKU4 flying mouse and MERS-COV use the same receptor, dipeptildipeptidase-4 (DPP4) to invade viruses.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerasis of MERS-CoV virus philogeneticly closer to the sequences of betacorononavirs of flying mouses identified in Europe and Africa.
Until now, wild flying mouses have not found a live MERS-COV virus.
The homology of the ERS-CoV sequences and its nearest cousin CoV-HKU25 is only 87 per cent.
Thus, the flat mouses may not be a direct reservoir of the MERS-COV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East showed that single camels were positive to neutralized antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as well as camels of Middle East in many African countries.
The alive MERS-CoV, an identical virus found in humans, has been separated from the nazal mass of the single peasants, which further reaffirms the role of the camels as the true mercury bearers of MERS-COV.
It is also worth noting that there were minor symptoms, but massive viral inflammation, of camels infected with experimental infected MERS-COV.
It is noteworthy that infected camels have allocated the virus not only in a respiratory way but also in a fecal oral way, which is also the main way to allocate the virus to the sticky mouses.
However, there are still issues, since many confirmed cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome had no contact with camels before symptoms occurred and were likely to refer to human transfers or to the unknown channels including unspecified species of animals that were the mercenaries of MERS-COV.
The nucleotic homology of SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% compatible with CoV RATG13 flat mouses allocated by Asian subcoven Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the cases of SARS-COV and MERS-CoV, the diversgence of sequences between SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 is too large to accord parental relations to them.
Thus, the flat mouses could not be a direct SARS-COV-2 tanker unless nearly identical crowns of flagging mouses are found in the future.
Apparently, the direct animal bearers of the SARS-COV-2 should be among wild species sold and deteriorated in the sea-product market in the Uganda, with many initial cases of COVID-19, which indicates the likely transfer from a human being.
Several recent studies, based on metagenomic sequences, concluded that the group threatened the destruction of small peanuts known as pangolin (Manis javanica), could also carry a parent betacorononavir, a related SARS-COV-2.
The homology of the sequences of these new pangolin coronavir genomes is 85 to 92 per cent compared to SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely linked to RATG13, with the identity at the level of nucleotic sequences of about 90 per cent.
They are classified in two differentiations of virus diferences such as SARS-COV-2 in a philogenetic tree, one of which is more close to SARS-COV-2, with 97.4 per cent of the amino acid sequences.
On the contrary, SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 are more different, despite the higher degree of homology of sequences throughout the genome.
In an early study of the diseased pangolins, there was also a report on the definition of viral contigations in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-COV-2.
This study used other methods of collection and manual processing to obtain genome sequence, which includes approximately 86.3 per cent of the full-dimensional virus genome.
It is not possible to exclude that the pangolin has become one of the intermediate SARS-COV-2 animals.
However, due to the divergence of sequences between SARS-COV-2 and pangolin betacoronavirs related to SARS-CoV-2, there is no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-COV-2 of pangolin.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 is even shorter than between SARS-COV-2 and betacorononavirs of pangolin associated with SARS-COV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-COV-2 has not yet been established in flying mouses, pangolins and other peanuts.
While the highest homology of sequences was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacorononavirs of pangolin, related SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, the highest homology of sequences within the entire genom.
Very theoretically, the high degree of similarity between pangolin betacoronavirs, related SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 is related to parallel evolution through selectivity.
The contrary proposal is to recombine between the betacorononavir of pangolin, a related SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As a movement force of evolution, the recombination is widely widespread among betacorononavirs.
There is still no final decision on the direct zoo origin of SARS-COV-2.
In addition to high pathogenic HCOV viruses, the zoo origin of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 is also studied.
Filogenetic evidence shows that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E can come from flagging mice coronavirs, while parental HCoV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 viruses have been found from humility.
It was reported that the coronavirus of flying mouses called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and detected by the North American three-colour accessories demonstrated a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E was genetically linked to another coronavirus of flagging mouses called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that its intermediate carrier could also be a camel.
The modern knowledge of the animal origin of known coronavirs is summarized on drawing 1 and table 2.
The philogenetic analysis provided evidence of the inter-type transmission of HCoV in anamneza.
In 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was registered when inter-visible transmission of HCoV-OC43 and people had been infected from domestic animals.
The history of inter-type transmission of HCOV-229E is not so clear.
Alphacorononavirs of flagging mice were discovered, tight-born HCOV-229E.
There is alphacorononavir alpaka among them.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from flagging mice to a person.
First of all, people, not alpacs, could have contacted flagging mouses in the general environmental thread.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the alpacs.
Secondly, the alphacorononavirs of flagging mice, related to HCoV-229E, are diversified and unpatogenous, while alphacorononavir alpaka caused respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alphacorononavir alpaka has not been discovered in wild animals.
Thus, the alpacs cannot be excluded from humans from alphacorononavir, a relative HCOV-229E.
In fact, the flat mouses are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the rage virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that clusters could directly transmit HCOV-229E to people.
On the other hand, while the alphacorononavirs of flagging mouses could have served a genetic pulp of HCoV-229E virus, alpacians and single-arbitrate camels could become intermediate devices that transmit viruses to people, just as in the case of MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of inter-type transmission from flying mice to single peasants and single camels to man.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from flagging mouses is known by its original identification and then confirmed by subsequent research.
Apparently, flying mouses give a rich pool of virus varieties for inter-specific exchange of genetic fragments and inter-specific transfers.
The long-term, dense inhabitants, close social interaction and the ability to fly are making flying mouses “perfect spreaders”.
On the other hand, the MERS-COV virus was introduced to single camels a decade ago.
It has adapted well to these camels, which have become a stable and natural reservoir from the intermediate carrier.
These animals have a very easily illness and have relatively low frequency of mutation.
His episode transmission to a person is a coincidence, and the person remains a stupid medium of MERS-COV, since its transfer is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transfer of MERS-COV, the role of pangolins, if such, is different in the transmission of the SARS-COV-2 virus.
In particular, the betacorononavirs of pangolins are highly pathogeneous in pangolins.
They may be a dumb bearer of betacorononavirs, related SARS-COV-2, as well as cyvites in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, several inter-type transmissions of SARS-COV-2 from animals should be confirmed or excluded.
First of all, flat mouses can be a reservoir for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical SARS-COV-2.
People can share the environmental thread with the sticky mouses by means of the reputation or the separation of the animals.
Secondly, pangolins may be one of the intermediate enhancing devices in which the SARS-COV-2 relative virus has recently been affected.
People are infected by the virus through a separation of cattle and eating meat of wild animals.
SARS-COV-2 may be perceived by many animals, including households.
The survey of domestic and wild animals against antibodies is justified.
Thirdly, as indicated above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third form that contacted both the sticky mouses and the pangolins.
The search for animal origin of SARS-COV-2 continues.
In addition to different types of animal bearers, three major factors of the virus have also contributed to crossing intervision barriers.
First of all, their relatively high mutation rate in replication of RNA.
In comparison with other viruses with the one-carbon RNA, the calculated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered " moderately high" with the average rate of approximately 10 to 4 replacements per year in one section 2 depending on the adaptation phase of coronavir to new hosts.
Coronavirs have a corrective exoribonucleasis, which leads to an extremely high frequency of mutation and weakening, or even inadequateness.
Interestingly, the nucleotic analog of Remdesivir suppresss the replication of coronavirus by inhibiting this exoribonucleasis and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerasis.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising means against SARS-COV-2, which should be verified during clinical studies.
Nevertheless, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is nearly a million times higher than their carriers.
Furthermore, the frequency of mutation may often be even higher if the coronavirs are not well adapted to the host.
In comparison to SARS-CoV with high frequency of mutation, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently below, which shows a higher level of adaptation to people.
This virus is likely already adapted to another man closer.
In addition to SARS-COV-2, this also applies to MERS-COV well adapted to single camels.
Theoretically unlikely that the vaccines and antiviral products from SARS-CoV-2 will quickly lose their efficiency as a result of the genetic driff.
Secondly, the large RNA genome in coronavirus has increased plastics in genome modification with regard to mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the probability of inter-wide co-development favourable to acquire new coronavirs, if appropriate.
This contributes to the numerous unique opening frameworks for the reading and functioning of proteins encoded in the 3′ end of the genome.
Thirdly, thanks to the unique matrix selection mechanism, coronavirs have accidentally and often switched matrixs during replicating the RNA.
During the transcryption of the DNA of the coronavir in a mixed vessel, there is often a thread switch.
High-specific full-dimensional and subgenomic RNA can recombin and create new coronavirus.
Filogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found both in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and in animal coronavirs, such as SL-CoV and BatCoV-HKU9 flat mouses.
Interaction of the transmission virus
In addition to the three above viral factors, another key factor important for inter-type transfer is the interaction of the virus with the receptor.
This article, as a typical example, which also demonstrates a positive selection in inter-wide transfer events, provides the SARS-COV recombination.
On the basis of a comparative analysis between SARS-COV human species and civilians, the SARS-CoV is considered to be a rapid adaptation in various hosts, especially with regard to mutations on RSD protein S.
In general, the RSD protein S of coronavirus is interacting with the cell receptor, and the response of the antibody of the carrier is intense.
RSD of SARS-CoV is amino acids, with 318th to 510, on S1, which is linked to an angiotensin enzyme 2 (APF2) and its coreceptors.
RSD of the SARS-CoV virus is capable of recognizing APF2 receptors, including flying mouse, cyvites, mouses and one-wide dog, making the possible intervision of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found in RSD, different from human virus and cyvites, and 4 of them are a linking motive for interaction with APF2.
SARS-COV civics have K479N and S487T mutations in RSD, which may increase the affinity of the interaction of the shifted protein with the human receptor APF2.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be particularly important to adapt the virus to the human.
It should be noted that SARS-COV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-COV.
The 30 per cent difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S leads to that the linking protein S to human APF2 could change.
Indeed, a study with a cryoelectronic microscope suggests that the affinity of this connection is 10 to 20 times higher than between APF2 people and the S protein of SARS-COV.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other coreceptors are required to transmit SARS-COV-2.
It is surprising that HCOV-NL63 is also connected to APF2, but with another S protein segment.
There are many other HCoV receptors such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetyl acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronavirus in people after inter-type transfer from animals.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of the HCoV inter-type transfer is also managed by other factors of dependency and limitation.
The divergence of these proteins between humans and natural reservoirs of HCoVs, such as flying mouses, singlerba camels and glossy, may be a barrier for inter-specific transfer.
In order to successfully transmit the HCoV viruses, the factors of dependency must be hurled and subjected to the restriction of the hosts.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categoryd.
Good results can give an impartial full-genome recording of dependency and restrictions for the hosts for SARS-CoV-2 through the latest CRISPR technology.
New HCOV emergence: back to zero mark
The diversity of crawling mice crowns creates a wide range of possibilities for new HCoV.
In this sense, the coronavirs of flagging mouses are a genetic pool for HCoV.
Furthermore, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also a movement force of HCoV evolution and are two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has a potential for radical modification of virus phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, the ORF8 is considered important for human adaptation, since ORF8 is isolated, but it is established that they are coded by different ORF8 proteins.
A 29-nucleotic delegation, characterized the coronavirs of SARS-COV, was found in the isolated species at the beginning of human epidemic.
This delegation breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is considered to be an adaptive mutation that accelerates the shift of the hosts.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha and gammacorononavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinants have been identified in the RNA-dependent RNA.
Localization of the recombination was also defined in nonstructural proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, the epidemic MERS-COV had been subjected to recombinant events between different lines, which had occurred in single camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCoV, where HCoV recombined with other animals in their non-structural genes.
It is also necessary to warn that the artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in virus genomes, which is likely due to the elimination of the virus from selective pressures, such as the immune system of the carrier.
An example of such effects is the loss of full ORF4 in the prototype HCoV-229E through a binucleotic delegation.
While an intact open ORF4 reading framework can be observed in flat mouse and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alphacorononavir of the alpaca demonstrates a single-nucleotic insertion, which leads to a movement of the framework.
Finally, the development of new HCoV is also due to the pressure of selecting on their tanks.
Infected by flying coronavir mice, weakly expressed symptoms or absence of them have been registered, which indicates mutual adaptation between coronavirs and flying mouses.
It turns out that anatomically and physiologically adapted mice to coronavirs.
For example, the defects of the inflammatory response in flagging mouses effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronavirs.
Furthermore, the natural activity of the killer cells in flying mouses has been depressed by the inhibitor receptor of NKG2/CD94 natural killers and the low level of the expression of the main gystocompatibility complex of I class.
Furthermore, the high level of active oxygen, which is provided by high metabolic activity of flagging mouses, may overcome the replication of the coronavir, simultaneously affecting the ecsoribonucleasis reading, thus creating the selection pressure for the generation of virus species that are highly pathogeneous when inleting into the new carrier.
The more pathogenic cronavir species can also evolve because of the recombination, leading to acquisition of new proteins or protein properties for the adaptation of the carrier.
Thus, it is not an accident that three new human coronavirus have emerged in the last twenty years.
Coronavirs are unpatogenous or cause light symptoms in their tanks, such as sticky mouses or camels.
They are confidently replicated without having a strong immune response from the host.
This is the secret why we see unsignificant carriers and which causes difficult human infection.
The severe symptoms are mainly associated with the hyperactivation of immune reaction and the cytokin storm, with immune response, more seriously the loss of the lungs.
On the contrary, the immune response to the replication of the coronavir is not implicable.
The same immune response strategy may have favourable effects in therapy against SARS-COV-2.
Flying mouses have a strong interferon response.
Thus, the adoption of an interferon I of type, at least at the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2, should have a favourable effect.
Furthermore, NLRP3-inflammasom has been violated with flying mouses.
Based on this, the inhibition of NLRP3-inflammasom through MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The development of SARS-COV-2 follows the common scheme of SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
While the betacorononavir of flying mouses was found, the nucleotic homology of which 95 per cent compared with SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavir of flying mouses, the nucleotic homology of which corresponds to 96 per cent of SARS-CoV-2.
Although civilians and other animals were found to carry viruses on the market, SARS-CoV identical, they were not directly established for SARS-CoV-2.
The betacorononavirs of pangolin were discovered, amazingly homological SARS-CoV-2, which suggests that the pangolines could serve as one of the intermediate carriers or that the fragments of the betacorononavir genes of pangolin could enter the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining issues, there is no evidence that SARS-COV-2 was intended or accidentally created by a person.
The coronavirus has drawn general attention to themselves because of the recent SARS-COV-2 explosion.
Study of coronavirs in flying mouses and other animals dramatically changed our perception of the importance of zoo origin and animal reservoirs of HCOV in human transfer.
Convincing evidence showed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-COV-2 were transferred to a person through intermediate mediators.
If the SARS-CoV infection comes from the contact between people and market civilians, the closure of wild markets and destruction of cyvity on them could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the opening of various lines of betacorononavirs of pangolin, close-born SARS-COV-2, the pangolins should be removed in order to prevent zoo transmission of infection from product markets.
However, whether SARS-COV-2 is transmitted to a person through pangolins and other sycerers and how this may remain the challenge of future studies.
On the other hand, the MERS-COV virus has long existed in single camels.
These camels are an important vehicle, as well as the main source of meat, milk, skin and wolves for the local population.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels for control of MERS, as it was done in the wild animals markets of China to prevent the spread of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
In order to stop ERS periodic explosions, an integrated approach should be taken to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels combined with other infectious control measures.
Since we can't eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may occur, causeing illness.
The world is circulated by different zoo viruses.
Especially variety of cronavirs of flying mouses with zoo capabilities are incredibly diverse.
There is a great number of opportunities for evolution and recombination of these zoo coronavirs, which will in the future lead to new coronavirs that are more transmitted and (or) more deadly for humans.
In order to reduce the number of excessive contacts between humans and animals, the culture of the use of wild animals in some areas of China should be rejected.
After severe tests, the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 need better preparedness and response plan for such situations.
In fact, many viruses existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural tanks until new territories are captured.
Although many flagging mouse properties are favourable for the spread of viruses, learning people to stay away from them can minimise the probability of human contact with sticky mouses and other species of wild animals.
In order to better understand the ecology of coronavirus and their natural carriers, the continuous epidemiological surveillance of peasants is needed, which will be useful to prevent transmission of coronavirs from humans and future diseases.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the environmental reservations of natural viruses.
Some fragments are still missing in the puzzle of the zoo origin of SARS-COV-2.
First of all, if the flat mouses have transmitted the ancestor virus SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it is interesting to see in which circumstances the flat mouses and pangolines split the same environmental thread.
Secondly, if the flat mouses play a more direct role in transmission to a person, it is necessary to determine how people became in contact with the sticky mouses.
Thirdly, if the role of the true intermediate carrier plays a third syringe, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different types, including humans, flying mouses and pangolins.
Finally, since many peasants, including domestic animals, may be perceptive to SARS-COV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infections should be carried out.
Whether a flying mouse, pangolin or other syringe, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its predecessor viruses will be identified by their natural carriers.
Further studies in this area will light on the evolutionary path of SARS-COV-2 in animals, which will have important consequences for prevention and control of COVID-19.
Diagnostic criteria for “suspicion of disease” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our group published a brief guide for diagnostic and treatment of the new coronavir infection of 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information on our experience and recommendations to combat this pandemic throughout the world.
However, the coronavirus infection of 2019 (CIVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of current studies and clinical experiences, thus diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and introduced the latest diagnostic criteria for “suspicion of disease” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the document “Recommendation on diagnostic and therapy for COVID-19” (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the CNC.
In December 2019, the new coronavir 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was now officially named coronavir infection 2019 (CIVID-19), and the virus disease itself was called “a severe acute respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-COV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat the infection of SARS-COV-2, our group developed a brief guide and published it on the Internet on the Military Medical Research website on 6 February 2020.
This publication drew great attention to itself.
Notice, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have progressively increased on the basis of current studies and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
For example, between 16 January and 3 March 2020, seven issues of the document “Recommendations on diagnostic and therapy for COVID-19” published by the National Health Committee of the CNB (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), and the content of some of its provisions have been significantly changed.
Recently, the work prepared by Jou (Zhou) with the co-autors commented on our recommendations, which contained simple diagnostic proposals based on the already existing clinical experience.
This work added new practical witnesses to our recommendations, as well as presented valuable background information on this pandemic covered the world.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our appreciation.
However, according to the latest issue of the COVID-19 Diagnostic and therapy Recommendations (seventh test version) and the results of the ongoing studies, and their work is needed to be updated.
In accordance with the seventh issue of this document (3 March 2020), a single element of epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of disease should be connected to a comprehensive analysis when confirming the disease suspicion:
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of movement or placement in Mr. Uhan and its districts or other residential areas, where cases of COVID-19 were registered 14 days before symptoms; (2) the history of contacts with patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 (positive test based on nuclein acids); (3) the history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Mr. Uhan and its districts or other residential items where cases of COVID-19 have been registered during the last 14 days before the symptoms; (4) the history of contact with groups with confirmed diseases (≥ 2 cases characterized by high temperature or respiratory symptoms registered during 2 weeks in small areas, such as house or apartment, office, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) External infection of COVID-19; (3) the total number of leucocytes is normal or reduced with reduced lymphocytes at the early stage of the symptoms.
The diagnosis for the confirmed case of disease should be based on a suspicion of one of the following pathogenic or serologic evidence, namely: (1) the PCR test in real-time is positive for SARS-COV-2; (2) the full-genom sequence of the virus shows high homogenity of new coronavirs; (3) positive results of the serotest for specific SARS-CoV-2 antitels IgM and IgG; or the change of the results of the test from negative to a specific SARS-CoV-2 antibody IgG, or the increase of titra is not less than 4 times at the stage of healing of the relevant acute phase.
It can also be noted that, in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) the issues of the document were added to the PCC test in real time for Nuclein Acids in respiratory paths or blood samples.
The patogenetic blood sample diagnosis was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020) issues and then the need for seological evidence was added to the seventh issue.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers who were looking for a optimum set for detecting nuclein acids in a rapid diagnosis set, as well as on the testing of respiratory samples, including the selection of blood samples, which increases the availability of various samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive tests for specific antibodies in the criteria for the confirmation of disease.
However, there are increasing evidence of the need to be cautious in treating patients with atypic symptoms and patients without symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in the work of Jou (Zhou) and so on, should be updated, since the person with no clinical symptoms is classified as a group of low risks.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practices and studies.
In conclusion, we hope to obtain more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
As regards diagnostic of “suspicion of disease” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations given in countries where they live.
Our group will also update its recommendations in time to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reported five new death cases as a result of COVID-19 - daily maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new death cases as a result of COVID-19 per day.
It's the largest number of deaths from the virus a day.
As at yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for epidemiology, control and illness studies (IEDCR) reported that 114 current cases were included in the registered infections, as well as 33 healthy patients who were at home.
17 deaths were registered.
In an online briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said that four men and one woman were victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two who were older than 60 years old, two aged between 51 and 60, and one aged 41 and 50 years old.
She also reported that two of the dead were from Dakka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Clinic Officer informed the local news agency Annadolla that one of the victims was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission in the Kuwait Clinic of Meitry.
On Saturday, on the online statement, the Minister for Traffic Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh, Obiduel Quader, said that public transport will be terminated for a longer time than planned in the beginning, until the next Saturday.
Public transport has been suspended since 26 March and had to be resumed on Saturday, 4 April.
Transport of goods of the first need — medicinal products, fuels and foods — was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 were registered in Bangladesh on 8 March in two persons who returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
As at 19 March, these three have already recovered.
SARS-COV-2 crossed a million-life of infections throughout the world
According to the University of Jones Hopkins, on Thursday the total number of infections of coronavir infected by SARS-COV-2 over one million per world.
The COVID-19 coronavirus killed at least 52,000 people.
Abroad came the same day when the first infection case was confirmed in Malawi, and the first death of the coronavir was found in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that as a Thursday, it was one of the few countries in which there were no cases of coronavir infection.
As at yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1 051 635 confirmed infections, including 79 332 cases for twenty-four hours previous to 10:00 for Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavir infected were registered, of which at least 5,900 had a flying outcome.
CBS News, referring to the data of the University of Jones Hopkins, reported that more than 1,000 deaths caused by coronavir infection were reported on Wednesday in the United States.
Countries throughout the world have announced increased measures to prevent disease dissemination.
On Thursday, mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobinin extended the regime of isolation of citizens of the city by 1 May.
Previously, President Vladimir Putin stated that, despite self-izolation, Russians would receive a salary up to 30 April.
Parliament of Portugal voted for the prolongation of an emergency situation for 15 days; the results of the vote were 215 votes " for ", ten abstentions and one " against " .
Saudi Arabia has extended the command clock in the holy towns of Macka and Medina for a full day, while the early command hours only lasted from 3 hours to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to introduce a command clock from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m.
The Governor of the State of Ohio, Mike Dewein, announced that the domestic isolation regime in the state is extended by order to 1 May.
The stores in Australia limit the number of packages of toilet paper that can be acquired at once
On Sunday and Saturday night, the Australian shop networks Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of packages of toilet paper that could be acquired once in all shops of the country, to two and one packages accordingly.
On Monday, ALDI also limited one pack.
These restrictions were reported in posts and on the Facebook website.
Citizens have reportedly started to make extraordinary stocks because of the fears that COVID-19 could lead to the introduction of a general self-izolation regime.
On Wednesday, the Woolworths network also limited the amount of purchased toilet paper to one package.
Earlier, on 4 and 5 March, Woolworths and Coles have already limited this number with 4 packages.
The Coles Trade Network, in its press release of 8 March, reported that, with the introduction of four packaging limits, “in many stores, the toilet paper is still exhausted too quickly — one supplies in an hour”, and said that the demand was "unprecedental", while ALDI in the Facebook post published on Tuesday, called this trend "unexpected".
According to the representative of Woolworths, a sharp increase in sales was observed last week.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also limited the number of two packages.
In order to fulfil the deficit, Coles began to order larger parties to suppliers and to increase the frequency of supplies, Woolworths ordered additional parties, while ALDI made stocks for the special sale of early environmental sales.
Russell Cimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Ritel Association, said that the rhythmers were trying to fill stocks, but it was difficult for local authorities' restrictions on the schedule of the transport of trucks.
It awaits the increase in productivity, since suppliers are trying to meet the demand, but there are increasingly fewer profitable proposals available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, due to the exhaustion of stocks, some stores could not be able to operate on the Wednesday.
In the News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, expert on trade in goods from the Queensland Technology University, said that shops are filling stocks every night.
He noted that the toilet paper was a gross goods, so the number of storage stocks was small, and after all the sales, the long series of shelves remained empty, reinforcing the lack of stocks.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if the sheets could be filled, and goods such as toilet papers and disinfective tools could be placed on these sheets in large quantities, buyers would probably not panic," said Russell Cimmerman.
Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of the reconstructed toilet paper Who Gives a Crap reported the end of the stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, Cleenex and Solaris Paper, also producers of the Sorbent Market, reported that they worked around a day to ensure sufficient amounts of goods.
Domain.com, the real estate sales site, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne decreased because of the absence of buyers on the week of the Labour Day, some sellers began offering a free toilet paper to the first auctioners.
The fourth daily NT News printed in Darwin included an eight-page card to cut and use as a toilet paper.
According to the ABC Australia report dated 3 March, the stores first were unwillingly imposed restrictions on the amount of acquired goods, claiming that they were not planning to do so.
Russell Cimmerman added that other products also have increased demands, including medical masks, disinfecting tools for hands, galanteries, washing hands and torture.
Similarly, in addition to events in Australia, on Sunday night, it was observed that the online store of the British Ocado supermarket also restricted the sale of the toilet paper Andres with two packages of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization announces the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 infectious disease pandemic caused by the Crown-CoV-2 SARS.
Although the term “pandemia” characterizes only the scale of disease rather than the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that the Governments of countries need to take action:
“All countries are still in a position to influence the progress of pandemic.”
This is possible if countries are to investigate the detection, testing, treatment, isolation of sick people, monitoring the occurrence of disease, as well as mobilization of their citizens," WHO Director-General, Mr. Tedros Adan Gabriel, explained.
“We are deeply concerned about both the dissemination and seriousness of illness and the disturbance level.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases, this pandemic is “unprecedental”.
He said, in his interview on CNN in February, that “no one other respiratory virus except the flu has yet been monitored from its emergence until the continuous global spread”.
Mr. Gabriel expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never observed the pandemic caused by the coronavir.
We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before."
First, in January, WHO announced the explosion of this illness in the field of public health, which was of international importance, and then acquired a new status, a pandemic.
The Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauchi, said, “This is only the beginning, it will be worse.”
According to the Associated Press on Thursday, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 have been registered. More than 4.600 people have expired.
The pandemic of the coronavir 2019-2020 is currently a pandemic of coronavir disease 2019 (CIVID-19), caused by a severe coronavir severe respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The flash was detected in Uhaan, China, in December 2019, and on 30 January 2020, an emergency of international public health, which was subsequently recognized as a pandemic.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were registered in 210 countries and regions, which resulted in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people were healed.
The mortality rate in China is 4 per cent, while it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficult breathing.
The possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory dystress syndrome.
From the first occurrence of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but it may also varies between two and fourteen days.
No vaccine or specific treatment are currently found.
The primary treatment is a symptomatical and supportive nature. The recommended preventive measures include laundering of hands, covering mouth at cough, respecting the distance between people, identifying and ensuring self-isolation of people suspected of their infection.
The authorities worldwide responded to the situation by introducing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, command hours, risk control and closing of various facilities.
The Pandemia has led to serious global socio-economic implications, transfer or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as to the widespread lack of goods that have been exacerbated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities were closed at national or regional levels in 193 countries, which affected approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's students.
On the Internet, disinformation on the virus, xenophobia and discrimination had occurred against Chinese citizens, other citizens of East and South-Eastern Asia, or people resembled outside, and other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of spread of virus have been observed.
As a result of reducing the number of travel and closing of heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions decreased.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities of Uhan (the capital of the province of Hubay), China, reported the incidence of pneumonia for unknown reasons, and in early January 2020, the situation was investigated.
Infections were mainly linked to the sea-products of Juanan, so the virus was believed to have zoo origin.
The virus that caused the explosion of the disease known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a recently open-up virus that has been similar to the coronavirus of the flaming mouse, the coronavirus of pangolin and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first case of disease occurred on 1 December 2019, and the infected did not visit the market after that date.
Two thirds of the infections registered in December 2019 were related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, the South-Chinese Office of the Morning Post, whose information was not verified, suggested that the first infectious case occurred with 55-year-old Hubai province 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new infections in China had decreased, but was unexpectedly growing in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new infections outside China was the first time to exceed the number of new infections in China.
The number of cases of disease may be significantly reduced, in particular due to a number of cases with lowly expressed symptoms.
By 26 February, there were relatively few cases of youth infected, with patients who were 19 and younger, less than 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide. The United Kingdom's primary scientific adviser Patrick Wallans estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected until the effective group immunity was formed in the country.
The statistics include infections of people who have been checked on COVID-19 and whose test has been positive under official protocols.
As at 23 March, no country has been able to check more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, an official policy that prescribes not to test only small symptoms.
Study published on 16 March showed that in China until 23 January, 86 per cent of the infections of COVID-19 had not been discovered and that such unregistered patients became a source of infection for 79 per cent of registered cases.
The statistics analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of actual infections in Italy was significantly higher than the number of registered cases.
The initial estimates of the base reproductive infection (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
The study published by the United States Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases is expected to be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 are healthy.
In other more complicated cases, the period from the beginning of the symptoms to the moment of death was between 6 and 41 days, the most frequent period of 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were associated with COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of the deaths of persons aged 60 years and 75 per cent of the victims had associated diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official data on the mortality of COVID-19 pandemic generally include data on the deaths of patients with positive results of the COVID test carried out under official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not take into account the dead people who have not been tested, for example, in the case of death at home, in houses of older people, etc.
Incomplete data in Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID rates 4 to 5 times.
The Press Secretary of the United States Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) recognizes: “We know that [the number of the dead] is below the actual”; its words are confirmed by reports of some single cases in the United States. Similar accounts are often seen in pandemic, such as the epidemic of pig flu H1N1 2009. The first confirmed death was registered in Uhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside the country was registered on 1 February in the Philippines and outside Asia on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths were registered outside the country: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions in all continents, except Antarctica, reported death cases, and several methods are usually used for quantitative mortality assessment.
All indicators are different depending on the region and the period of dissemination of disease, and they also affect the levels of testing, quality of health systems using the treatment schemes, from the beginning of the disease and the parameters of the population, such as the age, gender and general health. The rate of death/illity is the number of deaths shared with the number of diagnostic infections during the time interval.
According to the statistics of the University of Jones Hopkins, as at 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204).
Data in different regions differ.
In China, the mortality rate decreased from 17.3 per cent (for those who had symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those who had symptoms since 1 February 2020). Other methods include the determination of the rate of mortality due to the disease (CFR) — the percentage of diagnosed patients dying from disease and the rate of mortality of infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (as diagnosticated and non-diagnosed) patients.
These statistics are not bound for specific time and reflect the indicators of certain population groups from the time of infection until the disease is completed.
Some scientists tried to calculate these indicators on specific human groups.
According to the Centre for Proof Medicine of the Oxford University, the rate of mortality from this pandemic is generally between 0.1 and 0.39 per cent.
The summary of this range is consistent with the results of the first arbitrary test on COVID-19 in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analysing the impact of CFR assessment.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and precise duration of the explosion shall not be determined and may be different depending on the location.
Macey Boni, a Pennsylvania University Officer, claims that “incontrolled infectious flashes usually go to the plate and then, when the number of available diseases is completed, they begin to turn out.
However, in the present situation, it is practically impossible to make any reasonable forecasts about when this will happen."
The Chinese Government Senior Medical Adviser, Jun Nansan, argues that “everything can end until June” if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on the cessation of the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kučarski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, stated that SARS-COV-2 would “will circulate, perhaps, for a year or two”.
According to the study conducted by the Imperial College under Nile Ferguson ' s leadership, ' until the vaccine is established (possibly 18 months or more)', the physical distance measures and other measures will be required.
William Shaffner, a member of the University of Vanderbilt, believes: “I don't think that this coronavirus will ever disappear forever, since it is so easily transmitted”, as well as that it “can become a seasonal disease, exploding every year.”
The virality of new flashes will depend on collective immunity and degrees of mutation.
The COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively unspecific, and some infected people may suffer disease without symptoms.
Two most common symptoms are increased temperature (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include tiredness, wetness education in breathing paths (lips), loss of smell, breathing, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, vomiting, mutilation, bleeding, diarrhea or kyanosis. WHO claims that it is seriously ill with the development of respiratory problems about each sixth person.
The United States Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) list urgent symptoms such as breathing difficulty, continuous pain or breast density, sudden sense of consciousness, awakening difficulties and drowning of the face or lips. With these symptoms, medical assistance should be immediately contacted. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepssis, septic shock and death.
Some infected people may have a disease without symptoms, but the results of the tests confirm the infection, so the doctors recommend that persons who are in close contact with patients whose diagnosis are confirmed under strict control and survey infections.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of non-symptomic disease occurs from several units to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (time between the infection and the symptoms of symptoms) declines from one to 14 days; it usually consists of five days; yet there is no full clarity on the symptom of loss of smell: initially estimated the percentage of patients with COVID-19 with this symptom was 30 per cent, and then decreased to 15 per cent.
Some details of the dissemination of disease are still unknown.
It is considered that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small drops of air-shaped coughing, chishing or during the conversation; close contact is meant to contact between 1 and 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, drops can be spread from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet) at open cough.
There are assumptions that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops thrown into the air during the conversation that are able to stay in the air for longer time. The respiratory drops can also be produced during the breath, including during the conversation, while the virus is usually not carried out by air.
The drops can get in the mouth or noses of some people, as well as in the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiovascular reanimation (HLR) may lead to exhaust products and therefore to air-proliferation.
It can also enter the body if the person is concerned with the polluted surface, including the skin, followed by his eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus can be transmitted through fecalies, but the risk of transmission is considered low.
The Government of China denies the possibility of oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most infected in the first three days after symptoms, although it may occur before symptoms occur and at a later stage of disease.
There were cases when the tests were positive for three days before symptoms occurred, and this indicates the possibility of transmission of the virus before the symptoms were expressed.
There are only a few reports of laboratory confirmed cases of non-symptomic disease fluid, but in some countries, there were also cases of transmission of disease from non-symptomic carriers.
The European Centre for Prevention and Control of Disease (ECDC) staff claim that it is not quite clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one is usually infected by 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive on surfaces from a few hours to a few days.
In particular, it was discovered that on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on the non-solvent steel (304) the virus is able to live up to three days, on the card surface for one day and on the copper surfaces up to 4 hours.
These data, however, varies depending on the moisture and temperature, and the home and other animals have received positive results from COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to people, although the British authorities advise to wash their hands after contacting animals, just like after contacting other surfaces that the infected people could touch.
The severe severe respiratory cornavir syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new virus first discovered in three people with pneumonia from a group with sharp respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All signs of a new SARS-COV-2 are encountered in nature in relative coronavirs, and outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed by a home sauce that dissolves its protective shell. SARS-COV-2 has a great similarity with the original SARS-COV virus.
It is expected to have zoo origin.
The genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it was genetically classified with Betacoranavirus, the subnational of Sarbecovirus (the B cell line) together with two other types of flagging mice viruses.
At the full genome level, it is 96 per cent identical to other specimens of a flying mouse crown (BatCov RATG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the genome of pangolin and human viruses.
The full genome comparison to today has shown that the largest percentage of similarity (92%) is between the coronavir of pangolin and SARS-CoV-2, but that is not enough to prove that the pangolines are intermediate owners of the virus.
The virus can be diagnosed priorly on the basis of symptoms, although this should eventually be confirmed by analysing a polymerate chain reverse transcryption (RT-PCR) infected secret or computer томography.
The studies comparing the PCP and CTC methods applied in Uhaan show that the CTC is much more sensitive than the PRC, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions are in line with other pneumonia and disease flowing processes.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College has issued a recommendation “do not use CTs for recording or as a method of testing the first line in COVID-19 diagnosis”.
WHO published several RNA testing protocols on SARS-CoV-2, and the first was published on 17 January.
Polymerate chain reaction tests are conducted in real-time mode (RT-PCR).
It can be conducted on respiratory samples and on blood samples.
The results are usually ready for a period of hours to a few days.
The test is usually used by a nose-swallowed swallow, although a number of laboratories and companies can also be used by a serological tests that allow antibodies to be detected.
As at 6 April 2020, none of them had been sufficiently accurate to receive the approval for the worldwide application.
In the United States, the serological test developed by Cellex was approved for urgent use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of visualization of rentgenograms and computer tomography (CT) include asymetrical peripheral distortions of the type of math glass and the lack of pleural exhaust.
The International Base of Photos of Confirmed Infections has been drawn up by the Italian Radiological Society.
Because of similar infections, such as adenovirus, in the identification of the COVID-19 photos not confirmed by the PCR tests, there is a limited clinical specification.
There was a major study in China comparing the CT breast cell and the testing of the PRC, and it was found that, although the images are less specific in the case of infection, they could be decrypted faster; they were also more sensitive, and, therefore, this method of diagnostic can be considered as a tool for drawing in infected areas.
In order to diagnose the virus using X-rays and computer tomography, vertical neuron networks were developed on the basis of artificial intelligence.
The prevention strategies include maintaining a common personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, use in coughing or sneaking ulcers that should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may already have been infected should wear a medical mask in human places.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended that many Governments refrain from any immediate trip to countries and areas affected by the explosion and limit the movement of citizens.
Nevertheless, the virus was able to spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is widespread among the population, some of whom do not know where or how they have been infected, and that healthcare professionals who can be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, as well as to prevent and further dissemination of the infection source.
The use of data from Governments on the location of citizens with their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about the compliance of confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International (International Amnesty), as well as more than 100 other organizations, have made statements that require this type of observation.
A number of mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and proposed; as at 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have worked on the development of decisions to ensure the confidentiality of personal data, for example, the registration of user closeness to other mobile phones through Bluetooth technology.
If the mobile phone user was in close contact with the person whose test on COVID-19 has been positive, it receives the corresponding notification. There are also unfounded versions of how to prevent the infection, for example, the scratch of the nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.
The COVID-19 vaccine does not exist at present, although many organizations are working on its creation.
The laundering of hands is recommended in order to prevent the spread of disease.
CDC (Center for control and prevention of diseases) also recommends the more frequent washing of hands with sauce and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with severe hand pollution, and before food, after smoking, coughing or sneaking.
This is necessary, as the virus is destroyed by a home sauce that opens its protective shelter.
Furthermore, if sauce and water are not available, CDC recommends use of disinfective means for alcoholic hand processing with at least 60 per cent of the spirt content.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, noses or mouths with dirty hands.
The surfaces may be disinfected by a number of solutions (on the surface of the non-running steel, the disinfecting agent starts to operate a minute after the intake) with 62 to 71 per cent of ethanol, 50 to 100 per cent of isopropanol, 0.1 per cent of sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 per cent of hydrogen oxygen and 0.2 to 7.5 per cent of yodium vision.
Other components, such as benzalconium chloride and glucones, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, in the case of suspicion of COVID or its confirmation in the establishment, such as office or daily station, all spaces of such a premises, including offices, toilets, general use facilities, electronic equipment, such as panels, sensors, keyboards, remote controls and bankomates used by sick people, be disinfected.
Medicinal organizations recommend that, when coughing or sneaking, the mouth and nose be covered by the back side of the elbow or the salvet and immediately discard the hygiene objects used.
Those who may have been infected are recommended to use medical masks, as the use of the mask may limit the volume and range of dissemination of breathing products that are displaced in the air when talking, chewing and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Steven Griffin, a virusologist from the University of Lids, “the use of a medical mask may reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces, and touching the face with dirty hands is also the main way of infection.” The masks are also recommended for the use of those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends healthy people to wear medical masks only if they are highly risked, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of a mask actually reduces the number of touches to the person.
Several countries began calling for the use of medical masks in public places.
The CDC centres, U.S., recommend that wear fabric fabric masks of non-medical appointment. China separately emphasized the importance of the use of single health masks with healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with other people.
In Hong Kong, medical masks are recommended in public transport or human places.
In the field of health, Thailand officials call on people to make facial tissue masks in domestic conditions and to erase them every day.
Citizens in the Czech Republic and Slovakia are not allowed to leave outside without masks closing their noses and mouths.
On 16 March, the Government of Vietnam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria compelled all visitors of food shops to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks are produced from mid-Marth, all passengers in trains and intergrad buses were required to use medical masks.
In Panama, the inhabitants are obliged to wear a medical mask on the street; the inhabitants who cannot acquire masks were recommended to sew them alone under domestic conditions.
Medical masks are also widely used by Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is a measure to combat the infection to reduce the spread of disease by minimising close contacts between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, school closure, jobs, stadiums, theatre and trade centres.
People can use social distance measures by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding human places, using incontact greeting and physically distant from others.
Many Governments of regions, particularly affected by explosion, are currently prescribed or recommended social distances.
The maximum number of people that can be gathered in one place in accordance with the recommendation of the United States Government and Health Organizations has been rapidly reduced from 250 people (in regions where no COVID-19 dissemination), to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited the collection of more than two groups. The elderly people and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart diseases, respiratory diseases, hypertension and a weakened immune system are facing an increased risk of a virus in a serious form. The CDC recommends that they stay at home as long as possible if there is an explosion of heart disease. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health bodies have started to replace the use of the term “social distance” to “physical distance”, thus specifying the purpose of this measure to reduce physical contacts within social communications, either by virtual communication or with physical distance.
The use of the term “social distance” was thus understood that people should be exposed to full social isolation rather than to remain in contact with other people in alternative ways. Some departments have published the guidelines on sexual health that should be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, it was recommended that only your permanent partners whom you live, and whom you are confident that he has no virus and symptoms.
Persons with COVID-19 diagnosis and suspects that they are infected recommended isolation under domestic conditions.
Health agencies have published detailed instructions on appropriate self-isolation, and the Governments of many countries have also made mandatory orders or have recommended that the population of the affected regions themselves be placed on the quarantine.
Persons in high-risk groups were prescribed by the strict quarantine.
Persons who may have contacted the infected COVID-19 or recently visited the country or region, significantly affected by the epidemic, have been recommended that the quarantine be found within 14 days since the last possible contact.
Strategies for combating flash include constraints to the dissemination, depression or mitigation of disease.
Pressure of the dissemination is carried out in early stages and aims at tracking and isolation of infected, as well as implies other infectious control and vaccination measures to stop the dissemination of diseases among the rest of the population.
At the stages where the dissemination of the disease is not possible, efforts are addressed to mitigate the consequences: measures aimed at slowing the dissemination and mitigating the effects of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Measures to prevent and mitigate the effects of the dissemination of the disease may be taken simultaneously.
The infection pressure requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of infections to the level below 1. Part of the efforts to manage the explosion of infectious disease is aimed at reducing the peak of epidemic, known as the equation of the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overloading health services and provide more time to develop vaccines and treatment methods.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help to address the flash; including personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, medical masks and self-isolation; public measures aimed at physical distance, such as the closure of schools and the cancellation of mass activities; the involvement of the community to facilitate such measures and participation in them; and measures to protect the environment, such as the cleaning of surfaces. After the seriousness of the explosion has become evident, there have been more responsive actions aimed at restraining the explosion, such as the isolation of cities and the introduction of strict prohibitions for travel.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the proliferation of the virus.
In South Korea, mass carriage and localized quarantines have been introduced, as well as have been organized a system of notifications on displacement of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support was provided to infected individuals who were in isolation and who did not.
In Taiwan, medical masks were increased and punished for accumulation of excessive medicinal products. The model on Britain and the United States showed that there are serious problems with the mitigation (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and the depression (suspension of the growth of the epidemic).
Optimal policy to mitigate the effects of the dissemination of the disease may reduce the high load of the health system by 2/3, while the mortality is double, but still leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapse in health systems.
The pressure may be preferable, but it must be used until the virus circulates among the population (or until the vaccine is developed, if it occurs earlier), as otherwise the spread of the disease will be resumed quickly when measures are weakened.
The long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic leads to social and economic costs.
There are no antivirus medicines approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including the testing of existing medicines.
Receiving unreceptural medicines from cold, drinking enough liquidity and rest may help to facilitate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid introduction and respiratory support.
The use of steroids can only harm.
Several links that have previously been approved to treat other virus diseases are also considered to be used for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and domestic resources” could facilitate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers the improvement of the capacity and adaptation of health to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a major response to the illness explosion.
The European Centre for Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC) and the European Regional Bureau of WHO have released guidelines for the clinical and primary health care services to facilitate the transfer of resources at several levels, including the focus of laboratory services on testing for COVID-19, the cancellation of urgent procedures, where possible, the detection of virus and isolation of patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as improving intensity therapy by training and increasing the number of available IVL equipment and cock.
There are various theories of where the first infection infection could occur — the so-called “null patient”.
The first known infection of a new coronavir infection was probably on 1 December 2019 in the city of Hubay Province.
During the month, the number of infections by coronavir in the province of Hubai has gradually increased.
They were mainly linked to the global sea-products of Juanan, which was also sold by living animals, and one of the theories was that the virus was invaded into the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus had a zoo origin. On 26 December, the Hubae Province Clinic registered a case of mass disease of unknown origin with which the doctor Jean Tenzin had worked on 27 December, reported in the Centre for Control and Prevention of Cianchan disease in the city of Uhan.
On 30 December, a group of doctors from the central clinic of Uhan warned their colleagues of “coronavirus similar to SARS”.
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Venjlan, were warned by the police of responsibility for proliferation of false rumours, and the doctor, IFEN, received a statement from its chiefs for panicing.
Later, 31 December, the Uhahna Municipal Health Commission published a public notification and informed WHO of the situation.
The Uhanja health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which proved to be sufficient to initiate an investigation in early January. In early stages, the number of cases was doubled every seven and a half days.
At the beginning and mid-January 2020, the virus was also spread in other Chinese provinces, which contributed to the new Chinese celebration and the fact that Uhan was a transport and main railway node.
On 20 January, China reported about 140 new infections in one day, including two people in Beijing, and one in Shanchen.
More officially, by 20 January 2020, the symptoms of disease have already occurred in 6 174 people. As at 26 March, the United States have enslaved China and Italy at the largest number of infections in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million infections have been registered throughout the world, more than 97,000 have died and more than 364,000 have been recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one registered infection case.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries of the Schengen Zone have limited the free movement and have established border control.
National response measures included measures to prevent the dissemination of diseases, such as quarantine (known as the obligation to stay at home, mandatory hiding of the house or isolation), as well as a commanding hour. As at April 2, 300 million people, or some 90 per cent of the United States population, were in some form of quarantine, more than 50 million people are in the isolation of the Philippines, some 59 million are in South Africa and 1,3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in a form of isolation, and two days later, the number increased to 2.6 billion — about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Uhaan on 1 December 2019; according to the second report, the validity of the information was not verified, the date was 17 November.
On 26 December, a doctor of Jean Cisian worked with an unknown type of pneumonia, as informed by the Centre for Control and Prevention of Cianhani's Disease in the city of Uhan.
The initial genetic testing of patients on 27 December 2019 showed the existence of a SARS-like coronavir.
On 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of the Eagle issued the relevant public notification.
WHO was notified the same day.
In connection with such notifications, the police warned the doctors in Uhaan of responsibility for the “proliferation of rumors” of the flash.
The Chinese National Health Commission originally claimed that there was no " manifest proof" of the ability of the re-detected virus to be transmitted from human to human.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to prevent the spread of the virus, which was later referred to as the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China Si Zingpine as “national war”.

For example, a 14-day mandatory quarantine was introduced in Beijing for all international travellers coming to the city. As at 23 March, only one transmission of infection from the country, which took place five days earlier, was registered from a person returning to Guanzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Prime Minister of China, Li Kecan, reported that the dissemination of diseases transmitted inside the country was mainly suspended, and the flash was under control in China.
On the same day, the restrictions on visits to Hubay, other than Uhan, were removed two months after the quarantine province was closed. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that the entry for persons with visa or residential species would be suspended.

On 5 February, WHO requested the world community to allocate $675 million to ensure strategic readiness to epidemic in low-income countries, informing the need to provide immediate assistance to those countries who “no systems for the detection of people infected by the virus, despite that the epidemic has not yet reached these countries”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the indicator of our readiness was a degree of readiness to the epidemic of our weakest bond” and called on the international community to“to make a choice: to invest today or to pay in the future”. At the press conference held on 11 February, the WHO established the official name of COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antoniu Guterish, agreed to provide the “potential of the entire UN system in response to the problem”.
As a result, the UN Panel for Crisis Management has been established to coordinate all response measures of the United Nations; these steps, as WHO states, will allow “to focus on health responses, while other agencies can use their experience to combat the explosion of disease in a broader social and economic manner”.
On 14 February, WHO and China were initiated by a joint special group, which provided the work of international experts and WHO staff in the field in China to assist in addressing the situation in the country and the assessment of “serious disease and infections”, organized seminars and meetings with the leading national institutions, as well as field exits to assess “efficiency of response measures at the provinces and districts, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, WHO stated that “the world should do more to prepare for the possible pandemy of coronavir, noting that “but too early to call this pandemic disease but countries, however, should be ready to do so”.
On 28 February the WHO officials stated that the probability of global proliferation of the coronavir would be increased from the " high" to the highest level of readiness and risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Emergency Health Programme, warned in his statement: “It is a test of every Government on the planet at the readyness of the real situation: it is time to act.
This virus may be already on its way to your country, and you must be ready," and stressed that correct response measures could help the world to avoid the “worst scenario of development”.
Ryan also stated that the current data were not the basis for the announcement of the global pandemic as officials of the public health sector, and added that the announcement of the pandemic would mean that “we would essentially recognize the fact that everyone on the planet would be risked to be infected by this virus”.
On 11 March, WHO announced the explosion of the coronavirus of pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO stated that WHO was “deeply concerned about both the high level of dissemination and seriousness of disease and the concernless level of unevenness in this issue.” WHO is seriously criticized by the inadequate approach to the concept of pandemia, including later public health and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
Mr. Tedros Adanoma, as a response to the situation addressed to the Director-General of WHO, petition was made with a proposal to resign, signed by 733,000 persons as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of human rights experts emphasized the importance of respect for every human rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone had the right to apply to life-saving measures and that the Government was responsible for the organization of such measures.
The Panel emphasized that the lack of resources or health insurance should not at all be an excuse for discrimination against a specific group of people.
Experts emphasized that every person has the right to health, including people with limited opportunities, representatives of minorities, elderly citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless, citizens living in extremely bad conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other uncertain groups needing public support.
International governmental organizations consider the economic and social implications of the COVID-19 crisis.
The organization of economic cooperation and development established a platform designed to provide timely and comprehensive information on response policy measures throughout the world, as well as to awareness of views and recommendations.
The digital node contains information on the political measures of various countries (Country Policy Tracker) on strengthening health and global economy, eliminating the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and facilitate coordinated global response measures to combat coronavir.
The Government of China was criticized by the United States, the Minister of the UK Cabinet of Michael Hawa and Eduardo Bolsonaru, the son of President of Brazil, Jaire Bolsonaro, for action to combat the pandemia that began with the Chinese province of Hubai.
Several of the leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) of the provincial level were fired for the quarantine measures they had taken in the central part of China, and these disadvantaged acts of political explosion in those regions have demonstrated dissatisfaction.
Some commentators believe that this step aimed at protecting the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China Si Zingpina from public anger on the explosion of the coronavir.
Some Chinese officials, such as Jao Litzjan, expressed disagreement with the previous statement that the explosion of the coronavir began in Uhan, but took a side of the theory of conspiracy that COVID-19 had occurred in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. Administration of the President, Donald Tramp, called the coronavir of the Chinese virus or the Uhan virus, saying that “censorship in China is only achieving the situation with a virus that has now become a global pandemic”, and this statement was in turn criticized by some commentors who claimed that such approach is racist and“ distracts from the failure of the U.S. Administration to prevent the dissemination of disease”.
The Daily Beast had access to the Government telegram of the United States, which contained the communications strategic trick that appears to be designed by the National Security Council, and there were the following mentions of the strategy: “All in China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any way, including press conferences and television statements.” Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg stated that China ' s efforts to assist countries suffering from viruses are part of the “propagandist effort” to gain global impact.
The Head of the EU External Political Department, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of a “geopolitical component that includes the fight for influence through the pirace and so-called generosity policy”.
Borrell also stated that “China has insisted on its role in a responsible and reliable partner, in contrast with the United States”.
China also called upon the United States to cancel sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while, according to some information, sending assistance to the last two countries.
The offering by Jack Ma 100 000 medical masks to Cuba has been prohibited in connection with US sanctions on 3 April.
The United States authorities are also accused of redirecting assistance for other countries to their own country.
Medical masks have also raised disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has allocated hundreds of IBL devices for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of support by the European Union for the coronavirus of Italy.
Mauricio Masari, Italian Ambassador to the EU, said that “China only responded bilaterally.
This definitely does not indicate European solidarity."
On 22 March, after the telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Italy, Judeppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin organized a sending to Italy of Russian military sanitators, specialized disinfective transport and other medical equipment.
The Italian La Stampa quotes an anonymous “political source of high-level” claiming that 80 per cent of Russian assistance was“ useless or unnecessary for Italy.”
The source accused Russia of seeking a favourable impression on the global public at “geopolitical and diplomatic” level.
President of Lombardia Attilio Fontana and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy Luigi Di Mayo rejected the media attacks and expressed their gratitude for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft to the United States with medical assistance.
The Press Secretary of Kremlin Dmitri Peskov said that “in proposing assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] suggests that when the American medical equipment and material producers increase in production, they will also be able to provide responsibilities if necessary”.
NATO ' s Military Doctrines, 2020, planned in Germany, Poland and Baltic countries, will be held in short format after the end of the cold war.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, has criticized the teachings of Defender 2020 (Defender-2020) " , " In the crisis situation today in public health, the conduct of these teachings threatens the lives of not only US military and many European countries, but also the inhabitants of countries where such activities should be conducted " . The Government of Iran has suffered a severe impact on the virus. It is infected by about two dozen members of Parliament and 15 other current or former political actors.
On 14 March 2020, the President of Iran Hasan Ruhani, in an open letter, requested the world leaders to assist, noting that his country was failing to combat the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets in connection with sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran. The epidemic called upon the United States to adopt social policies circulated in other existing countries, including the introduction of a single health system and care for children paid for family leaves and the increase in public health financing.
Politicians expected that this could have a negative impact on the chances of Donald Tramp to re-elect in the presidential elections of 2020, which has resulted in a deterioration of diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea has criticized Japan ' s " indifferent and passive quarantine measures" after the announcement of Japan that any civilian arriving from South Korea will be placed on a two-week quarantine in the special places of the Government.
The South Korean society was initially divided because of the response of President Moon Jee-in to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either approve of the President ' s actions or called for Mr. Moone's impeachment for inadequate, in their view, the response of the Government to the illness.
Some commentators are concerned that this step will allow Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted in favour of granting the Prime Minister Victor Orban an immediate right to manage by orders, suspend the work of Parliament, and conduct elections and punish those who will be accused of the spread of viral information on the virus and Government action against the crisis.
The explosion of the coronavirus was described as a cause of several cases of deficit of supplies in connection with the global increase in the use of equipment to combat epidemic, a bunch of goods in panic and the disturbance of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Administration for Monitoring the Quality of Food and Medicines has issued warnings about the lack of medicines and medical equipment, which resulted in increased consumer demand and suppliers' disturbances.
In several settlements there were also panic shoppings; this led to the situation where the first need for food, toilet paper and bottled water had disappeared from the shelves of shops, which, in turn, led to a deficiency of stocks.
In particular, the technological industry warns of delays in electronic goods supplies.
According to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, the demand for individual protection has increased 100 times.
This jump led to a twentieth increase in prices compared to the usual price, as well as to delays in the supplies of medical appointment for four to six months.
He also caused a lack of individual protection throughout the world, and WHO warned that for that reason health workers would be under attack.
In Australia, daigou customers had a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China as a result of the pandemic.
This has resulted in a lack of child food in some supermarkets and has been subsequently prohibited by the Government of Australia, despite the high proliferation of COVID-19 in Northern Italy and the Uhan region, as well as the high demand for foodstuffs, in both areas, the acute lack of food has been avoided.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation of stocks and illicit trade by critically important products that have been successful have prevented the sharp lack of food that was expected in Europe and in North America.
Northern Italy, which has small agricultural production, has not experienced significant declines, but, according to the representatives of the industry, prices for agricultural production may increase.
Food stores were empty only temporaryly, even in the city of Uhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pig stocks in order to ensure full nutrition.
Similar laws that require food products to preserve food for emergency circumstances exist in Italy.
The damage caused by the world economy has been affected in China: according to the media of 16 March, China's economy has suffered significantly in the first two months of 2020 due to the anti-proliferation of the virus adopted by the Government, which resulted in reduced by 20.5 per cent.
The Material China is a large economic and production centre; therefore the virus flash is a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
According to Agate Demaraj, Economist Intelligence Unit, volunteering on the markets will remain until the potential results are more clear.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic in global growth could be overcome the consequences of the epidemic of atipical pneumonia 2002-2004.
One of the estimates made by the expert from the Washington University in St. Louis, the world supply chain could be more than $300 billion, and the negative impact could last up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Oil Exporters (OPEC) has taken “instant measures” after a sharp reduction in oil prices due to the decline in demand by China.
On 24 February, the world fund markets had fallen due to a significant increase in the number of people infected by COVID-19 outside the country.
On 27 February, various United States Fund Indexs, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and Dou-Johns index for industrial companies, showed the most rapid fall since 2008, and the Dou index fell by 1191 items, the biggest one-day decline after the financial crisis of 2007-2008.
At the end of the week, all three indexes showed more than 10 per cent decline.
On 28 February, the Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative forecast.
Actions have fallen again due to concerns about the proliferation of the coronavir, and the biggest decline occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that economic recession is likely.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian gave high assessment of timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks respond faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in connection with the bans on movement, the closure of public places, including tourist qualities, and the recommendations of Governments to take no travel.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines cancelled flights due to a rapid reduction in demand for aircraft, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British Regional Aviation Company Flybe stopped existence.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry has been as strong as ever.
Several railway stations and shipping ports were also closed.
The epidemic compared with Chung-June, the main tourist season of Chinese new-day celebration.
The national and regional Governments had abolished a number of activities with a large number of people, including annual new festivals; private companies also closed their shops and tourist remarks, such as the Hong Kong and the Shanghai Disneylands.
Many new events have been cancelled, and tourist qualities have been closed to prevent the mass of people; for example, in Beijing, the Prohibition City was closed and traditional temple shops were cancelled.
In 24 of 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended new holidays until 10 February, giving the instruction to most companies not to open until that date.
These regions were 80 per cent of the GDP of the country and 90 per cent of exports.
The Hong Kong authorities raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest and announced an emergency situation by closing schools before March and canceling the New Year's celebration. The trade sector has suffered globally: the store hours have been reduced and some shops have been temporaryly closed.
The visit to discount trade points in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40 per cent.
Retail trade companies in North America and the Middle East reduced sales by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, 33 to 43 per cent of the visit to trade centres in March fell compared to February.
Trade centres throughout the world have introduced additional measures, such as the improvement of sanitation conditions, the installation of equipment for checking visitors' temperature and cancelling activities. According to the assessment of the United Nations Economic Commission on Latin America, the Latin American recession caused by pandemic may leave the limit of poverty to 14 to 22 million people more than would have been in a similar situation but without pandemic.
In January and February 2020, in the middle of the epidemic in Uhan, about 5 million people lost their job in China.
Many of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers were homes in their country provinces or locked in the Hubai province, and in March 2020 more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and called for assistance to the Government.
According to Saint Louis's Federal Reserve Bank, the explosion of the coronavir in the United States could deprive the workplace of 47 million people, while the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent. The measures imposed in India would leave dozens of millions of Indian migrant workers receiving daily salary. The study conducted by the Angus Reid Institute showed that 44 per cent of Canadian households had thus encountered unemployment. Almost 900 000 Spanish workers have also lost jobs since the strict isolation in Spain in the middle of March 2020.
During the second half of March 4 million French workers made statements for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers requested a single social payment. Almost half a million companies in Germany have transferred their staff to the Government's subsidised short working schedule, a part-time working day.
The German labour wage scheme was also introduced in France and Britain.
The spheres of art and cultural heritage have also been severely affected by a pandemic that affected the activities of organizations, as well as individuals, whether officially established or independent, throughout the world.
Cultural and art organizations have tried to support their (publically financed State) cultural heritage mission, ensuring the safety of their staff and the public, as possible by supporting art people.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions were closed throughout the world for an uncertain period, or access to them was differently limited, and exhibitions, activities and presentations were cancelled or transferred to other dates.
In exchange, active efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accumulation resulting from the proliferation of the virus — the cancellation of religious services, major sports activities and other public activities such as musical festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Pastic Week in Rome, which was held last week of the Christian Repentant period, the Great Post.
Many Ephrases recommend that elderly Christians stay at home and do not attend Sundays; in some churches, church services have started broadcasting on radio, directly or television, while some church leaders are proposing to conduct worships in open air.
The Roman Catholic Ephry of Rome closed to visiting its churches, clocks and places of St. Peter, where Christian pilgrimages have not yet appeared, and other religious organizations later also canceled worship and limited access to public worships in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and guuders.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the abolition of Friday prayers in areas affected by the explosion of the coronavir and the holidays were later closed; Saudi Arabia prohibited access to foreign pilgrimages and its own residents to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
The Pandemia has led to the most significant changes in the global sports events since World War II.
Most major sports activities were cancelled or transferred, including the League of UEFA champions 2019-20, Prime Minister of League 2019-20, Euro-2020 UEFA, NBA season 2019-20 and NHL season 2019-20.
The explosion of the coronavirus also destroyed the plans for the summer Olympic Games of 2020 to begin at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be " transferred for the period after 2020 but not later than the summer of 2021 " . Casino and other games throughout the world were closed, and the poker tournaments that were usually transmitted directly were either transferred or cancelled.
This resulted in the fact that many players were online and many gambling sites reported a significant increase in the number of new subscribers. The entertainment industry also suffered because various musical groups suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as the Broadways, have also cancelled all their spectacles.
As an alternative to traditional offline activities, some artists and musicians began to study options for continuing their activities and sharing their results on the Internet, organizing direct online concerts or web festivals; this helps people of creative professions to continue to perform, release or publish their works.
There have been many Internet moths on the subject of the coronavirus, many of which are humorous and collaborate alarming moods characterized for uncertainty periods.
Since COVID-19 had been observed the aggravation of prejudice, xenophobia and racism against Chinese citizens and people of eastern Asian origin, as well as to the population of hot points of Europe, the United States and other countries.
There were cases of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
In the information summary on February (when most infections were still limited to China) racist moods expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who seem to have deserved this virus or have received fair retribution for anything.
In some countries, anti-Chinese moods are also increasing.
Many inhanja and Hubaya have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Citizens of China, as well as those who live in viral areas, were supported both in offline and online mode.
The epidemic began to spread in new countries, in particular in Italy, the first in Europe, which faced a serious explosion of COVID-19; the citizens of such regions may also be affected by suspiciousness and xenophobia. Citizens such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea in early stage signed a petition, insisting on prohibiting the entry of China to their countries to prevent epidemic.
In Japan, heshtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan (#Chinese Do not arrive in Japan) took leading positions in Twitter.
Citizens of China, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, report on the growing level of racism and even attacks.
The President of the United States, Donald Tramp, faced criticism for what he called the coronavirus “Chinese virus”; the criticism considers this view as racist and anti-China.
In Ukraine, protestants attacked buses transported to New Sangaras of Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Uchan.
Students arriving from border with China in north-eastern India and trained in large cities of India reported persecutions related to the explosion of coronavir.
Dilip Ghosh, President of the State Division of the Party of Bharatia Janata, West Bengalia, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and “God has revenged them.”
Later, these statements were convicted by the Chinese Consultation in Calcutta, which was called “laughter”. In China, xenophobia and racism were re-exploded against non-Chinese citizens: aliens began to be called “foreign trash” and objects to “utilization”.
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all areas affected by the coronavir.
Many scientific publishers presented their scientific articles on the explosion of the coronavir.
Some scientists have decided to provide short-term access to the results of their studies in the press publication servers, such as bioRxiv.
Infectious infectious disease — infectious disease of the returning pathogen, the dissemination range or the method of transmission of which is often unknown
Globalization and disease — Review of globalization and dissemination
List of epidemic and pandemic — List of infectious diseases
The smuggling of wild animals and diseases transmitted from a human person are the health risks associated with the trade of exotic animals.
The laboratory testing of the respiratory coronavir 2019 (CIVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 includes the methods of identifying the presence of the virus and the methods of detection of antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the OTC, which recognizes the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and intended only to identify SARS-COV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm sufficiently recent or active infections.
The detection of anti-thels (serology) can be used both for diagnostic and for population control.
Antibody analysis indicates the number of people suffering from diseases, including those whose symptoms were too small to be treated or not.
The precise mortality rate of this disease and collective immunity can be determined according to the results of this test.
As at March 2020, there were no reliable data on the proliferation of the virus in any country due to limited testing opportunities.
By 23 March, no country has been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and the number of tests carried out in different countries is very contrary.
Such differences may have significantly affected the recorded mortality rates that may be significantly overcome in some countries.
With a polymerous chain reaction of the reverse transcryption in real time (RRT-PCR) the test can be conducted on samples from respiratory paths obtained by different ways, including a swallowed or wet.
The results are usually available within a period of hours to two days.
The O-PCR test carried out on the throats only during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, continuing, however, to multiply into the lungs.
Infected patients tested on the second week of the disease may be taken as alternative from the lower respiratory paths by sustaining cateter, or wet products may be used.
One of the early PCR tests was developed in the Chariti Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020, using a polymerate chain reverse transcryption in real time (RRT-PCR) and a lie based on 250,000 sets that was subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom has also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean Cogenebiotech developed a set to detect SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of the clinical PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It detects a gen “E”, common for all beta coronovirs and RdRp gen specific to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese BGI Group has become one of the first companies that have authorized the National Management for Medicinal Products for the Urgent Use of SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of PCR. In the United States, the Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) distribute through the International Reagent Resources its diagnostic panel to conduct RT-PCR in real time (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests from the older versions of the test sets was incomplete because of unrelated reactents and the narrow CDC testing area in Atlanta; the average processed less than 100 samples per day during February 2020.
Two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that date, the public and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Office for Food and Medicines ' Quality Oversight as an emergency permit. The U.S. Trade Laboratories started a test early in March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing the infection of COVID-19 on the basis of RT-PCR throughout the country.
Quest Diagnostics began the COVID-19 testing throughout the country since 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limits have been made; the fence and analysis should be carried out in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Centre for Virusology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Oversight Service. It was reported that on 12 March 2020 the Mayo Clinic has developed a test to identify COVID-19 infections. On 13 March 2020 Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA for a test that could be conducted for 3,5 hours at a large level of tests, allowing one machine to process approximately 4128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorisation to Abbott (EUA) laboratories for Abbott m2000 testing; the FDA had previously issued a similar authorisation by Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also receives EUA from FDA for a long-term test of approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has also approved a test in which the PCCs use the technologies for implication of isothermic nuclein acids instead.
Since the test does not require a series of series of temperatures, this method can detect positive results in only five minutes and negative in 13 minutes.
There is now about 18,000 such vehicles in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a monochlonic antibody test is currently processed, which is specifically linked to the Nucleocopsidal protein (N-Belk) of the new coronavir, and hopes to obtain results in 15 to 20 minutes, like a flu-expression test.
The review of the specialized literature for March 2020 concludes that “renthgenograms of breast cells have a small diagnostic value in early stages, while the results of the CTC [computer] may have such value even before symptoms appear.”
The typical signs shown in the CTC include bilateral multi-dollar sub-plaural focuses on the type of " math glass" with peripheral, asymmetrical and "terrior distribution.
Subplaural domination, the symptom of the bridge and consolidation are developing as the disease is progressed.
The studies comparing the PCP and CTC methods used in Uhaan during the current pandemic have shown that the CT is much more sensitive than the PRC, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions are in conformity with other pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College has issued a recommendation “do not use CT as a first line testing method in COVID-19”. As of March 2020, it recommends the use of the PCR method.
Partially the immune response to the infection is expressed in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to identify human infection after the 7th day of the symptoms, to identify immunity and to conduct population control. Analysis can be conducted in central laboratories (CLT) or by diagnosticing in the place (PCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these analysis will be able to perform high-productive automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each such system.
CLT usually uses one sample of peripheral blood, although serial samples can be used to track the immune response.
In the POCT, one blood sample is usually given through each shelter.
In contrast to the PCR methods, the blood fence phase is not required to take a sparkling analysis. On 26 March 2020, the FDA referred to 29 organizations that have passed all the necessary registration procedures and can now distribute their antibodies tests.
As at 7 April 2020, FDA approved only one test on an emergency authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European permissions to use their test sets that can be identified in the antibody blood samples of IgG and IgA with the ability to combat the virus.
The production of the test is several hundred samples for several hours and, therefore, this method works much faster than the normal PCR viral RNA analysis.
At the beginning of April, Britain discovered that none of the antibody acquired acquisition sets for antibodies can be detected in 14 days after infection.
In Hong Kong, there was a scheme that allows patients with suspicion of the virus to remain at home: “Official Officers transmit the sample sample to the patient”, the patient swims back to it, returns and after some time receives the results of the test. The British NHS announced the launch of its pilot scheme of suspicious cases in domestic conditions that eliminate the risk of infection by other visitors of the clinic, or the need to disinfect the ambulance car if it was used for the transport of the patient. During the COVID-19 expression test in suspicious cases, the medical worker takes an analysis using all appropriate precautions.
The Centre for Expression Centres helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and largest testing procedures than any other country. On 2 March in Germany, the National Association of Medicines for Communist Insurance stated that it was ready to conduct about 12,000 tests per day in ambulatory conditions and only 10,700 tests a week earlier.
If the survey is designated as a doctor, the costs are covered by medical insurance.
According to the President of the Institute of Robert Koh, the total productivity of Germany in the testing plan is 160,000 tests per week.
As at 19 March, the expression test was proposed in several major cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of German tests was unknown because only positive results were registered.
The first laboratory study showed that, as for the calendar week 12/2020, the Israeli Technion and Rambam Hospital Clinic had developed and tested a simultaneous testing of samples taken by 64 patients, combined by the samples and further analysis only if the combined sample showed a positive result. In Uganha on 5 February 2020, the BGI was opened by a temporary laboratory at the area of 2000 square metres to find extraordinary cases called Huo-Jang (Chinese or Fire Eye), which could process more than 10 000 per day.
The lab was organized by the founder of BGI Van Zyan and completed in only five days; the modeling showed that if this laboratory had not been initiated in such a speedy rate, the disease in Hubea would have been 47 per cent higher, and accordingly, the quarantine costs would also be twice above.
At the opening of the Uhan Lab, the Huo Jan laboratories in Shanggen, Tenzzine, Peking and Shanghai were immediately opened in 12 towns of China.
By 4 March 2020, a total of 50,000 tests per day were released by 4 March 2020, and the open multiplex schemes of Origami Assays were released, which could test up to 1,122 patients' analysis on COVID19 using only 93 samples. Such balanced structures could work in small labs, except the need for use of robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, because of the lack and insufficient number of respondents, the mass testing in the EU, Britain and the United States has become difficult.
As a result, some authors have requested test sample processing protocols which provide for the heating of samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genome for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the amount of testing for coronavir being conducted by the United Arab Emirates on the soul of the population was above the indicators of any other country and that the majority of the population would soon be tested.
This was due to the possibilities of the expression testing, including the acquisition of a mass testing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (created on the basis of their Emergency Laboratories in China).
This laboratory, deployed in 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first in the world's laboratory of so large scale working outside China.
Various testing options for various parts of the genetic coronavir profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted a German version of the manufacture of test sets that are sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop their own sets.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States sanitation and epidemiological centres was not available until 28 January, which led to the lack of test sets in the United States.
In South Korea, according to experts, the broad availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavir.
During several years, the Government of South Korea has worked on providing opportunities for testing, mainly, in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for increasing the development of testing programmes as the best way to slow down the COVID-19 dissemination of the pandemic. As a result of an increase in the demand for testing due to the rapid proliferation of the virus, many U.S. private laboratories with hundreds of thousands of samples of analysis have been overloaded, and the stocks of materials for the clothing and chemical reactors were rapidly exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test sets.
The American testing sets developed by CDC had “deficiencies”, and for that reason the Government removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented the private development of tests. Spain acquired test sets from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the use of these sets was incorrect.
The company explained that the result was incorrect or the wrong use of the samples.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would withdraw the incorrect results sets and replace them with other sets — Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80 per cent of the test sets that Czech Republic acquired in China were incorrect. 1,2 million test sets acquired by Slovakia in China were also considered inaccurate.
The Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they will be discarded in Dunay. Ates Kara, a staff member of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, argued that the test sets acquired in China had “a high level of errors” and the Ministry had “no use”. Britain purchased 3.5 million test sets in China, but at the beginning of April 2020 was declared that these sets were unfit.
Quarantine measures for persons whose analysis have resulted positively in SARS-CoV-2, as well as monitoring of people with whom such patients were contacted, had positive results.
Students working in the Italian city of V, where the first time in Italy a person died from COVID-19, conducted two testing cycles of around 3400 people, with about ten days of interval.
Some half people had no symptoms with positive results, and all patients with quarantine confirmed cases were placed on quarantine.
The entry into the territories of the population was closed, and this measure has completely prevented the spread of infection.
In the context of the intensive monitoring of contacts, input limits, testing and quarantine measures of the coronavir pandemic of 2020 in Singapore, there was much less tense than in other developed countries, and there were no need to be extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and shops.
Many events were cancelled there, and on 28 March, Singapore began to advise the inhabitants to stay at home, but schools at which the holidays ended on 23 March were opened according to the schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also dealt with the pandemic because of intense monitoring of contacts, entrance restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but limitations were less aggressive.
The statistics study showed that in countries where more tests were conducted compared to the number of deaths, mortality rates have been much lower, probably because more patients with lowly expressed symptoms or lack of symptoms have been identified.
WHO recommends that countries with no resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19 provide their first five positive and first ten negative results for COVID-19 in one of the 16 WHO control laboratories for confirming the testing.
7 of these 16 control laboratories are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The following chart depends on the test policies adopted in the country.
The country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have higher positive results in percentages compared to the country where all citizens are tested, regardless of the symptoms of the virus, under other equal conditions.
The washing of hands also known as “hygiene of hands” is a process of cleaning hands to remove pollution, fat, micro-organisms or other harmful substances.
Regular washing of hands in certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted in a fecal-ormal way.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or normal cold, for example if he touches his eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. slippery shells) with uneven hands.
Five critical moments during the day after which the hands should be washed with sauce: before and after defecation, after the washing of the baby’s beans or the change of pearls, before feeding the child, before food, and before and after the preparation of raw meat, fish and domestic birds.
If the water and sauce are not available, the hands can be cleaned by the poultry. The World Health Organization recommends the washing of your hands:
Do, during and after the preparation of food.
Before and after the treatment of a sick person.
After changing pearls or washing the child going to the toilet.
After the rings, coughing or sneaking.
After touching animals, feed or waste of animal origin.
The medical hygiene of the hands relates to the hygiene of medical procedures.
Laundering hands before taking medicinal products or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the dissemination of disease.
The main medical goal of the washing of hands is to clean the hands of patogens (bacteria, viruses or other micro-organisms capable of illness), as well as chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who are preparing or working in medical fields, but it is also important to all other people.
The laundering of hands is very useful for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of flu, coronavir and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious diarrheas, reduces respiratory infections,
and also reduces infant mortality at home.
The 2013 study showed that more quality laundering of hands could result in a small increase in child growth under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhea diseases may be reduced by acquiring simple habits such as washing hands with sauce.
This elementary procedure is capable of reducing mortality from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular reminders on the benefit of the laundering of hands may reduce the number of diarrhoea cases by about a third, compared to the low-income regions with pure water.
The reduction of the number of diarrhoeas by 48 per cent may be linked to washing hands with sauce. Washing hands with sauce is the only most effective and unexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and sharp respiratory diseases (OPC) under the conditions of developing appropriate habits in each house, in schools and other public places worldwide.
The pneumonia, one of the main complications of ORI, is the main cause of death among children under five years of age, which lives about 1.8 million children per year.
Almost 3.5 million children die from diarrhoea and pneumonia a whole year.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund reports that washing hands with sauce before food and after the toilet became a solid habit may save more lives than any separate vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce the mortality of the diarrhoea almost twice and the mortality of sharp respiratory infections by a quarter.
The washing of the hands is usually combined with other sanitation activities under water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
The laundering of hands also prevents the rise of the impetigo, which is transmitted in direct physical contact.
A small negative effect of frequent laundering of hands is that it may lead to skin drying and, therefore, to damage.
The 2012 Danish study showed that too frequent laundering of hands could lead to a disease known as an exemption or dermatitis of hands, which is particularly common to health workers.
The too frequent laundering of hands may also be considered one of the symptoms of obsessive and compulsive disorders (ODA).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when washing hands with sauce is important to reduce the risk of fecal oral transmission of the disease: after the discharge (pouring, defecation), after the washing of the baby’s belly (cleaning), before feeding the child, and/before the preparation of food or processing of raw meat, fish or birds.
Some other cases where hands should be washed with a view to preventing the transmission of the disease: before or after the processing of a cut or wound, after sneaking, coughing or drowning, after touching animal waste or animal waste, after touching the trash.
In many countries, the washing of hands with sauce has been very little.
Study on the washing of hands in the 54 countries in 2015 showed that the average of 38.7 per cent of the sauce washing families was generally accepted. The 2014 study showed that 97 per cent was found in Saudi Arabia; the United States in this list was closer to the middle; their 77 per cent was the lowest rate in China was 23 per cent. There are currently several methodologies of changing and developing the habit of washing hands in critical situations.
“The programme of urgent medical assistance”, implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is an example of widespread activities to strengthen child health and to improve the education of children.
The national programme is based on degelmintization, which is conducted twice a year, as well as daily washing of hands with sauce and daily teeth cleaning.
The same programme is successful in Indonesia.
The removal of micro-organisms from each shelter is more effective if the washing process is added to sauce or washing.
The main action of sauce and washing is to eliminate barriers for solution and to improve its level.
Water itself is not considered an effective means for skin cleaning, since fats and proteins that are components of organic pollution are badly dissolved in the water.
The sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the cleaning process.
The hard sauce, due to repeated use, may also contain bacteria that may affect it in previous use.
A small number of studies devoted to the impact of each bacteria from a contaminated piece of solid powder indicates that the probability of this occurrence is low because the bacteria are washed with pen.
The CDC still claims that “the liquid sauce with the hand-doser is a preferred option for washing hands”.
The antibacterial sauce is actively advertising in health care communities.
Today, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfecting means has a selective impact on organisms that have sustainability to antibiotics by nature.
However, the antibacterial sauce contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosane, to which many resistant species of organism are sustained.
Thus, even if the antibiotics are not selective to antibacterial sauce, their efficiency may not correspond to the advertising.
In addition to the surface-active substance and the means to protect the skin, complex connections may contain acids (axus, ascorbine, breast) as an RN regulator, as well as an antimicrobial active gas acid and other supplies (aloe, vitamins, mentol, plant extracts). The comprehensive analysis conducted by the School of Public Health of the University of Oregon showed that in the prevention of diseases and removal of bacteria from the skin of the hands, the simple varieties of sauce are as effective as the usual antibacterial sauce containing triclosan.
Hot water comfortable for human skin temperature is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria are multiplying much faster at the body temperature of 37 °C.
However, the warm washing water is more effective to remove natural fats that contain pollution and bacteria.
In contrast to the common opinion, research has shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbe load on hand.
The disinfecting tool for the hands (sanitation) or the antiseptic for hand is a tool for the hygiene of no water.
At the end of the 1990s, and early the 21st century, there was a popularity for the hygiene of arms on an alcoholic basis (also known as disinfective means for alcoholic hands, antiseptical means for disinfecting hands or sanitationers).
Most of these funds are produced on the basis of isopropyl spirt or ethanol with a addiction of densers such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a hel, or moisture, such as glycerine in liquid or pen, which provides the comfort of the use of these means and reducing the drying effect of the skin with alcohol.
The additive of the diluted hydrogen oxygen further increases antimicrobic activity. Dezinfeking agents containing minimum 60 to 95 per cent of the spirt have effectively destroyed microbes.
Disinficient agents kill bacteria, including multiple medicine sustainability (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis stick, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rinovirus, vaccine, flu and hepatitis) and mushrooms.
Disinficient agents containing 70 per cent of spirt kill 99.97 per cent of bacteria (label reduction of 3.5 by 35 decibels) in hand 30 seconds after the use and 99.99 per cent - 99.999 per cent of bacteria (label 4-5) on hand in one minute after use. Disinficient tools for hand are most effective against bacteria and are less effective against certain viruses.
The disinfective agents on the alcohol basis are practically ineffective against viruses of the type (or Norwalk), the most frequent cause of infectious gastroenterite. It is necessary to use enough antiseptic or spirt-containing means to carefully process and feed the skin of hands on both sides.
The face and rear surface of both arms, as well as the area between the fingers all over the length, shall be wiped for about 30 seconds until the liquid, pen or gel is fully used.
The U.S. Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases also should be carefully washed by fingers on both hands. The U.S. Centre recommends to choose for the washing of hands rather than for use of disinfective means, especially if the hands are severely polluted.
The increase in the popularity of such disinfective means is due to the simpleness of their use and rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not be replaced by the full-time washing of hands if there is a possibility to use water and sauce.
The frequent use of disinfecting hands on the alcoholic basis may cause the dryness of the skin if it does not contain mitigation and (or) skin moisture.
The drying effect of the skin can be reduced or removed by adding glycerine and (or) other mitigating substances into the funds.
In clinical trials, disinfecting alcoholic hands containing mitigating components caused significantly less irritation and dryness of skin than sauce or antimicrobial washing.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact compound syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfecting means are practically not arising.
The lower probability of an irritating contact dermatite has become a factor in selecting disinfectives compared to sauce and water.
Despite their efficiency, water-non-water means do not purify their hands from organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, disinfective means for hand are not so effective in preventing many pathogenic micro-organisms, such as ordinary soap and water, as pathogenic micro-organisms remain on their hands with such means.
The efficiency of the disinfecting tool for non-spirit hands is significantly dependent on components and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than spirt or spirt-containing.
It has recently been proven that the medicines in which the benzalconium chloride is used have a steady and cumulative antimicrobial activity, in contrast with spirt, which, as has been proven, has been lost effectiveness after repeated use, probably due to progressive side effects.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford sauce and replace it with gold or clay.
Zola or clay can be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than sauce.
One of the problems with this method is that, if clay or gold are polluted by micro-organisms, this may, on the contrary, increase the spread of disease.
Like sauce, the gold is a disinfecting tool, since the water is a gastrointestinal solution in contact with the water.
If the sauce is not available, the WHO as an alternative recommends use of wheat or sand.
In order to prevent infection, the United States Control Centre recommends that the laundering techniques include the following stages:
Put your hands under warm or cold flowing water.
It is recommended that flowing waters be contaminated, but the water temperature does not matter.
Wash your hands, washing them with a large amount of sauce, including the back side of your hands and the area between your fingers and the nails.
The powder removes microbes from the skin, and studies show that when we use sauce (not only one water) people are inclined to wash their hands more carefully.
Shake your hands at least 20 seconds.
Trening helps to remove the microbes from the skin, and the longer you shake your hands, the more microbes are removed.
Put your hands under the flowing water carefully.
Laying hands in a standing water may cause a reinfection.
Wash your hands with clean towels or let them dry alone.
Wet and wet hands are easier polluted, and most often people leave the areas such as the big finger, the wrist, the area between their fingers and their nails.
The artificial nails and the broken nucleus for nails can contain many micro-organisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisture loson to prevent the drying of the skin of the hands that may cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If the flowing water and sauce are not available, there are many different ways of washing hands: pouring water from a hanging canist or bottle tube with holes and (or) use of powder, for example in developing countries. In areas with limited water supplies (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries) there are conservative solutions such as tails with knife pedal and other unexpensive options.
The crane with a knife is a simple design of the ingredient of the rope, and a knife that should be pressed to make the water leak on the hands, and a piece of sauce should be used.
Effective handcuff is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but some disputes are being held on the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
The growing volume of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric drying for hands that are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the Westminster University in London was conducted by a study sponsored by the European Symposium for Paper Seals and Towels; the subject of this study was the comparison of the hygiene of paper towels, heat air dryers and more modern flood air dryers for hand.
It was established that after washing and drying of hands in warm air, the total number of bacteria on finger pillows increased by 194 per cent, while the hands were 254 per cent.
It was also clear that after the washing and drying of the hands in the air stream, the total number of bacteria on the finger pillows increased by 42 per cent and the hands by 15 per cent.
After the washing and drying of the hands, the total number of bacteria on finger pillows average decreases to 76 per cent and on their hands to 77 per cent. Scientists also performed tests to determine the possibility of cross-infection of several toilet rooms and the toilet environment at each type of dryer.
The air dryer that releases the air of 180 m/s declared speeds (650 km/h, 400 km/h) is capable of dissolving micro-organisms from the hands and from its own bloc and potentially infecting other toilet users and sanusles in a radius of up to 2 metres.
The use of heat air dryers spreads micro-organisms within a radius of up to 0.25 meters from drying.
There was no significant proliferation of micro-organisms in the use of paper towels. In 2005, T.V. Product und Umwelt conducted a study on the evaluation of various hand drying methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed depending on the drying method of the hand:
There are many different hand drying producers, and hand dryers compare to dry paper towels.
Cleaning the hands with disinfecting sulphurs may be an alternative solution during the journeys without sauce and water.
The disinfecting tool on the alcoholic basis shall contain at least 60 per cent of the spirt.
The medical method of washing hands has become mandatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignac Zemmelways discovered its high efficiency (in 1846) in prevention of diseases in stationary conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget.
According to one study, the use of such devices really helps to reduce the level of infection.
Medical washing of hands lasts at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of sauce, water or hel for washing and washing each part of the hands.
Hands should be thoroughly wiped on each other by scratching their fingers.
If there is dirt under the nails, the brush can be removed.
Since microbes can remain in the water present in their hands, it is important to wash them well and to wipe out the dryer with a clean glove.
After the drying of the hands, closing the crane and, if necessary, closing and opening any door, the paper towel should be used.
This allows to avoid reconciliation of hands from these surfaces.
The aim of washing hands in medical institutions is to remove pathogenic micro-organisms ("microbs") and prevent them from spreading.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the order of laundering of hands remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: many doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus spread micro-organisms.
According to one study, the correct laundering of hands and other elementary procedures may reduce the level of blood flow infections associated with the use of the cateter by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization published a package with a standard washing and hand processing tools that should be applied in the health sector.
The draft WHO ' s Hygiene Guide is also available on its website and open for public discussion.
The Whitby review was conducted in collaboration.
If regulatory requirements are required to be confirmed, commercial devices can be used to measure the indicators and hygiene of their hands.
The World Health Organization represents “five moments” when the hands should be washed:
after contact with blood or biological liquids,
Before the use of antiseptics and
After treatment of the patient. Adding antiseptic chemicals to sauce with hand washing (medicine or an antimicrobial) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgery or in the middle of a high content of antibiotic organisms. To clean the hands against surgery, cranes are required to be incorporated and deactivated without their hands; a little chlorgexidine or yodine water should also be used to lay hands off, sterile arms towels after washing, a sterile brush for the drying and another sterile cleaning tool.
All decorations must be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of hands and elbows for 2 to 6 minutes.
There's no need to waste your hands too long, for example, 10 minutes.
During the slap, the water from the front door should not fall back on the arms.
After completion of the washing, the hands dry with sterile tissue and wear surgery coat.
To reduce the proliferation of microbes, it is better to wash your hands or use the antiseptic for hand before and after the treatment of a sick person.
To combat staphylococ infections in hospitals, it was established that the first 20 per cent of the washing of hands was best benefited, and that very few additional advantages had been received when the laundering rate increased by more than 35 per cent.
In comparison with antibacterial sauce, the washing of hands with normal sauce has increased more than three times the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. The comparison of arm conversions with the spirt containing antibacterial soap and washing hands by a mid-30 seconds for each procedure indicated that the hand processing of the spirt-containing solution decreased bacterial pollution by 26 per cent compared to antibacterial sauce.
However, sauce and water are more effective than alcohol solutions for hand, in terms of reducing the number of flu virus A H1N1 and the dispute Clostridium difficiel. The activities for the development of the arms hygiene in medical institutions may include training of personnel with hand-laundering, increasing the availability of spirtural solutions for hand, as well as written and oral reminders to staff on the need to wash their hands.
Additional studies are required on the most effective types of action in various medical institutions.
In developing countries, the washing of hands with soap has been recognized as an economically effective and important means for improving health and even food.
However, the lack of stable water, sauce or means for washing hands in houses, schools and jobs makes the habit of regularly washing hands.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are far from each private or public toilets to wash hands, although there are cheap ways to organize washing hands in such places.
However, insufficient hygiene of hands can also be caused by rooted habits, not by lack of sauce or water.
Propaganda and the stimulation of washing hands can affect political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of washing hands and lead to long-term changes in population behavior.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, monitoring and evaluation should be carried out.
During a system-based 70 studies have been found that, in order to improve the hygiene-hand situation in countries below the average level, the health and epidemic surveillance at the community level is effective, while public marketing campaigns are less effective. One of the examples of propaganda for the washing of hands in schools is the approach of the United Nations Children ' s Fund for the United Nations " Three Star Approach " : it promotes the implementation of simple economic measures in schools that stimulate the washing of hands by students using sauce and the fulfilment of other hygienic requirements.
By ensuring compliance with minimum standards, schools can increase their level from one to three stars.
The establishment of handkeepers is one of the possible measures undertaken under the information campaigns on hand hygiene to reduce the level of illness and child mortality.
The Global Hand Washing Day Day Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour. As a result of the pandemic of the coronavir 2019-20 years, the United Nations Children's Fund promotes the use of emodzi symbolising the washing of hands.
Some studies considered the overall efficiency of washing hands in developing countries compared to the DALYs indicator (saved years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that the stimulation of washing hands with sauce is a much more economic solution than other sanitation measures.
The importance of washing hands for human health, especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two innovators in the field of hygiene of hands: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis), who worked in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale, English nurse and “the founder of modern care for patients”.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by rotten smells called miasms.
In the 1980s, in connection with the explosions of diseases spread through the food tract and infections related to health care, the United States Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases in the United States began more actively to promote the hygiene of hands as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the 2009 pig flu and COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, along with public toilet mannels, as well as office buildings and airports, there were posters with “proper hands-laundering techniques”.
The phrase "wailing hands" means showing its unwillingness to take responsibility for anything or to be a participant.
It comes from the Bible, Matthew’s Gospel: Pontius Pilate washed his hands in the decision of Jesus Christ’s singing; then the phrase became more extensive in some English communities.
In the Shakespeare Macbeth play, Lady McBett begins to wash her hands uncomfortablely in trying to clean up from the imaginary spot symbolising the unclean conscience of the crimes that she has committed and encouraged her husband.
It was also established that people who remembered or observed any non-ethical action are more likely to wash their hands compared to other people, and the handkeepers are more important to them.
Furthermore, it is less likely that people who have the opportunity to wash their hands after seeing will participate in any other “cleaning” compensatory activities, such as volunteer activities.
In religions, the washing of hands is both a higiene and symbolic purpose. Symbolic washing of hands with water, but without sauce, is part of the ritual envisaged in many religions, including bahaism, hinduism, tevilah, and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Woodhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe the hygienic washing of hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam prescribes mandatory washing of hands after the toilet visit.
In hinduism, Buddhism, Sykhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after each food.
Monitoring of production factors with regard to COVID-19
The control of production factors in relation to COVID-19 implies the use of labour and health safety methods to control the risk and combat the coronavirus of 2019 (CIVID-19).
Suitable risk control in the workplace depends on the place and jobs, based on the assessment of the risks, the seriousness of the epidemic in the community and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The United States Office for Labour Protection and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) reported that the posts with a lower risk have minimum vocational contacts with the public and colleagues, and in such cases basic measures are required to combat infections, including hand-laundering, incentives of workers to stay at home on illness, respiratory etiquette, and to conduct daily cleaning and disinfecting of the work environment.
The duties with the average risk require common or close contacts with people who have no confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis, but there is a probability of infection in relation to the ongoing dissemination of the disease in society or during international travel.
Such a category may include public contact workers, such as schools, high density workers and some large dining shops.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to the basic infectious prevention measures, include high-effective air filters, the use of protective screens and accessible personal protection for contact with the person infected by COVID-19.
OSHA believes that medical institutions and morgues who have contacted a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 are high-risk, while the risk is increased to very high in conducting such aerosol education procedures, or the collection/processing of human samples with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
The risk control measures suitable for such staff include the use of safety engineering, such as the ventilation rooms with negative pressure, as well as the means of personnel protection, suitable for the task.
The COVID-19 explosion may have a variety of effects in the workplace.
Employees may be lacked at work because of their own illness, the need for care for other persons or the fear of possible infections.
Commercial patterns may change both in respect of the types of goods that are demanded and how to acquire such goods (e.g. buying in non-peace periods with delivery or service without leaving the car).
Finally, possible contrasts with the delivery of goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19. The Protection Plan can be used for the provision of preparedness for epidemic and response measures.
Plans address risks related to various jobs and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors in houses and in communities, as well as risk factors of individual workers, such as age or availability of chronic diseases.
The plans also indicate the control measures necessary to address such risks as well as the emergency activities plans for situations that may result in the epidemic.
Plans to ensure the readiness of the epidemic and to carry out responses may be subjected to the recommendations of the national or state level.
Some of the goals to ensure response to the epidemic: reduction in the spread of the virus among staff, protection of people subjected to a higher risk of serious complications to health, maintenance of business operations and minimization of negative consequences for other organizations in their supply chains.
Responsible measures affect the severity of diseases in the community where business is.
The risk control hierarchy is a structure widely used in ensuring safety and labour hygiene to group such funds depending on efficiency.
Where the risk of COVID-19 is impossible to address the most effective safety engineering, then administrative measures and, eventually, personal protection.
Security engineering means the isolation of employees from job-related risks and do not rely on the behavior of the employee, which may be the most economically profitable solution.
Administrative measures provide for changes in working policies or procedures that require action from a worker or staff member.
Personal protection (PPE) is considered less effective compared to engineering or administrative measures, but may help to address some risks.
All types of personal protection should be selected depending on the threat to the worker, the size (e.g. respirators), to be used permanently and properly, to be regularly verified, to be maintained and replaced as appropriate, to be correctly removed, cleaned and stored or used to avoid the infection.
The United States Office for Labour and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) believes that the posts with the lowest risk have minimum contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all workplaces include frequent and careful laundering of hands, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, compliance with the respiratory label, including the closure of the mouth with coughing and sneaking, the provision of salts and containers for trash, readiness for remote or shift work, where necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, as well as the daily cleaning and disinfecting of the work environment.
Quick detection and isolation of persons who may be infected potentially is a critical step to protect workers, clients, visitors and other people in the workplace.
The United States Centres for Combating Disease and Prevention (CDC) recommends that staff with symptoms of sharp respiratory diseases remain at home before the heat stop, the lack of body temperature and many other symptoms within at least 24 hours without the use of homogenous or other medicines to address symptoms, and also prescribes flexibility of hospital leaves, allow staff to stay at home for care for a sick family member and to ensure that staff are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, the medium-level risk positions require common and close contacts at a distance of no more than six feet (1.8 m) to persons with no confirmed data or suspicion of COVID-19 infection, but there is a probability of SARS-COV-2 infection in relation to the proliferation of disease in the territory of business or in relation to recent travels of such a person to the COVID-19 dissemination.
Such categories include high-effective air filters, such as high density and some large dimension shops. Industrial security engineering for such groups and groups, with a higher risk, the installation of high-effective air filters, the improvement of the ventilation intensity, the installation of physical barriers, such as transparency plastic defensive screens, and the mounting of the windows for the customer service without leaving the car. Administrative measures for such groups and groups of higher risk include recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, replace personal meetings on communications with virtual means, setting modified schedules, stoping non-critical travels in the area of COVID-19, development of communication plans in emergency situations, including the responses of the sicken workers, initiating the initial, advocacy, advocacy, advocacy, and advocacy against others, advocacy, advocacy, and advocacy of the other workers, with the advocacy, with the advocacy, with the advocacy, with the advocacy, with the advocat, with the advokate, with the advokate to the other intervengun, with the advokate, with the advokate to the advokate, with the r to the r to the advokate, with the r to the r to the r to the r to the r to the r to the r to the r to the r to-go to-go to-go to-go to the r to the r to the r to the r to the r to the inter-go to the r to the inter-go to the inter-go to the interi, to the interi, to the r to-go to the inter-go-go-
In rare cases, risk workers from such a group may need respirators.
If a person is sick in the airplane, the safety of workers and other passengers is required, such as the isolation of a sick person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, the appointment of any member of the crew to care for a sick person, the provision of a mask or the treatment of such a person with a request to cover the nose and mouth with a cough or sneaking.
Secondary crew members should carry one-time medical gloves when approaching a sick traveller or in relation to physiological liquids or potentially infected surfaces and possibly additional personal protection if the patient has a heat, regular cough or respiratory difficulty.
Used gloves and other one-time items should be placed in a biologically safe bag and infected surfaces should subsequently be cleaned and disinfected. In cases with commercial shipships, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, the safety measures relate to the delaying of the journey in the event of illness, self-izolation and immediate information of the medical centre on the ship when there is heat or other symptoms on board.
In the ideal, medical examination should be conducted in the isolated cabinet of such a person. In the case of schools and care institutions, CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person is in the school building, regardless of the proliferation of the disease in the community.
With the minimum or medium level of dissemination of infection in the community, social distant strategies may be implemented, such as the cancellation of visits for personal meetings, meetings and other mass activities, such as exercises of physical or chronic singing, food reception in cafeteria, increased distance between ports, arrival and care control, limitation of non-existent visits, use of separate location of health institutions for children with flu symptoms.
At a considerable rate of dissemination in the local community, in addition to social distant strategies, the measures on the long-term absence of school may be considered to be low for law enforcement officials, in view of the CDC.
Law enforcement officers responsible for contacting persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of infection of COVID-19 are encouraged to follow the same instructions that are prescribed to the FELDSHERs, including the use of appropriate personnel protection.
When close contact occurs during detention, workers should clean and disinfect their formed belts and crews before reuse by house cleaning aircraft or by washing, observe standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of disease and use of personal protection, as well as using and washing clothes.
OSHA believes that some of the categories of health and morgue workers are highly or very highly risked.
High-risk posts include medical assistance, support, laboratory and medical transport staff, contacting patients with confirmed diagnosis or alleged COVID-19 infections.
They have a high risk of infection in the conduct of procedures accompanied by aerosol education, or in collecting/ processing of samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or expected COVID-19.
The procedures accompanied by the aerosol education include sensation, coughing, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and surveys or sampling invasive methods.
High-risk morgue workers are employees who are processing bodies with confirmed illness or suspicion of COVID-19 infected at the time of their death; if such officers have an autopsy, they are very highly risked; additional safety engineering for such groups include the use of isolated facilities for patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of COVID-19, including in the conduct of procedures accompanied by aerosol education.
In some health and morgue institutions, an effective measure may be the use of special ventilation with negative pressure.
The samples should be treated with the precautions provided for for biosafety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that allocate patients to different expectations zones depending on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other personal protection measures, OSHA recommends use of respirators at a distance of up to 6 feet with patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 as well as those conducting procedures accompanied by aerosol education.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved respirators for a N95 or higher-class-filter person should be used under the integrated written programme on respiratory protection, which indicates the requirements for individual fund selection and medical surveys.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for a staff member. WHO does not recommend use of specials, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease transmitted rather than because of physological liquidity.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for the patient's recruitment box.
Persons collecting samples from respiratory paths to patients with COVID-19 or transmitters of this disease without procedures accompanied by the aerosol education, WHO recommends that wear surgical masks, protective glasses or protect screens for the face, coat and gloves.
The N95 respirator or FFP2 should be carried in procedures accompanied by the aerosol education.
Given the inadequacy of individual protection in the world, WHO recommends that only those who provide direct care, minimise the need for such protection tools through the use of remote medicine, physical barriers, such transparency windows, access to the COVID-19 patient, only those who provide direct care, the use of the personal protection tools necessary for specific purposes, the continuing use of the same respirator, without taking off with multiple patients with identical diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain and recommendation not to use masks for persons with no symptoms.

TOTAL: [Covid-19] Relief of loading and preparation for the future
Date/time of amendment: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
RESOLUTIONS: CC0: Protected rights are not available
This month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that has brought light on the relationship of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We had no precedents of such problems, but we know that our efficiency depends on the ability to commiss, cooperate and develop communities worldwide, which is based on such organization.
We have observed the social and caring relationship between all our colleagues, which was reflected in the electronic mailing, calls, and chat, is an excellent confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, the amazing people are working with us.
I speak with great gratitude and pride about you as colleagues.
Last week, I was informed of the highest assessment of our work.
I was reminded of how important the opportunity for the world is to contact Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And this is possible because of your work, whether to ensure the work of sites, our colleagues, or the protection of the community.
The world needs information presented in Wikipedia, and today it is even more important than ever before.
At this time, not only what we do, but also how we do it is important to achieve significant results for the world.
With regard to the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the order of our joint work, starting from the next week.
Correction of the order of our work and schedules
As previously said by Robin, the c-team team was gathered yesterday to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
During the communication, we have considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
The suppressing majority of us wanted to remove the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to retire, let it be like that.
For all personnel, contractors and outdoor staff:
We expect to have to work about 4 hours per day or 20 hours a week before the following orders are received.
We do not announce the weekends: if you can work normally for more hours, this is permitted for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs are, whether you care about your family, acquire food or go to the doctor's reception, your welfare is our priority number one.
We're not watching your working time.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
It's clear and unquestionable, but we mention it.
No hospital leave or leave is required: just inform your manager and help the team to review the calendar and work schedule to ensure the coverage of key areas.
(If you have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, inform Bryan from T&C Ops, so that T&C can provide support and due attention from your situation).
The salary of the weather rates will be carried out in full.
We have already announced and reaffirmed our intention to fulfil our obligations to our contractors and staff with a time-payment rate.
Each person will receive payments in accordance with the normal time rates applicable under normal circumstances.
This, in particular, implies a period of sickness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use the job as a way to make their efforts towards peace around us.
What we do can bring amazing results, especially in these times.
And it's about self-help again.
We ask you to communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and we can correct our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered substantial.
We must always support such activities.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising teams are doing critically important work for which additional support may be required.
We initiate the process for all units to assess the current objectives and emphasize support, which is essential for our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we're just focusing on the most important projects.
The slowdown today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work “duplicately more to make up the missed” after the end of the pandemic.
You will not have to work overtime to comply with the unreal deadlines for the current time.
We acknowledge that the circumstances have changed, and we will work on the setting of new goals and deadlines, as possible.
What is going on with APP (annual plans)?
In order to create a new reality and expectations of the daily working time, we intend to adjust the time limits for the implementation of our Year Plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose a prolongation of time for our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for budgeting, allowing staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and care for the loved ones, and, while everyone who needs or wants to work, a short schedule will be made for the next few weeks.
Such duration allows significantly to reduce the current load of planning and tension throughout the organization.
The next week we will present our proposal to the Council, inform the representatives and the team of the relevant information on the following steps immediately after receiving the relevant confirmation.
Thank the APP team for the leadership of such work.
Status of office, risks and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco could be infected by COVID-19.
However, in addition to the number of precautions, we hired the antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the office in San Francisco.
They used anti-virus decisions of the medical class to disinfect all surfaces, as well as for reception and elevator halls that allow access to our floor.
The building applies to its own rules for caution with the use of products to ensure the safety of their renters.
We feel that the office will be well prepared until we decide to return.
Our office in Colombia (DC) is in the WeWork network, which shared with us and all the staff in DC with its rules related to COVID-19.
Last week, our office in the Colombia distant work was fully transferred in accordance with the instructions made in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the rental issue in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but can be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work out the first time.
Our old colleagues working remotely know about the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings be limited to one or two hours.
If you need longer sessions, consider how to break them into a course of several days.
Determine clearly the objective of the meeting, the agenda and previously disseminate materials for awareness.
Use video connections by default, to facilitate interaction and communications, use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For comfort, appoint a co-ordinator, a person who will monitor the delivery of issues in the chat and control the list of speakers, as well as the responsible for the conduct of notes (or joint concept).
If appropriate, please contact the e-mail technical support service.
Use your advantages on the Wellness Reimbursement program when you acquire breakfast.
Connect to the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution work.
The HR Operations team is studying the ergonomics guidelines available in the web format to promote the effectiveness of allocated work throughout the organization.
Last week, we asked all the recipients of the community to cancel the mass activities funded by Wikimedia, such as "editathons", until WHO announces the completion of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may result in the impossibleness of agreed grant activities, and no one will be punished for delays or change of such purposes.
In the next week, we will conduct follow-up activities with additional guidance on Wikiman, as well as other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
Universal moods in the global community are not only disturbance in the discontinuation of work but also a sense of relief in terms of understanding and the possibility of focusing on their own communities, Wikimedia, and not only.
With regard to the prospects, CRT is working on the Meta-Wiki page that will provide space for the community to monitor the impact and communication.
We remain on issues related to COVID-19
We will send a invitation to your calendar for a special meeting of staff to be held next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time we will use the opportunity to further share the relevant information, answer your questions and spend time together with each other.
We are together in this situation and are willing to help everything we can.
You can continue to receive information from such an e-mail and other important information on COVID-19 from the Wiki Office.
CRT will update such pages and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working on maintaining regular communications with personnel living in countries that have significantly affected the current situation.
If there are questions about travel, activities, key working streams, information lighting problems or otherwise, contact the CRT.
We are willing to support and communicate as necessary.
With confidentiality problems, please contact Brian Judan (Bryan Judan), director of HR International Global Operations.
No such changes should be considered as refusal from our work and our obligations.
Rather, this is the recognition of the possible ongoing need to adapt our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and to ensure that work can be continued, to provide the necessary support for our movement and the world through the necessary service.
Our plan will wait until the time is appropriate.
Today is the time to support each other and create a space for the important work that is ongoing in the coming weeks and perhaps months.
In order to do so, we will need help from each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, and to work with the maximum relief as soon as the need comes.
Now, please, wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and other participants of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
The enzyme of Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the external surface (cluster membranes) of cells in lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and wombs.
ACE2 contradicts the activity of the relevant angiotensin converter ferment (ACE), reducing the content of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution to treat cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as an entry point for certain coronavirs.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
The enzyme of Angiotensin 2 is a cync-containing metal-ferment located on the surface of endothel and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains the N-conclusive peptidasis domain M2 and the C-conclusive transport domain of renal amino acid collectrine.
ACE2 is a single membrane protein of type I, its fermentatively active domain falls on the surface of the cells of the lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 inclusive domain is vaccinated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddaza, and the solved protein is released into the blood and eventually released with urine.
ACE2 is present in the majority of organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most alveolar cells of type II, thin womb entreocites, arterial and venue endotelal cells and smooth muscles of most organs.
Biosynthesis of ACE2 iRNK is also found in the brain corridor, striatum, hypothalamus and brain marrow.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE contravention.
ACE dilutes angiotensin I hormone into condemning angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, vaccinates the carboxic amino acid of phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into a vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also dilute a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] - bradikinin, appeline, neurotensin, dinorfin A and greline.
ACE2 also regulates membrane transportation of SLC6A19 neutral amino acids and is present in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves the main point of entry to certain coronavirus, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-COV (vir caused by SARS); and SARS-COV-2 (covid-19).
To be strictly connected, the S1 protein spice of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the fermentative ACE2 domain on the surface of the cells leads to endocotos and translocation both of the virus and the enzyme into endosoms located within the cells.
This entry process also requires the S protein serial protease of the TMPRS2, whose inhibition is currently studied as a potential therapeutic tool, which led to some that ACE2 level reduction in cells could help to combat infections.
Nevertheless, many professional communities and regulatory bodies recommend that the standard therapy continue with APF and BRA inhibitors.
According to the systematic review and metaanalysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of APF inhibitors had a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34 per cent compared to the control group”.
Furthermore, “threatening of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients receiving APF inhibitors who have been more risked by inflammation, especially in patients with illness and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors has also been associated with reducing mortality from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than patients with a common risk of pneumonia.”
A recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a new innovation in therapy with acute injuries of the lung and apparently improves the lung haemodynamic and oxygen satisfaction in pigs with a respiratory insufficiency syndrome caused by lipopopolisaharids.
The semi-exhaust period rhACE2 is approximately 10 hours, and the start of action is 30 minutes, apart from the duration of the 24-hour impact.
Some data indicate that rhACE2 may be a multipromising tool for people with classic renin-angiotensic inhibitors (RAS ingibitors) or in diseases with an increase in angiotensin II. The introduced rhACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials in the treatment of a severe respiratory dystres syndrome.
The COVID-19 annexes are programming applications for mobile phones designed to assist in the epidemiological investigation in the 2019-20 pandemic of coronavir, i.e. in the detection of persons (contacts) that could contact an infected person.
In some regions, many applications officially supported by the authorities have been developed or proposed.
Several applications were developed to monitor contacts.
This raised a discussion on the issues of confidentiality, especially on those systems based on the geographical location of the app users.
Further softer options include the use of Bluetooth signals to register user closeness to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their efforts to integrate the functionality of such applications based on Bluetooth directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government, together with Alipay, launched an annex that allows citizens to check whether they had communicated with people infected by COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore it is a program called TraceTogether.
The application was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be transmitted to the Government. North Macedonia launched the StopKorona application, working at Bluetooth, helping track contacts with potentially infected persons and providing operational communications with health bodies.
The annex was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As at 14 April 2020, the app expected registration at Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking annex was at the final stage of the development and would be available for deployment within several weeks. Similar annexes are planned to be launched in Ireland and France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering the possibility of using applications on the basis of the Singapore App TraceTogether and the BlueTrace Protocol. Russia intends to use the application with a geosonation function, which aims to ensure that COVID-19 patients living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, the Professor for Security, the University of Cambridge, indicates a number of potential practical problems that can occur with systems based on annexes, including false work and potential ineffectiveness in the use of the application only by a small part of the population.
Given the concern of the dissemination of deceptive or harmful “coronavirus” annexes, Apple limited the list of organizations that can offer their applications related to the coronavirus to the App Store, including only “official or other reliable organizations” in this list.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
Participants of the Privacy Protection Campaign expressed concern about the consequences of the mass monitoring of the population through the applications related to the coronavirus; in particular, the question of whether the monitoring infrastructure created to combat the coronavir pandemic when the threat disappears.
The International Amnesty Organization and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for restriction of such surveillance.
The organizations announced eight conditions for public projects:
Observation should be “lagic, necessary and proportionate”;
Enlargement of monitoring and observation should be accompanied by reservations on the limitation of the deadline;
The use of data should be limited to the goals of combating COVID-19;
The safety and anonymity of the data should be protected and evidence of such protection should be provided;
Digital monitoring should exclude cases of achieving discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be determined at the level of legislation;
Protection against abuse should be guaranteed, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also published their list conditions.
Google and Apple offer their joint plan to address the problem of constant observation, which is to remove the monitoring mechanism from their operating systems as soon as it is necessary.
In some countries instead of annexes, network monitoring is used, which excludes the need to load the application and avoid monitoring.
In Israel, network tracking was approved.
Network solutions that have access to sources of location also have potential problems with confidentiality.
However, not all central server systems should have access to the location data; a number of confidentiality systems have been developed that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-core-based system was used to monitor contacts.
Instead of using a special application, the system collected information on tracking from various sources, including monitoring of mobile devices and transactions with maps, and then combined them to provide text messages that were sent to potentially infected persons.
The Government used this information not only to prevent citizens from potential contacts with infected persons, but also made information on the location of public access, which was possible due to substantial changes in the legislation on the protection of information that had been introduced after the MERS explosion in the country.
Access to such information can be obtained through a number of applications and websites, and countries, including Germany, are considering the possibility of using both centralized systems and confidential systems.
As at 6 April 2020, the details have not yet been published.
Tracking of contacts where confidentiality remains is a sustainable concept, a significant number of research literature dated at least 2013. As at 7 April 2020, more than ten expert groups have worked on decisions providing confidentiality, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register user approach to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts, including both centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized tracing of confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), protocols to ensure confidentiality, monitoring mechanisms (PACT) and other.
These protocols are responsible for never leaving the device, and all the comparisons were on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform to maintain confidentiality in collecting and using data on location or crossing ways to monitor the distribution of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on the studies contained in the document Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic (Huligan annexes: how to maintain confidentiality during the epidemic), published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a company that develops confidentiality technology, which was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technologies that allow users to exchange confidential data on location and health with other users and officials without risking the confidentiality of those data.
On 5 April 2020, a global TCN coalition had been established by groups dividing the same approach and using similar protocols, aiming at reducing fragmentation and ensuring global compatibility of the monitoring and notification applications, which is a key factor in their widespread dissemination.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it opened the source code of BlueTrace used in its official application.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control mobile platforms Android and iOS, announced a contact monitoring initiative that they claimed to ensure confidentiality, and which is based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography to maintain confidentiality.
They also published the technical features of basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system must be developed in three stages:
Deployment of instruments allowing Governments to create official applications to monitor the movement of civilians infected by the coronavirus, but with the preservation of data confidentiality
Integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plans to solve permanent monitoring problems, first introducing the system through the update of the operational system and then removing it in the same way after the threat disappeared.
Repository of the medicinal product (also known as reprofiling, redirection, changing tasks or therapeutic redirection) is the reprofiling of the approved medicinal product to treat the disease or medical condition excellent from the disease initiated in the development.
This is one of the scientific studies that is currently used to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment methods.
Other studies include the development of COVID-19 vaccine and the transfusion of reconvalescent plasma. SARS-COV-2 contains about 66 proteins affecting medicinal products, each of which has several leagues.
Analysis of these linking parts is an appropriate basis for developing an effective antiviral product against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important protein targets for SARS-CoV-2 are the papain-like protease, the RNA-dependent RNA-polimeraze, helicopter, S proteins and ADF-ribophosphatease.
Hussein AA and coautors in their doclinical study have studied several candidates, which were then optimized, and analyzed their similarity on the structure of the most approved medicinal products to accelerate the development of high-effective SARS-COV-2 medicinal product, which would be recommended for clinical studies.
Chlorochin is an anti-omalary medicine that is also used to treat some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March WHO announced that chlorochin and associated hydroxichlorochin would be included in four medicinal products studied under the clinical test “Solidarity”.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Kuomo, announced that the tests of chlorochin and hydroxychlorochin would begin in New York on 24 March. On 28 March, FDA authorized the use of hydroxychlorochin and chlorochin phosphate in accordance with the emergency authorisation (EUA).
The treatment scheme was not approved during the FDA clinical trials and was only permitted in accordance with EUA as an experimental treatment for immediate assistance for patients who were hospitalized but cannot be treated by clinical trial schemes.
The CDC stated that “the order of use, dose or duration of hydroxychlorochin for prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2” has not yet been established.
The doctors say they use the medicinal product when there is no other way out.
The Turkish Research Group in Istanbul conducted a small study on the use of chlorochin in combination with cinka and vitamins A, C and D.
High-scale studies are conducted at the Duke University and the Oxford University.
The New York University Medical School in Langon studies the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychlorochin.
The Chinese clinical trials in Uhan and Shenchen showed that the favipiravir was “efficient”.
35 patients in Shenchen who administered this medicinal product have received negative results on average in 4 days, while 45 patients who were not taking the medicine were 11 days.
A study was conducted in Uhan with 240 patients with pneumonia, one half of which received favipiravir, and the other half was umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Office reminded the public that the results of the effectiveness of the product were poor and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that for the completion of its stocks, the drug would be purchased in Japan and that it would be used by military resources to deliver it to university hospitals where the medicinal product would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Sindzo Abe reported to Tramp's administration that the drug purchase could be less effective in the illness-related cases.
It may be dangerous for pregnant patients or for patients who are trying to become pregnant.
A study on the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antiviral medicinal products (Kaletra) concluded that “efficiency in use has not been detected”.
The preparations were developed to incite the replication of HIV by linking to the protease.
The Student Group of Colorado University is trying to modify medicinal products to find a link to the SARS-CoV-2 Protease. The scientific community criticizes the reprofiling of medicines specially developed for HIV and AIDS.
WHO included a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the international solidarity test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of the Ebola virus and the Marbour virus infections. The Gilead Sciences have later discovered that the remdesivir has antivirus activity in vitro with regard to the multiple philosophy, pneumo, paramixo and coronavirus.
One of the problems related to antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and transmission.
Some early preliminary studies show that the remdecivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance; there are currently several clinical trials, including two Cleveland university clinics; one is conducted in patients with moderate forms of disease, and the other is in patients with a more severe form.
Three clinical trials are currently conducted for the internal introduction of vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).
On 24 March 2020, the antibiotics of acidromicine began in New York.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans a clinical study of Alvesco (cyclosonide) Tajina, the inhalation corticosteroid for the treatment of astma, for its use in the treatment of pre-symptomic patients infected by the new coronavir.
The test of phase II, the form of angiotensin converting ferment 2 is conducted with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria who have been hospitalized with severe forms of disease to determine the efficacy of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with poorly expressed COVID-19 symptoms.
A study called COLCORONA was invited to 6,000 adults aged 40 years and older who had diagnosed COVID-19 with light symptoms without hospitalization.
Pregnant, breast-feeding and non-used contraceptives, women cannot participate in this study.
There are several coagulants at the test in Italy.
The low-lectoral heparin is widely used to treat patients, which encouraged the Italian Medicinal Products Department to publish recommendations on the use of this medicine.
On 14 April, a multicentral study in Italy was announced with 300 patients on the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-COV-2 is a virus, significant scientific attention was focused on reprofiling approved antivirus drugs developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and Western Nile virus.
Fisheries: Ribavirin was recommended for COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics, which have been considered potentially useful for the use of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6): approved in China.
Also tests in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavir 2019 (CIVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical trials, many attempts to develop such a vaccine continue to be taken.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect the vaccine against the SARS-COV-2 to be obtained sooner than 18 months later.
Five candidates for vaccines were conducted in April in phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 virus was identified in December 2019.
In 2020, the major explosion of this disease broadcasted around the world, leading to significant investment in the development of vaccine and research activities.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-COV-2.
As announced in April, the key tasks of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, production power, extensive deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, there were 10 different technological platforms to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in phase I safety studies:
Nuclein acid (DNA and RNA) (Fase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, IRK-1273)
Viral vector (Fase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biology, Adenovirus vector of type 5)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, 115 potential vaccines are at early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute); additional 37 candidates have been reported, but there is little public information (such as they are at stages of planning or development).
In phases I-II, preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests are usually conducted by randomised, placebo-controlled and in several placebo-controlled areas with a concomitant definition of more precise and effective doses.
The test phase III usually covers more participants, including the control group; the preparations are tested for the effectiveness of the prevention of disease and are simultaneously monitored by side effects in optimum doses.
Of 79 vaccine candidates actively designed (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested on a person (they are still at the stage of doclinical studies).
On 24 January 2020, the Queensland University, Australia, announced that the potential of a molecular vaccine is explored, which genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate immune reactions.
On 24 January 2020, the International Centre for Vaccines (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the start of work on its own vaccine in order to start a human test in 2021.
The launch of vaccines projects was also announced in the China Control and Prevention Centre on 26 January 2020 and the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On 29 January 2020, the Janssen pharmaceutical companies, head of Hanneke Schuitmaker, announced the start of the establishment of their vaccine.
Jansen and his partner on biotechnology, Vaxart, develop oral vaccine.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a productive partnership with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
OncoGen in Romania, on 8 February 2020, published a paper on technology vaccine design, similar to the vaccine used for the vaccine against cancer neoantigen.
On 25 March, the Scientific Research Institute announced the completion of the vaccine synthesis and the start of testing.
On 27 February 2020, the daughter's company Generalex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that the project for the development of a peptid vaccine Ii-Key v. COVID-19.
Their goal was to develop a vaccine candidate that could be tested for people within 90 days.
On 5 March 2020, the Washington University in St. Louis announced its vaccine development projects.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army of Medical Research and Logistics, Fort Detrik, and the Scientific Army Institute of Walter Reed, Silver Spring, who are located in the western part of Maryland, announced their vaccine.
On 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that partnerships with Novavax Inc.
for the development and production of vaccine.
Partners also announced doclinical tests and clinical trials of phase I by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients and that even in an accelerated vaccine development would take at least one and a half years.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company, Quebec, reported that partial funding by the Canadian Institute for Health Studies was established by a particle like a coronavir.
The potential vaccine is carried out in laboratory studies, and human testing is planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week The Guardian reported that the President of the United States Donald Tramp offered CureVac “great money” for exclusive access to Covid-19 vaccine, and the Government of Germany expressed its protest against it.
On 17 March 2020, the U.S. Pfizer pharmaceutical company announced a partnership with the German BioNTech to jointly develop a vaccine based on IRK.
BNT162 is a vaccine candidate based on IRNA; the preparation is currently being tested in the doclinical process and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, the Italian Biotech company Takis Biotech announced that in April 2020 it would receive the results of doclinical tests, and their final vaccine candidate could be tested on people in the autumn.
On 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovation in the field of Preparation for epidemic (CEPI), France announced $4.9 million in the COVID-19 Consortion, with the participation of the Institute of Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vina, Austria) and the Pittsburgh University. The overall investment of CEPI in the development of a vaccine from COVID-19 amounts to $29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners in developing COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland universities.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists started testing six different animal vaccines candidates.
Researchers of Imperial College, London, announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-amplifiable RNA vaccine from COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate has been developed for 14 days after acquisition of a sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced 275 million dollars to fund 96 research projects against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University.
Approximately at the same time, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of 192 million of Canadian dollars special to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans for the establishment of a national vaccine bank, where a number of new vaccines could be used in the case of a new explosion of the coronavir.
On 2 April 2020, researchers from the Pittsburgh Medical School reported the PittCoVacc, possible vaccine against COVID-19 on mouses, saying that “MNA introduced SARS-COV-2 S1, causing strong responses to antigen-specific antibodies [in mouse] that had occurred two weeks after immunization”.
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian Pharmaceutical School of the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential vaccine based on DNA, which may be released in form of nazal spray.
The DNA bacteriophases will multiply within human bacteria and create harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-COV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, industry and three U.S. universities combined IBM supercomputer resources, combined with the cloud calculations of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have haeterological effects, also referred to as non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other advantages than those in preventing diseases.
Another randomised study conducted in Australia covers 4170 health workers.
Developed vaccines may be insecure or ineffective.
Early studies on the efficiency of vaccines using animal models characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2 transgenous mouses, other laboratory animals and lower primates, indicate the need for biosafe infection measures 3 in the processing of live viruses, as well as international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
The vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested on animal models.
As for 2020, there are no medicinal products or protective vaccines that would be safe and effective for people.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of atypical pneumonia was the priority for Governments and public health institutions worldwide, and there is also no vaccine checked against MERS.
When the MERS began to spread, it was considered that the SARS study that was conducted at that time could be a standard for developing vaccines and therapeutic means against MERS-COV infection.
As in March 2020, there was one (based on DNA) vaccine from MERS, which passed phase I of clinical trials on humans, and three other vaccines, all of which were vaccines based on a virus vector and were in the development process, two were adenovirous (CHAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social networks broadcasted theory of the conspiracy, which claimed that COVID-19 virus is not new and that the vaccine exists.
Publications in social networks quoted the words of some patients who claimed that there were patents on the genetic sequences of other cronavir species, such as SARS coronavir and vaccines for these species.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (CIVID-19), a infectious disease caused by a severe respiratory syndrome of coronavir 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and breathing difficulty.
Other symptoms may include tiredness, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
From the first occurrence of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but it may also varies between two and fourteen days.
Most of the symptoms are affected by light symptoms, but in some cases the disease is transmitted to viral pneumonia and polyorganised insufficiency.
As at 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million infections were registered in 210 countries and regions, more than 153,000 have died from this disease.
More than 568,000 people are healed, and the virus is mainly distributed when people are closely contacted, often through microscopic drops that are released in air by coughing, chewing or conversation.
Although these drops are formed at the exhaust, they are usually threatened by falling on the ground or on the surface, but are not transmitted through air at large distances.
People are also infected with the polluted surface and then their eyes, noses or mouth.
The virus may live on the surface within 72 hours.
It is most infected in the first three days after the symptoms occur, although its dissemination may be possible before symptoms and at more late stages. The standard diagnostic method is a polymerous chain reverse transcryption in real time (RT-PCR) on a sample, taken as a swallow of the nose.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with suspicion of illness and for those who care for them.
Recommendations on the use of medical masks are different: some departments recommend not to use them at all, some recommend their use and others require it.
The vaccine or specific treatment of COVID-19 are currently missing.
The local dissemination of disease was registered in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may not have symptoms or symptoms of flu such as fever, cough, tiredness and breathing.
Extreme symptoms include a difficult breathing, a constant pain or a sense of pressure in the breast, awareness confusion, awakening difficulties, awakening of face or lips; if the above symptoms are present, should be called for medical assistance immediately.
Senior symptoms of upper respiratory paths such as sneaking, sneaking or throat pain may be observed.
There are also a variety of percentages of abdominal symptoms such as mutilation, mutilation and diarrhoea.
Some of the diseases registered in China were initially manifested only by the feeling of breast pressure and heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease may progress in the development of pneumonia, polyorganised insufficiency, and eventually death.
This is called the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five or six days, but may variete between two and 14 days.
97.5 per cent of people start to experience symptoms within 11.5 days after the infection. According to available data, the symptoms are not shown in all infected.
The role of such unsymptomic carriers in the transmission of disease is still unknown, but preliminary data indicate that they can contribute to the proliferation of infection.
The percentage of infected persons with unsymptomic disease is currently unknown, but it is only studying, while the Korean control and prevention centres (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalization on the virus was unsymptomous.
The National Health Commission of China began to include non-symptomic cases in its daily summary of 1 April; from 166 infections registered on that day, 130 (78%) have denied unsymptomic during the testing.
And wetness and snow can have a large concentration of the virus.
More drops in the air when speaking loudly than speaking normal loudness.
A study conducted in Singapore showed that the drops can be spread at a distance of 4.5 feet (15 feet) at open cough.
The virus is generally not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences assumed that the transmission of particles of the virus by bioaerosolate means is still possible, and the air testing processed by air collectors located in corridors outside the human rooms showed the existence of the virus RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiovascular reanimation (HLR) may lead to exhaust products and therefore to air-proliferation.
There are also concerns that the virus can be spread through fecalies, however, is considered low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; the proliferation of the virus is possible before symptoms occur, but the risk is small.
The European Centre for Prevention and Control of Disease (ECDC) staff argue that it is not quite clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one is usually infected by 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive on the surface from a few hours to a few days.
In particular, it was discovered that on the card surface the virus was able to live within one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on a non-free steel (AISI 304), up to three days, and 99 per cent of copper surfaces were up to 4 hours.
These indicators, however, varies depending on moisture and temperature.
The sauce and washing tools in their proper use have a very useful effect in combating the infection: the sauce destroys the fat protective layer of the virus, deactivating it in this way and able to remove it from the surfaces of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalconium chloride and chlorphexidine gluconate (surgery disinfecting) are less effective against the virus. During the study conducted in Hong Kong, the samples of the sline were taken in the mean two days after the hospitalization.
The five of the six patients had the first test showed the highest concentration of the blood virus, and the sixth patient had the highest blood content of the blood.
The severe severe respiratory cornavir syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new sharp, sharp coronavir respiratory syndrome, first discovered in three people with pneumonia from a group with sharp respiratory diseases registered in Uhaan.
All signs of a new SARS-COV-2 are also encountered in the nature of coronavirs.
Without human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic sauce that opens its protective shell. SARS-COV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-COV.
The lungs are the body most affected by COVID-19, because the virus is infiltrated into the household cells through angiotensin transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2), most common in the alveolar cells of type II.
The virus is connected to ACE2 and infiltrated into the master's cell using the character surface glycoprotein, the “ship” (peplomer).
12 per cent of the infected people in the Uhana hospital have been diagnosed with a severe miocardial injury, which is more frequently occurring in a severe form of disease.
The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms highly due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during the progression of the disease, but the sharp miocard damage may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large numbers because they are participating in the work of the body.
High frequency of trombosis (31%) and vein thromboembolic (25%) was observed in patients in OIT with COVID-19 and may indicate disadvantaged forecasts. Autopia of patients killed by COVID-19 showed the existence of difuse alveolar damages (DAD) and lymphocytocito-containing inflammatory inflammatory inflammation in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 is tropical to ACE2-expressive respiratory cells, patients with severe COVID-19 experience symptoms of systemic hyperfusion.
In particular, it was found that the pathogenic GM-CFS T cells correlated with the recruitment of IL-6 inflammatory monocytes and the severe patology of lungs in patients with COVID-19.
The autopsy was also identified by lymphocitar infiltrates.
WHO has also published several test protocols on this disease.
The polymerous chain reaction in real time mode (RT-PCR) is a standard test method.
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained from the nose-swallow, but can also be used by a nose or wet.
The results are usually ready for a period of hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be taken, but they require two blood samples taken within two weeks and their results are not directly relevant.
Chinese scientists have managed to acquire the cronavir championship and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists around the world can self-develop tests by a polymerous chain reaction (PCP) to identify the existence of this virus.
As at 4 April 2020, antibodies tests that could detect the infection for the current time and the possible infection in the past had not yet been widespread.
China's experience of test results showed that their accuracy was only 60 to 70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the U.S. Food Quality Control and Medicinal Products Management Office (FDA) approved the first diagnostic test on the site by authorising it to be applied at the end of this month.
Bilateral multilateral subplaural focuses on the type of " mathematical glass" with peripheral, assymmetrical and territorial distribution are frequent symptoms shown at the early stage of the disease.
Subpleural domination, the symptom of a bridge (substantial thickness of the barrier with a variable alveolar fill) and consolidation develops as the disease is progressed.
There are few data on microscopic damages and COVID-19 pathophiology.
Core results of the autopsy pathological study:
Macroscopy: Pleasure, perikardity, pulmonary intestines and lungs
Four types of gravity of virus pneumonia can be observed:
light form of pneumonia: lungs, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atipical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocitar infiltration and multinuclear giant cell education
severe form of pneumonia: Diffusive alveolar injury (DAD) with difuse alveolar exhaust.
DAD is the cause of a severe respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Enhancing pneumonia: organize exhausts in alveolar lines and lung interstitional fibrosis.
Blood: Diffusive intraintestinal rotation (DVS syndrome); leucoerythraplast response
Prevention measures to reduce the probability of infection include staying at home, avoiding human places, frequent washing of hands with sauce and water for at least 20 seconds, compliance with the rules of respiratory hygiene, as well as avoiding touching to the eyes, nose or mouth with imminent hands.
CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a cough or sneeze, or, if there is no sausage, covering the mouth and nose on the inside side of the elbow zone.
After coughing or chishing, quality hygienic procedure is recommended.
The Centre for Control and Prevention of Disease (CDC) recommends use in public places of fabric masks, in particular in order to reduce the transfer of infections to persons with unsymptomic illness. The social distance strategies aim at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; these measures have been closed by schools and enterprises, limited movement of citizens and large public activities have been cancelled.
Recommendations on distance also suggest that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) from each other.
Since the completion of the vaccine is expected not earlier than 2021, the majority of COVID-19 measures against the proliferation of the COVID-19 is to reduce the epidemic peak known as “exit to salary”.
CDC also recommends to wash your hands more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with severe arm pollution, and before food and after coughing, coughing or sneaking.
CDC also recommends the use of disinfecting spirt content (as least 60 per cent) for hand processing, but only when sauce and water are not available. Where such disinfective means are not sold, WHO provides two local production receptures.
These components use ethanol or isopropanol with antimicrobial activity.
The hydrogen transmission is used to eliminate bacterial disputes in spirts and is not a suitable tool for antiseptic hand processing.
Glycerol is added as a moist.
Patients have shown supporting therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other defeated vital bodies.
CDC recommends to those who suspect that they are infected by the virus to wear a normal medical mask.
Extracorporal membrane oxigenation (ECMO) was used to address the problem of respiratory inadequacy, but its advantages were still being studied.
In order to strengthen immunity, the rules of personal hygiene, healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended.
The supportive therapy methods can be shown to patients with light symptoms at early stages of disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, doctors of intensive therapy and pulmonologists summarized therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in free resources, IBCC.
As at April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the treatment of symptoms as first-line medicinal products, some medical workers recommend choosing for paracetamol (acetaminophene) compared to ibuprofen.
In the implementation of the procedures in which air-capped emissions, such as intubation or hand-cutting, are required to take precautions to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in the medical institutions.
The CDC recommends that additional measures be placed in the air-capped isolation (AIIR) other than standard precautions in contact and air. CDC has published recommendations for individual protection (SIS) during the pandemic.
Recommended individual protection means: protective coat, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves. From the above, it is preferable to use respirators rather than medical masks.
N95 respirators are approved for use in industrial conditions, but FDA authorized the use of these respirators in accordance with the immediate authorisation for use (EUA).
They are intended to protect from particles in the air, such as dust, but in the case of non-instruction, the effectiveness of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, CDC recommends the use of protective face screens or, in particular, make masks alone in domestic conditions.
In most cases, COVID-19 is not difficult to require artificial light ventilation or its alternative, but there is a certain percentage of cases where it is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for respiratory patients with respiratory insufficiency related to COVID-19 is currently actively studied, while some evidence are available to avoid intubation through a nose oxygen canyle with an intensive air flow or two-level respiratory pressure in respiratory routes.
Not yet known whether any of these two ways for patients in critical state is as effective as the IVL.
Some physicians choose for the invasive lung ventilation, if available, as this method significantly limits the distribution of particles in the air compared to the nose canal with the intensive air flow. The risk of severe disease for older people (they aged 60 years and especially those aged 80 years of age) is much higher.
In many developed countries, there are lack of hospital cocks per person, and the resources of health systems are too limited to deal with rapidly the number of COVID-19 infections in a severe form that requires hospitalization.
According to one study conducted in China, 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive therapy offices, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for the work of light ventilations, and 1.4 per cent ended.
In China, approximately 30 per cent of people who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 have eventually been recovered.
The artificial ventilation task of the light is complicated because the sharp respiratory dystress syndrome (ARDS) developing at COVID-19 is increasingly oxygenated.
The IVL, with the support of respiratory pressure and PDCs, is necessary to deliver the maximum quantity of oxygen into the light and to ensure the minimum injury of the ventilation, resulting in the development of the pneumotorex.
In the early ventilator models, the high VAT may be unavailable.
Studies of potential treatment began in January 2020, and several antiviral medicinal products are currently in clinical trials.
Remdesivir is the most prospective.
The development of new medicinal products may last until 2021, but some of the tested medicinal products have already been approved for other purposes or are at the latest stages of testing.
Antivirus can be tested in patients with severe forms of disease.
WHO-recommended volunteers participate in the tests of effective and safety of potential treatment, and FDA has provided temporary authorisation for the use of reconvalescent plasma as an experimental treatment when human life is threatened by serious or immediate dangers.
Its application was not subject to clinical studies that should be conducted for proving the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to combat the illness.
For login, users must enter their name and identification number.
The annex may identify “near contact” through monitoring data and thus determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-isolation but also sends notification to local health authorities. Analyses of large data collected from mobile phones, recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intellect are used to track infected persons and persons with whom they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security authorities to track the mobile phones of people who are allegedly infected by the coronavir.
Measures were taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who may become in contact with infected citizens.
Also, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom provided aggregated data on the location of mobile subscribers to the federal public institutions of Germany and the Robert Koha Institute for the purpose of research and preventing the spread of the virus.
In Russia, quarantine violents were introduced in the identification technology.
The Regional Health Commissioner of Italy, Julio Gallera, said that mobile network operators reported that “40 per cent of people continue to move across the territory”.
The German Government has spent a 48-hour weekend programming maraton, in which more than 42,000 participants participated.
The President of Estonia, Kersty Calulaide, also called for creative decisions against the proliferation of the coronavir.
People may be stressed about quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor's words: “Intense social isolation, loneliness, health concern, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harming mental health and human well-being.”
Disease may occur in a light form with minor or unavailable symptoms similar to other common respiratory diseases such as normal cold.
Patients with light forms of disease are generally healed within two weeks, while the treatment of severe or critical patients may take three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may be more risked to obtain a heavy form of COVID-19 based on other viruses such as SARS and MERS, although there are no such data on COVID-19.
Persons with the most severe condition of COVID-19 may advance quickly into a sharp respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory insufficience, septic shock or polyorganised inadequacy.
The COVID-19 complications include sepse, anonymous thrombosis, as well as heart problems, kidneys and baking.
Thrombo-educing anomalies, especially the increase in protrombin time, were described in 6 per cent of patients in the COVID-19 hospital, while the breast function was observed in 4 per cent of the group.
Approximately 20 to 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19 have increased liver enzymes (transaminase).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, of which five patients were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to intensive therapy was seven days.
According to studies in early stages, the average period from the initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), male mortality was 2.8 per cent and 1.7 per cent among women.
Hystopatological studies of post-mortal lung samples indicate a difussed alveolar injury with cell fibromixoid exhausts in both lungs.
Pneumocytes have experienced viral cytopathic changes.
Easy appearance was like a sharp respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS).
11.8 per cent of the deaths registered by the National Health Commission of China were heart problems in improving troponin or heart stoping.
According to the information provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of the hospitalized patients had previous health problems, and the availability of health and the social and economic situation in the region could also affect mortality.
Dependence of mortality depending on the condition is varied because of such regional differences and due to methodological difficulties.
Insufficient calculation of cases in a light form may lead to a higher rate of mortality.
However, the fact that deaths occur from the diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is undervalued.
Smokers have had severe symptoms of COVID-19 in general 1,4 times more, and such patients needed approximately 2.4 times intensive therapy or died compared to non-smoking.
The administration of one of the Hong Kong clinic found that some patients who have been treated with this disease have decreased by 20 to 30 per cent, and their scans have detected damage.
After healing, this may also lead to the syndrome after intensive therapy.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether patients who were treated with the virus were steadily immunity against it.
According to other coronavirs, this was considered likely, but was also reported when the COVID-19 coronavirus tests were still positive after the recovery of COVID-19.
It is estimated that in these cases there was an increased duration of disease rather than reinfected.
It is considered natural, animal origin and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely caused by the human transmission.
The study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls on 1 December 2019 the early date of the first illness.
According to the official data published by WHO, this date was 8 December 2019.
Several methods are usually used for quantitative mortality assessment.
All figures are varied depending on the region and the time of dissemination, and they also affect the quality of the testing, the quality of health systems using the treatment scheme, from the beginning of the disease and the parameters of the population, such as age, gender and general health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO adopted illness codes for ICB-10: U07.1 — for deaths from the laboratory confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 — for deaths from clinical or epidemiologically diagnosticated COVID-19 without a laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. The ratio of deaths and infections is the number of deaths shared in the number of diagnostic cases during a certain period of time.
According to the statistics of the University of Jones Hopkins, as at 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9 per cent (153 822/2 240 191).
This number is varies depending on the region. Some other methods include the determination of the mortality rate due to the disease (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnostic patients who have suffered from disease and the determination of the mortality rate as a result of transmissible infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (as diagnosticated, as well as undiagnosed cases) of disease.
These statistics are not bound for specific time and reflect the indicators of a certain layer of population from the time of infection until the disease is completed.
Although the antibodies are not produced in all infected patients, the presence of such antibodies can be seen by how many people have been infected.
In an epicentre of explosion in Italy, Castillon D'Adda, a small village with a population of 4600 people, 80 people (1.7 per cent) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease was spread during the celebration of the youth karneval, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could have been formally classified as such.
Furthermore, Germany's health system has not been overloaded.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3 per cent of the population can have antibodies, according to donor blood indicators.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population).
The impact of pandemia and mortality is different for men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher in men.
The highest risk group is men over 50 years old; the breakdown between men and women is only reduced from the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for this distinction are unknown but may be genetic and behaviour factors.
Gender immunological differences, reduced smoking among women associated with men’s diseases (e.g. hypertension in men younger than women) may cause higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected men were infected, and 72 per cent of the deaths of COVID-19 had been caused by men.
As at April 2020, the Government of the United States does not conduct gender statistics on COVID-19.
Research has shown that virus diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu and ORVI have different gender statistics.
Most healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women, accordingly, more likely to be infected.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of this disease -- COVID-19.
The WHO leader, Mr. Tedros Adan Gabriel, explained: “CO” means “coron”, “VI” is “virus”, “D” is “illness” (disease”), and 19 when the explosion was first discovered: 31 December 2019.
The name was selected to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), species of animals or groups of people, as required by international recommendation for the prevention of stigmatization. The COVID-19 virus is called a severe cronavirous respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
In public communications, WHO also uses the terms “COVID-19” and “virus responsible for COVID-19”.
And the disease, and the virus itself is usually called coronavirus.
During the initial explosion in Uhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly called “coronavir” and “smoking coronavirus”.
In January 2020, in accordance with the recommendations of 2015 on the use of geographical sites in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended that the terms of “acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” be used as temporary names of virus and disease.
The official names “CIVID-19” and “SARS-COV-2” were published on 11 February 2020.
Because of the limits of the standard supply chains, some digital services producers print medical materials such as tampones for nose wires, as well as details of IVL devices.
In one of these cases, the Italian clinic needed an urgent ventilation valve and the supplier could not deliver it within the required periods, then one of the local productions had been reprofiled and could print the necessary 100 valves per night.
After the first phenomenon of COVID-19, the Internet broadcasted high-speedly various theories of conspiracy, dezinformation and facial information on the origin of the virus, its scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects.
People may likely be infected by other animals.
Studies did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
At present, there is no approved vaccine from a virus or medicine for treatment.
Government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers are currently conducting various international studies of vaccines and medicines from COVID-19.
In March, WHO launched the SOLIDARITITY Trial programme (SOLIDARNOTY Example), which aims at assessing the treatment effect of four existing links that are considered the most effective to date.
Prepared vaccine does not exist yet, but various organizations actively develop vaccine candidates.
SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 are infiltrated into human cells by the ACE2 receptor, so the results of previous SARS-COV studies are used in scientific developments.
There are three vaccine strategies.
First, researchers seek to create a whole-virional vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether an inactive or dead form, is intended to cause a rapid immune response of the human body to the new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a single vaccine, is intended to create a vaccine that increases the immune system's sensitivity to certain virus subjects.
In the case of SARS-COV-2, such studies are aimed at destruction of the S-shide protein that helps the virus enter the receptor of the ACE2.
The third strategy is to develop a vaccine based on nuclein acids (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new vaccine creation method).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be verified for safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical test of the vaccine in four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an inadequate genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. The anti-safe increase was identified as one of the potential problems in the development of vaccines from SARS-COV-2, but this assumption is disputed.
More than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted as at April 2020.
The preparations approved for malaria were evaluated during seven tests, four of these studies were based on hydroxichlorochin or chlorochin.
The reprofillation of antiviral medicinal products is a majority of Chinese studies; at the end of April, nine phase III studies were conducted in several countries.
As at April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidates for treatment of COVID-19 was conducted, and for that purpose several other existing antivirus medicines for COVID-19, including remdesivir, chlorochin and hydroxylorochin, lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as lopinavir / ritonavir, combined with beta interferon.
As at March 2020, preliminary data on the effectiveness of the remdecivier are available.
The clinical improvement was observed in patients who received remdesivire as an exception.
The use of chlorochin used earlier for malaria was considered in China in February 2020.
Nevertheless, there is a need for an expert assessment of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chlorochin.
The Uhan Institute of Virusology recommends a single daily dose, but notes that doubled the dose is very dangerous and can lead to an expiry.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use of hydroxichlorochin and chlorochin for doctors treating patients with COVID-19. The Chinese instructions of the 7th edition also indicate interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir as means against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-COV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for a detailed study of in vivo by demonstrating the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations. Studies showed that SARS-COV-2 should be taken into contact with the ACE2 receptor with a protein of transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2).
Studies of the use of chlorochin and hydroxychlorochin with azitromicin or without it have serious restrictions that do not allow the medical community to use these treatment methods without more detailed study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-COV-2 in vitro and its role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Hypercytokinemy may occur as complications at the late stages of the severe form of COVID-19.
There are confirmations that hydroxychlorochin may have the properties of hypercytokine, and a small study carried out by the National Health Commission of China included a tocilizumab in the recommendation on coronavir treatment.
This medicinal product came to two stages of a non-randomized test conducted at the national level in Italy after the positive results of its use were received in patients with severe form of disease.
In combination with the ferritin blood serum analysis for cytokin storms, it is intended to counter the factors that are considered to be caused by death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved antagonist of the interlejkine-6 receptor on the basis of retrospective thematic studies for the treatment of the CAR steroid cytocrine syndrome for the release of other refracter cytokines, caused by another cause, the CAR T cell therapy.
There is no randomised and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective means of treating the cytokine exemption syndrome.
The transfer of cleaned and concentrated antibodies produced by immune systems of patients treated with COVID-19 to those who need them is now considered a non-captive method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested in the treatment of SARS patients, but its results were uncertain.
The neutralization of the virus is the expected effect by which passive therapy with antibodies can protect from SARS-COV-2.
However, the use of other mechanisms, such as the anti-body cytotoxicity and/or fagocytosis, is possible.
Other forms of passive therapy with antibodies, such as monochlonic antibodies, are at the stage of development.
The use of the reconvalescent blood sulphur, consisting of a liquid part of the blood of the healed patients, may increase and contains antibodies against the virus.

Lee Venjljan, a doctor of the Uhanja Central Clinic, who later infected and died from COVID-19 after he reported the spread of the virus.
