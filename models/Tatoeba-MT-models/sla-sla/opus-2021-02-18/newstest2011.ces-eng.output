CHSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or sugar
The new CSSD council council will, in all, have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old colleagues from ODS in Prague and representation.
The journal Currently.cz members of the new Council of the CSSD "Tested", as they know the notorially introduced slang, which was created in the city during the last years when Prague ruled by the current coalition partners.
The Coded Dictionary, which the Prague Political Puzzle introduced during the previous era of Primator Paul Bem, describes some of the most famous figures, situations and causes in the metropolitan.
Surprisingly, the new council does not understand much.
At least he says.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I am in Prague politics rather a new man," he responded to the test of the "kmetrovski" dictionary of the Council for Culture, Lukas Kaucki.
And while it was about a political veteran, he responded similarly to Council Carl Brezina.
Like a golf hole.
"It's the only expression of those you're offering me, which I sometimes use."
"I don't recognise the slang generally."
From a vocabulary whose expressions the journal Currently.cz published this year in June before the OSS election convention, she chose six examples, mostly those who are notoriously connected to the Prague magistrate.
Socialists were supposed to explain the words "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "to go to the sugarhouse", "beautiful necks", "traity of the capital" and "pleasant".
Three of the councils agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who is head of Prague school in future - first promised an interview, later but no longer answered the phone.
The fifth council Peter Vallinek just refused the test.
"I'm not dealing with these things at all, and as civil democrats enjoy it, I'm not going to evaluate."
"I am now dealing with how we understand each other within our programs," he responded.
As it has already been said, Councilman Lukas Kaucki would not have known in the title above that it is an influenced businessman and a friend of the exhibitor of Bem Roman Janousk.
"Voldmort" tells him nothing, and the only term that he correctly estimated in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's Blanka Tunnel," says Kaucki, and immediately adds, "But I know it more from the newspaper."
"I'll have to pay some language course," he jokes.
The golf hole then, as the Blanka Tunnel Management, decrypts not only the matador Karel Brezina but also the Council for the Environment of Lukas Plachj.
Both social democrats then know who really is Voldemort, and Lukas Plachem is familiar with where to find this figure - the meaning of the term "to go to the sugarhouse".
"I mean, it means to go to some Prague business," is the Shy close to the divorce that it is about the village of Janoushk's companies.
Accordingly, the Bible reminds him that he had learned more than from the newspapers than to use such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to test frequencies, there is no similar slang dictionary.
"I've been consulting with my colleagues, but it looks like we really don't have anything like that."
"We say more names, sometimes shorts and commony names are used," said the President of the Prague Chairman, Peter Hulinski, whom strangers named Huld.
"In school I was called Breza, but I don't know if my colleagues are calling me that," he admits to his own nickname Karel Brezina.
The journal Currently.ch tested the name and works.
The Council Weinert is for the participants of Grandpa or less friendly Grandpa, the representative Miroslav Poche, who warned himself before the elections of the party's sponsorship, has a name "Gambler" in some colleagues.
The nicknames are also the only thing that social democrats accept in the interior speech.
The Hulinese Huldu is not pleased to hear, but the News.ch noted the other nickname of this Prague President.
"Doctor of the Ocush Law" has been reminding that Peter Hulinski received his title by the Judr. at the Bratislav Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of the witches, issued the brochure
Women declared in Burkina Faso have several common signs.
It belongs rather to an elderly generation, they cannot engage in work for example for health reasons, they are free and no children.
The one that becomes the witch is sent to isolation so that it does not threaten the rest of the village.
"It's a man that fate can only come very rarely."
"Young healthy women are not moving away because they are helping at work and bearing children," describes a regular sister who in the capital of the West African state Burkina Faso ages in a special house for more than a hundred women who have been accompanied by their communities.
The local government has now decided to step against unusual "social measures".
She issued a brochure of information that should help to limit the hunt on the witches.
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," noted Die Standard's journal.
The accusation of the witch is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, who is neighboring with Burkina Faso, last week, the 27th - year - old Ammy Hemmah died after three women and two men tortured her, poured her with petrol and burned.
The BBC server informed the case.
The offenders claim that it was an unfortunate coincidence.
The woman, according to their version, had a oil that was used for ritually anointed.
He said he started after the group wanted to "expel the evil spirit" from a woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports people, regardless of the level of education achieved.
The Der Standard quoted a 22-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "The eaters of human souls always represented the danger," he said.
While the witch hunting in Burkina Faso is trying to be softened by the government, the president himself participated in Gambia in the last year.
"Gambian President Jammi, after his aunt's death, chased a huge hunt on the witches that were supposed to share in her death and try to kill even the president himself."
"He called for help from the nearby Guinea, who, as accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the president's personal security, randomly chosen men and women from the Gambian villages to the President's farm in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in her report.
In the farm, people had to drink a pig from herbs with halucination effects, which also caused abdominal and kidney problems.
Two prisons didn't survive the farm.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were released.
Bakal's mercenary: He's melting in stones, he signed a higher rent
A senior subsadient man steped from the doors of the RPG customer's center of the RPG Apartments "uhlobarona" Zdenka Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in Czech Republic.
Under his arm, he carried a file and in it a new rental contract for three apartments: his daughter, and his son, who is in the punishment.
All three have just rented the deregulation.
Instead of 3500 per month, the son will pay for the apartment 2+1 second category 4100 crowns from the next year.
"And there is no warm water, and it must be drowned with petrame (stone for solid fuel, recognized red)," the man shows with his finger in the son's new treaty, for which the signature is full of power.
"But I signed it," explains half angry and half resigned.
The Civil Association BytyOKD.cz, which has identified new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral", advises the recipients not to sign and wait until 7 December to publish the instructions on how to proceed against them.
But the man's just waving his hand over it.
"One says it, the other thing," it clouds.
Ostravsko becomes a large lab of deregulation.
After the New Year awaits a large majority of apartments in the Czech Republic that have yet unmarket rent.
Currently.ch therefore decided to visit the "lab" in person.
The RPG Havirski waiting room is one of the four in Ostravska and on Tuesday at 9 a.m. is already full.
Right next to the door, there's a security security security security security security guard, and she's got a calling device.
"Lent 2011", lights a special button on his touch display.
One knock, and the machine leaves a number paper.
You can't even read "157" and your number is already on the big display under the ceiling of the waiting room.
You're on your turn in half second.
After a moment, a senior couple is rented to ask, but the inflammation in the waiting room apparently does not affect new rents.
Most people have come to deal with common problems like other times - repair requests, insurance events, and so on.
Letters with new rental contracts are received in Ostravska in mailboxes mostly from 44,000 RPG portfolio apartments, approximately half November.
The RPG Apartments suggest an increase in rent by 15 to 38 per cent in their letters.
The special crossing for new rents was opened on the customer center on November 18th.
"It runs over a week, so it's only in the race," the employees respond after a moment of hesitation when the client presents himself as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakalo's former mining apartments are locally exciting theme.
Before the elections, the Vice-President of Parliament and the island family Lubomir Zaoralek of the CSSD, and even now it is full of local newspapers.
"Twenty years after them, I want a new floor."
"I don't have a board on my toilet," relieved the men mentioned in the introduction.
Most of all, according to the employees, retirees are coming to see if they get a discount from rent, if they sign in time, as the RPG promises in a special offer.
Half-level discount for February rent will also be received by other mercenaries who will sign the new contract by 15 December.
The Havir's "deregulation" crossing, but the questions are definitely not swallowed.
"Of yesterday, 360 clients here for the 2011 rent were only about 40 to 50 people," estimates workers behind the skills.
The RPG, while on the web and its walls, proposes individual negotiations where it is necessary.
However, if both parties do not agree on the rent, it will have to be determined by the independent court.
"It is not about threats, it is information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," RPG notes on its pages.
"No one will judge here," thinks one of RPG employees of the apartment and a man on the street in front of the client center partly gives her for the truth.
"I have 13,000 retirements and I have five thousand left for food, I have not to judge," he says.
The employee, though, is just a little embarrassed.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorlec tells them in the media not to sign, so people probably wait," he thinks.
The rental regulation ends in the majority of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and, according to the RPG Apartment, their economic need is increased.
"The existing rental still does not reach the necessity for the free maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Paul Klimesh, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Apartment, that just an angry mercenary is the main reason for rental.
While for five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG could have invested four billion in apartments, for four years from 2011 to 2014 it should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging at the ceiling across the pustered seats of the hallhouse has yet repeated several redly highlighted information.
"Increased rental in 2011 by 15% and less approximately 31,200 apartments, is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be at the maximum of 7.50 cm per square and a month," it appears on the screen.
Only in 400 apartments from RPG portfolio rental will be increased by 38 per cent.
"In these cases, it is an increase from extremely low amount of 19,66 Kč per square meter," RPG notes.
In 2600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Apartments promise that the deregulation will not rent jump, but will be distributed within four to eight years.
Furthermore, it adds a further commitment: all money from rental rent (see graph) gives the company back to apartments, mainly to warm savings - new windows and warming.
It is preferable for people to sign an increase in rental agreement.
The offices also belong to an architect, understood by the architects
The Administrative Building Avriopoint in Brno is the new residence of Arch.Design.
No one would expect to hide a mini-school with everything that belongs to it - with color walls, designed furniture, a bunch of toys and even a miniature field on the outside terrace.
Since October last year, she may be visited by the children of Arch Design employees.
The projective and architectural company Arch.Design, whose athleries have risen from a number of important bronze buildings, was counting with space for her company mini-school since the first graphs of the Avriopoint building.
Because she employed almost 90 people mostly at the age of a babyboom and cared for women designers and architects to get back to work quickly.
Together with the possibility of short jobs, the school is the benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees within the social programme.
The builders and architects are thus able to settle hard work with childcare.
The mini-school was designed by the Arch.Design employees, and with the support of leadership, they managed to obtain the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company mini-school is financed from the funds of the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme of the Human Resource and Employment and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant funding (a grant of 2,8 million CZK) they could buy equipment and equipment and provide qualified staff and operation for two years.
After the exhaustion of the financial grant (2 years) Arch.Design has a duty to operate a mini-school for 3 years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and with a submission request, the Economy Rating was significantly helping.
The care is provided by a qualified personnel, the nurse and the teacher of MS care for children every day, so children can go to the school without an age limit, but most of them are three years older.
Because it's a mini-collo, there can be only five children at the same time, but there's more of them in the day.
The operation of the school is flexible at the needs of parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the school, regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although it is individual education and care, the mini-school programming is comparable with the pre-school programme.
Children don't only play here but also have quality learning - from basic recognition until after preparing to school clubs, they learn English.
The class is equipped not only with toys, incentive games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and drop stress situations with the delayed pickup of children from schools away from their parents' workplace.
Parents use more productive working hours.
No wonder there is a natural loyal relationship between employees and employer.
Arch.Design has thus joined Czech companies offering significant benefits in the recruitment of new employees are friendly to the family and through this programme has strengthened the personal marketing.
The bone house is fascinating even after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of the eggs, the staircase reminds the back of the dinosaur, and the balcony are open with a fish mouth.
This is the house of Casa Batlló in Barcelona from the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi.
From the local houses, he earned his organic shapes a nickname of the Bones House.
Organic forms, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fractions of tiles and mosaic, fasada resembled meek curves everywhere, all this is typical for the secession of Antoni Gaudi.
The frontier of the house plays dream lines, soft colors and textures resembled by nature and animals.
In detailed observation, geometry, rhythm and precisely thoughtful order is seen.
At night, the whole fasada of home recognises even more dramaticly, so that the impression of the brightness of colors is still enhanced.
The guilt and crushing of shapes appears at the same rate in the interior.
The wood in the waves copys window frames, belts, decorative door elements, cocktails and leaves.
The house of Batlló, which stands in the Eixample quarter on the exciting Shopping Street Passeig de Gracia No. 43, came from the 1877 architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
Investor, a rich industrial Joseph Batlló, originally insisted on breaking up the old building and building a new, soon soon accepted Gaudi's idea of unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
Casa Batlló's work house, but Antoni Gaudi didn't propose it himself.
The architect Joseph Maria Jujol cooperated with him.
The decorations for the real estate owner's apartment and the use of a mosaic on the fasada were created on his design board.
A number of other creators and artists worked on the fasada.
The joint work on Casa Batlló's home proposals launched successful cooperation with Jujol with Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the building of Casa Mila's house and the Güell Park, in which the next Gaudi work was included.
From the local houses after completion, he earned his organic forms of the nickname "Home of Bones".
Others began to call it "town house" because of a specific window opening mechanism.
It is also said that at the top of the building, the sword of St. Jiří, the patrona of Catalan, is characterized.
The hidden religious motives also contain other soccer elements of the building.
The Gaudi designed a unique central heating system for his own time, with skills and typical chimneys.
The bizarre may seem their forty-fifth degree slope.
In the creation of Gaudi, he absolutely disrespected the construction regulations of that time and did not allow him to be bound by them.
At the beginning of the construction, he received a construction permit from the city, however, the data on the planned restructuring were so vague that two years later, when the city's completion was incorporated and requested repair.
For example, the council was disturbed by the fact that the building involved the pillars in the public hallway.
On the contrary, it never occurred to repair: only 15 days after the challenge of the city part, Josep Batlló requested (and successfully) permission to rent two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery in the second floor, there was a social salon and in the third floor of the bedroom and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented by a jewelry.
The entire six - floor house cuts the stairs that can climb up to the roof terrace itself.
The main elements of the restructuring were the cancellation of all the right corners and direct lines and their replacement by the walls of curved.
Gaudi also worked with a modern concept of connecting space.
The social part can be fully connected by the opening of salon doors and a larger company can communicate comfortably without maintaining privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house from Gaudi’s restructuring was also acquired with a new fasada untraditional covering and two additional floors.
It is also impressive of Gaudi's game with light, blue and white glazed tiles, which are covered by the inner court, and lamps.
The game of two colors provides maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was just to bet the principle that the white reflects the light more than the dark, which contraryly swallows the sunlight.
The house of Casa Batlló, which was included in the World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by everyone.
In the first floor of the house, the most universe and most honorable apartment is available to the public.
The owners decided for this step until 2002, at the opportunity to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the celebrating of the famous Creator.
They continued to search because they found that it was a very advantageous business and also extended searches on common and undercover spaces, including roof terrace.
Incoming in the memory is definitely not negligible, it is 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have 20 per cent discount.
Suma significantly exceeds the price of entry into other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the right atmosphere of the house with the dragon towers, you must quickly companion with one of the inhabitants of the gin and visit it directly at home.
How to choose mattress and roast: Women have different requirements than men
Never a honourable bed frame, but the quality of the lying surface, which is mattress and roast, gives the foundation a really good bed.
However, it must be harmoniously supplemented in order to meet the specific user.
When choosing, many things, from weight, height, age, health, and sex of the owner.
It is also important for the type of interior in which mattress and peanuts are acquired.
Typical example?
For example, the weekends where they don't melt regularly are not suitable latex mattress, because they're slower to warm up.
Furthermore, they have significantly higher weight than standard polyuretan mattress.
However, it is necessary to rotate regularly.
If there are no lots of air canals in the core and are still lying on a solid board, they keep moisture: It could also appear under them.
It also decides the custom when choosing.
Who has spent a long time in abroad, where many high mattress are often used with a soft layer, it will hardly feel well at low and hard surface.
"Maybe all the hockeyists who came back from NHL complained to me that they didn't sleep here."
"To their unlocked shoulders, pats and sides, they needed mattress softening with a layer of lazy pen."
"They are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they misconcept "information" from the bonds and skin," explains Sylva Hadamkik, who specializes in the mebels.
Many hockeyists, but also other customers, she was looking for a mattress with a lion.
"It's all right today, a suitable mattress like Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be a NHL fighter to appreciate the lazy pen.
This "master" works simplely.
It optimizes its gravity and shape according to the absorbed heat, or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing pushs you, you won't turn around at night like after a hard fight.
You just get better sleep.
The lion foam also works as protection from the leathers.
When selecting the size of the mattress to your height, add the length of the footstep, which is approximately 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm in a double, thus 180 cm.
For separate beds, for example in singlists, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For comfort and possible visit.
"In other ways, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when you lay on your back, you should have your hands comfortably slightly crushed in the elbows," says Ing. Helena Prokopová, the empire of the characteristics of the masters and decoraters, which have been devoted to healthy sleep and ergonomy of furniture for a number of years and preaching it in professional schools.
In a double bed, each own roast and mattress needs, but here is an eye on the shopping to dilute the heights of the mattress.
Otherwise, there will be nothing but mounting roasts into different heights, but you must not succeed in each frame of bed.
Penny mattress should have at least 14 cm height, types with a railway oven at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on the shape and syringe layer.
"When you touch your hands or sit on the mattress, you must definitely not smell the barriers," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of barbecue.
The whole bed, when the mattress and the foundation are like a grown Siam twin, has nothing to do in beds.
The mattress are broken wrong, they can't be washed, which is now common.
And since we usually sweat 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat in the night, it is clear that after five to seven years of mattress, one big (and stiff) network will be reminded of.
Therefore, experts refuse advertising logs about mattress life for up to 25 years, or even for life guarantees.
But everything has its own.
Therefore, the advice from sellers: in mattress wide 120 or 140 cm hygiene and work sensitive voltage, do not give up, but add a mattress protector that you can easily remove and wash.
Even if the mattress are usually produced today, we have been scattered all over the circle, so we get two parts (for washing and washing size very important!), however, manipulation in larger types (and in one person) when taking a picture to remind the fight of light weights in the ring with difficulty.
Do you have a solid board in your bed?
Never!
Maximum for bed for visits for one night.
However, the board (if it is no longer available) shall be carried out with wind holes and use a mattress with a barley and a height of at least 15 cm, with baskets in bags (with it.Taschenfederkern) and a kissing layer.
Polyuretan mattress does not belong to such a basis.
For non-looking lamel barrels with 14 to 18 lamels, suitable latex or sandwich mattress (needing the combination of latex and coconut), but you will always be paid with a large number of lamels, 28 and more where the lameles in the area of the beder are doubled and their tension can be regulated.
Locator lamel bars do not belong to mattress with a railway oven, because they do not react to the position.
In addition to lamel lamel settings, you can also have a so-called shoulder wheel.
It's a special lamel capture, which allows to push or even slope the lamele so that the bed shoulder gets pretty "built."
For men who have "arms over their back", it's definitely important.
Even mattress producers who started using the mitigation zone right in the area of the shoulders are remembering it.
They also remember women - they're getting softer surfaces in the places of the bulbs.
For the most difficult customers, wings or desticks are designed with so-called multiterranean pearing.
Pressure is dissolved into several points and reduces the voltage.
Of course, once you use the right mattress and the grown bad pillow (great and "narrowed"), the majority of "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow is to support his head and tops only to the shoulders so that the shoulders can be released.
As appropriate size, 50 x 60 cm is recommended, for example, in Scandinavia.
When laying on the side, the pillow should be tackled (including the shoulder with the bark or the soft area in the mattress) the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattress have only something in common with the original slams filled with grass.
Because their manufacturers are increasingly used by natural materials or at least in front of them.
Trend was just in the mattress.
Oil raw materials made of polyuretan pens are replaced by natural oils, such as junk and soy.
The soy may be used by all known producers.
"Byo in mattress means that the core is made from the material of clean natural origin," explains Peter Vaseček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress, one of the first was aloe faith.
But you can also enjoy the microcaps to relax your fresh smell of forest or leandula.
There's also a division for men and women.
While a man "colds" a plant extract from the breast to absorb the mattress heat and cold the body, women in the opposite heating.
The extract from red peppers increases the circulation of blood, so it's a weaker gender warmer.
Today's favorites?
The matrace made of cold pen (mainer pores with a disturbed cell structure, is as far as normal polyuretan and offers better flexibility.
The combination of various cold pens and lion pens forms multi-zone mattress that know exactly where the head, bees and pats are supposed to be.
You'll pay for quality mattress from seven thousand crowns and upwards.
Those who meet health parameters have a lower VAT rate are gathered as medical devices.
He first reached in the Czech Republic on this advantage of Gumotex.
Watching the mattress and the barn is not easy.
Sometimes, for example, the actions of manufacturers or sellers offering two mattress at the price of one.
For example, Magniflex offers Duofreeze's mattress with all the memorial sing of Memory for 11,990 crowns.
But the other one can be ordered for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastical pens with open cell structure and high density launched the "cosmic" pace of the Tempur material.
It was originally a material for NASA because the astronauts were exposed to an enormous overload.
Temperature in warmness is soft, and in the cold, it's reinforcing.
The warm human body is so perfectly adapted and optimally distributed to its pressure.
It is therefore ideal against the emergence of leagues, but also to increase the comfort of sleeping.
Viscoelastic pens are used not only for mattress but also for health products, such as special pillows under the legs that distract legs and veins.
For example, local producers use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver pen and similarly.
The tools for monitoring people want more parents, so they want to custody their children.
The fear of your own child brings more people to the mind of watching through the GPS.
The originally created system for car search may also monitor the movement of people, such as the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatka.
The device's about as big as a box of cheese, but soon it can only be as big as an hour.
A number of people frightened the case of the disappeared Anice, and they began to piss around the means of protecting their children better.
Even at the price of disruption of their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that it is not any spying, but another means to reduce the probability that there will be some tragedy," said Peter Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices to the Czech market.
"I assume, in a certain case, there may be abuse of such devices, such as when they are put in a bag of someone who doesn't know about it, but we haven't met a case like that yet."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know what the purpose of the box is and how it is used in case of emergency.
The child’s psychologist Dana Botchek notes that if the child doesn't want to wear anything like that, he'll just get rid of it.
"I have very little children show great creativeness in how to lose some things on purpose if they don't want to be under control."
"The great expectations have previously caused mobile phones in parents, however, which can be excluded as well as this tracking device," said Botchkov.
It also suggests that it would really help in the event of the attack.
"When the kidnapping is ready, the perpetrators will be able to make sure that the child doesn't have any electronic that could give up his location."
"Now it's a phone."
"When the tracking devices are expanded, they will also look for them, because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In that case, criminals will always be a step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, he admits that similar devices can help in the event of an unexpected attack by pedophiles.
According to Robert Čech from RC Monitoring, who offers monitoring services both for cars and for persons, even when it comes to an immediate destruction of the tracking device, his presence can help.
"The device can be configured for regular dispatch of the position after a certain period of time."
"If there is a damage, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"The expensive devices have also klonometers built, so even if a person slide and stays still lieing, he will send a warning immediately with the position," says Czech Republic.
He believes that a similar service can also lead smart mobile phones with navigation, where the special software can be loaded.
The problem of current tracking units is either the devices similar to the size of a box of cheese or smaller mobile phones.
Their loss is always so threatened.
According to Pilin from Macro Weil, it is now tested as a typical digital clock.
"It will have the greatest advantage in the fact that a possible aggressor does not have to know the tracking device at all."
"Well, he will know them until after a while, and that can give the police more time," he adds.
Whether the surveillance devices are developed into bracelets or trailers, they will still use the same technology as it is used to watch cars.
It is a combination of detecting the location through the GPS system (which uses normal autonavigation) and the function of the mobile phone which the current position of the vehicle is reporting.
The army has a warm rope to wrap the Czech Republic, but it only lasts two years.
The Czech army bought 445 miles of ropes that fire the cracks.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence added 224 miles of ropes to the warehouse.
This is how the army has supplies for 225 years.
The problem is that the duration of the rope is two, maximumly four years.
The army bought the fuel ropes from the STV Group stock, and, s. 40 million crowns.
The general headquarters in the reasons for the purchase of such an enormous amount of inflammation chains MF DNES reported that soldiers consume 60 miles of lighting a year in training.
However, from the numbers of military pyrotechnics that the MF DNES addressed, it shows that there would then have been a very intense pyrotechnic training that would have to be conducted annually by all the generals, officers of the army, secretary or cleaning officers.
The Minister of Defense, Alexandr Vondru and the Army Commander, Vlastimil Pick, aren't exposed.
It's the only way to justify the annual consumption of the army of 60 miles of lighting.
This length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was, the army stock would have enough for more than ten years.
On the contrary, if it would apply that the basic training of each new professional is sufficient to at least two meters of the fuel chain, as the experts say, so the army has provided fresh purchases - and with increased consumption of women or special units - supplies for those 225 years.
Soldiers of the Brigade of Quick Weapons have recently complained to Minister Vondrove that they have almost no bullets in hand weapons, so the guns are limited because of the need for money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't even think they're buying a lot of lighters from us again and again."
"But it's their decision, and they know what they're going to do."
"For us, the army is a good customer that we are trying to meet as businessmen," said SV Group Manager Jan Kidski.
The speaker of the Ministry of Defence, Jan Pejšek, causes hundreds of miles of shopping ropes, even by having the army's supplies of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Children of the STV Group only speaks of the four-year life of the fuel and police or military pyrotechnic, even two years.
"In the perfect storage, it may also be those four," said one of them, who like a soldier because of the criticism of the army does not want to publish the name.
After life has passed, each ammunition must be carefully tested whether it is still reliable and threatens soldiers in life.
However, these tests are not free and costs more money.
Another argument of the Ministry is the quantitative discount of 445 miles of fuel ropes.
"It cost us sixty percent less than last year's supplies two hundred and forty-five miles," translates Pejšek's opinion of the Shopping Department of Defence.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of fire ropes of police pyrotechnics that eliminate the ammunition from World War II or after the Soviet army has not exceeded 1500 meters for several years.
And the police always order the quantity to consume this ammunition before life goes away.
It has proved to her for the safety of pyrotechnics, and it can also gain more flexiblely, and thus more reliable types of ropes.
The Ministry of Defence has already had significant problems with the elimination of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty, when the 20,000 Czechoslovakian army was preparing for Ryn.
The Czech according to the Pyrotechnics MF DNES addressed a few years later, the same problem is: it will eliminate hundreds of miles of old burns that "latino" buys today.
Still, I'm drawing from contacts that I've gained by the competition
The victory site in the year's Furniture has helped Lucas Pytlon to sell his hotel franchise.
The winner of the last year's Competition Furniture of the year became an eighty-year-old entrepreneur Lukas Pitloun from Liberia.
His story of success is like a movie.
Luke Pytloun liked to travel.
And in a foreign place, he realized that in Liberca there was no quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
He bought a semi-divorced house with five apartments from foreign brigs and a bank loan.
That he was still a student of the third high school school at that time, it was a great courage.
"The current ratio between quality and the price of accommodation in our place has not been given to me so that I don't try to do anything," Luke Pytloun says.
The first reconstructed apartment started renting foreign workers.
All profits were invested back to the house that gradually converted into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in seven years, he gradually managed to open four pensions in Liberca, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
But this year another, equally quality came to him.
"We have just a signed contract with the hotel in Tissea, where we sold our frenchising concept and other interested in the French of the Pytloun hotels are reported," said last year's farmer number one.
"And this sale of the hotel license was a major part of the winning in the Year's Futurer competition," Pytloun admittedly added.
The victory brought him more knowledge and popularity in Liberca and the surroundings.
"People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me further and I must say that it was pleasant," he recalls.
It definitely recommends participation in the competition to all those who seek something.
It's not even necessary to win, every vision is good.
He says he's still drawing from contacts and acquaintances that he might not get to.
"Some whom I met through the competition, I started to trade regularly."
The glory associated with success according to him affected all the employees.
And that he's got about 70.
"I see more loyalty and pride in them that they are participating in something that has gained universal recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it's the result of the good work of all of us together."
"Only my name is pushed in front," Luke Pytloun said today modestly.
I wish my successor a more calm year than we had in Farmet
The victory eufories quickly addressed the impacts of the crisis.
But because of the victory's goal, Farmet has worse times.
For the price of the first place in the last year of the Vodafone Company's competition, the Slovak house owner of Farmet, Karel Ždžarski, came in the year.
The jury then evaluated the efforts by which he built a company of hundred million arms from a small toolshop in Czech Scaleca.
"I can say that appreciation has encouraged not only me, but all my co-workers and has raised our self-control consciousness," the winner said today last year.
At the beginning of Farmet's history, the desire was to do something useful.
So, when the state offered to the father of Karl Žjarski to rent a small worker as compensation for communist enslaved property, he did not hesitate for a long time, he refused his career in the company where he worked, and with a few friends around his dad founded a company on plastic vans.
Soon, they began specializing in plant oil foxes.
After 18 years, they became the largest producer of automatic lies in Central Europe.
A greater awareness even among the non-professional public has come to the company after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers began to see the Farmet mark significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate their collaboration with the company that has achieved greater success in their country," Karel Ždžarski said.
However, the last year he was not only in the Farmet sign of a victory eufory.
The evaluation was based on the economic results of the company until 2008 and only partly from 2009.
And just 2009 was the hardest year to sell machinery goods.
The top of the crisis that has not touched citizens so much, but companies have already stopped their investment projects and began to limit purchases of new machines and technology.
"That situation, of course, did not avoid us either."
"The sales dropped by 40 percent, we had to limit production and have been released," explained Karel Ždžarski.
Life-capable company must know how to make such unpopular measures sometimes.
But they managed and kept the company profitable, even though less than before the crisis.
However, what they did not discount in the Farmet is investment in research and development.
"We have built research and training centres from funds, strengthened presentation on international ventures, gained primary appreciation in home exhibitions," Ždžárski said.
It all suggests that the crisis is over them.
The markets are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant sense of victory, but in a more calm atmosphere," Karel Ždžárski tells.
A survey that removes nonsensitive provisions
The year Absurdit survey is a fourth part of the business qualification.
Some nonsensitive provisions have already been cancelled.
An unfamous winner of the next year of the Absurdity year's surveillance has become obliged to carry documents to the office, which are also available to officials online.
She decided more than a third of less than four thousand voters.
For example, the management of social security required a paper exit from the commercial register, even though the official could obtain it with two clicks of the mouse.
The survey will change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will not require exemption from the trading register for checks in the insurance plates," said the spokesman of the Czech Republic, Jana Burañ.
Introducing all the rules and regulations that companies and businesses in Czech Republic must fulfil, and those impregnatively canceling them by the meaning of the Absurdity of the year.
This is the fourth part of the business pushing of the economic newspapers and the public is increasingly familiar.
If about three thousand voters participated in the loon, there were almost four thousand votes this year.
And no wonder, the various legal obligations that serve only to delay business is still enough for us.
"E.g. in the number of leasters for tax recognition we are in the front places of the world," Karel Havliček of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Animals of the CRC notes.
The simplification of business has become an advertising goal for all governments in recent years.
However, in comparison with the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improved.
According to the World Bank, Czech Republic, in terms of business conditions, has located at 74th position, which is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the year was first announced in 2006 and is held annually according to the same scenario.
Administrative and bureaucratic nonsense can be signed by anyone each year from April to the end of September when the competitiveness is concluded.
For login, the web address is www.firmaroku.cz Then the competitor chooses seven candidates to "anticen" and allows the public to vote for it during October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.internet.cz.
Absurdity that gets the most votes winning.
More than a hundred, more than 105 of the rules and regulations have been reported to the survey this year.
The tips were sent by businessmen, but also professional unions and journalists.
Among the "finalists" competition, for example, the requirement between nominated cars for road maintenance and rapid roads is to pay mine, or businessmen with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets to draw every two years.
The list of this year's seven proposals is published on the page of the competition.
The announcement of the competition that is always in the beginning of November at the Václava Square in Prague is part of the hapening that regularly participates in the personality of political and social life.
For example, this year, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium Business and Animals of the Czech Republic, or Peter Kugel, President of the Economic Chamber of the Czech Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot work where the state is throwing a stick to businessmen under my feet, so my goal is to cancel at least three dozens of paragraphs, which are just complicating business today," said the Minister of Industry and Trade, Martin Kocourek.
Attention to interrupt nonsense regulations does not recognise in vain.
In 2007, the responsibility of the entrepreneur was to report three days ahead to the animal office in the place where the permanent operational office is located, the intention of traveling with an exhibition or leaflet.
This obligation has been removed from the new animal law.
The second most voting obligation in 2007, which was notified to the Office of Work as its foreign employee as a period of up to 30 days, was removed by the law on so-called green card.
And to the third of all good.
In absurdit 2009, the physiotherapeuts had a large mirror, a refrigerator and two weights in the office.
This was mitigated this year by the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have a refrigerator wasted.
New categories appreciates socially responsible companies
The value of environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects.
This year's fifth year's competition of Economic newspapers is a category called the 2010 Responsible Company.
The mission of this competition is to support reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take account of their environmental impacts and support socially responsible activities," said Patrick Bartholdy, regional mobile operator manager, Vodafone, who is the proclaimer and the guarantee of competition, as well as the year's rebel competition.
For this year's first year of this special subcategory of the Vodafone Company in 2010, companies not successful in business with the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would issue a separate article.
Although the subject of its activity is diameterally different, the common denominators of their efforts may be regarded as support and respect.
In one case, for example, it concerns persons with disabilities and, in other cases, personal problems or health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen full-republic finalists, for example, the Prague Et Netera Software Company, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of the responsible company from the Pardubian region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been a major contribution to the Fund for Disabilities for Seventeen years.
On her health disagreement employees, the old paper from the Popiebrads, which has over 70 percent, he therefore obtained the title of the Mediterranean Company's Responsible Company and, in the Voafone Company of the year, placed in the area as a third.
In Olomouck, the accounting company MiRyz Soft, which introduced an flexible working period, also declined to the average of 35 hours a week but without a moderate reduced salary.
The jury also gave her the title for the preferred purchase from Czech producers, supporting civil activities in the neighbourhood and protecting the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible to make our business and our administration have as low environmental impacts," explains Director Miluša Ryznar.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ustec region again thinks of the health of its employees and has given them ergonomic chairs and keyboards, supports their work from home and uses the catering services provided by the locally protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the Fundation of Man in Distress, which helps specifically the local Roman community," said the representative of the company Ondrej Suchi.
In addition, the activity of the Washing and Cleaning company from the Karlovar County, which contributes to their pension insurance for its employees in the form of superstandard bonuss.
"Again, we give contributions to food, transport, qualification and recreation," says Joseph Strapač from the bruntal construction company Time, winner in the Morausles County.
The Category of the Year's Responsible Company was automatically registered by all the finalists in the region of the Vodafone Company of the year who answered questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the latest by 15 August.
Incorrectly filled or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were then deleted by the orderer from the evaluation.
"If the competitive companies did not answer the questions, the competition Responsible Company could not attend the year but are not disqualified from the "the main" competition of the Vodafone Firm of the year."
"The single login is not possible only for this competition, because it is a subcategory of the main competition of the Company of the year," explains Karel Goldman from Bison & Rose's redeployment agency.
At the Land Fund in Plzni, the police were arrested at the public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Plzni last days, an anti-corruption police was arrested.
Detectives planted a local businessman in the media sphere and a real estate trader Luboshi G.
He was allegedly trying to manipulate the public competition for the settlement of restitution rights so that the land offered in the competition won a specific interester.
He was supposed to pay half a million crowns for it.
"I can now just confirm that the police are pursuing one person for a violation of the pletix in the public order and in public competition," Antonie Greena said the Law of the Chief of the Plenny State Representativeship, with further details in view of the ongoing investigation cannot be provided.
Sixty-five-year-old cops were released after 24 hours.
In view of the minimum official information, how he could have influenced the public competition, it can only be speculated.
The speaker of the Land Fund of Lubomir Black on the question The Law stated that the police were really arrested during the public competition at the disconnected workplace in Plzni.
"It was a client, not our employee," she said.
The public competition has the right name, according to Montenegro, "Call to submit an offer for land transfer according to the law of the land" and shall be conducted when more authorised applicants are interested in the offered land.
"These persons in the context of the challenge offer higher value of their restitution rights to be arranged by transfer than the value of the land was declared."
"On the basis of the claims offered, the order of buyers is set, and the Land Fund will then translate the land to the person who offered the highest privileges," the speaker of the Fund explained.
Apparently, Luboš G. had information that had been applied to the challenge, and since he was also an authorized person, since he bought a number of restitutional rights, he offered to the stakeholders that the competition would not attend.
He must have incassed the retreat for it.
That would explain that he had so much money in detention.
Luboš G. had overstanding contacts on PF in Plzni in the past.
In the case of the former chief of PF Václav Sankota, who was criminally persecuted for issuing in the replacement restitution of the land that has already been issued.
At that time, Luboš G. received from the Fund lands designed to build public communications, specifically in the place where the arrival magistral was to be built into the Borská field industrial zone.
Later, he changed them with a magistrate at the house in the historic center of the city, which was much higher.
At that time, the city must have joined it, because otherwise it would endanger the building by blocking the land.
Housing households applies hundreds per month
The households will have to be added not only for all types of energy since January, but also for water and sailing, heat supply and somewhere growing.
Thus, families will have to draw from the wallets from January to hundreds of crowns a month more than now.
The electricity will be blown up by 4.6%, the gas will be approximately 2% more expensive, until you will have to applaud a tenth in some cities for water supply and a lot of inflammation of central heat supplies.
Energy exhaustion should be exhausted at homes a year more than now.
The prices of power electricity, while all the main suppliers decreased, there is therefore a significant increase in support for energy production from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaics.
Although the gas will be mild, however, at the time when people are the most drowning and they have the highest consumption.
Therefore, it must also count with hundreds of additional crowns per year.
While electricity and gas betray all over the Republic, the change in central heating prices is different from the place.
Price increases are planned mainly for larger citizens.
For example, households in Pardubica or Castle Kings will pay for central heating by about 50 crowns a month, more than 1,000 crowns per year in Liberca.
The inhabitants of Prague are also threatened that more than 9 percent of them will be betrayed by water and vineyards in case the city increases the rental from the infrastructure.
If the rental doesn't change, the Emptied 6.8% will be added.
However, the price in Prague will still belong to a full republic comparison between the lower.
In the northern Czech Republic, where prices already belong among the highest, has a water and storage impression by 7.4%.
For example, the rental prices of 450 thousand rental apartments can rise explicitly, where regulations have been completed since January.
For example, the CPI Apartment, which owns about 2500 apartments in Usto over Labe, will increase up to 100 per cent since January.
Those who won't agree with the new rent will give the company to court.
The regulated rents paid by people in approximately 300 000 apartments could increase by 10 per cent next year.
Czech children drink with fernet and rum. Beer is from fashion, works slowly.
Fernet, rum, vodka, specially and better whiskey tag stolen from your parents.
These are drinks, after which drinking ends mostly in the care of doctors, a drunk who has not even been 15 years old.
Exception is not children treated by monkeys repeatedly in the hospital.
This comes from experiences of doctors who face similar cases at the income of the hospital childhood.
"Some beer or wine are totally unfashioned, because it takes a long time to get drunk with them."
"Trendem is definitely a hard alcohol," said the Right Prime Minister of the Child Division of Hořowice in the Middle Czechs Ludek Pelikan.
"When they can pull a bottle from the closet to their dad, it's like whiskey, otherwise it's controlled by fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage of pouring her into juice and then it's not so much to feel," the prime minister explained.
And for the truth, the speaker of the Faculty Hospital, Motol Eva Jurin.
"It's a fernet or a rum at all."
"This is modern alcohol today, especially in basic schools."
"In some cases, it was a squirrel they brought from home," said Jurin.
According to Pelican, 13 or 14-year-old drunks in hospital income are relatively common.
Before Horovice, where he has been working since this year, he has worked for ten years on a pediatrician in Motole, where the ambulances are bound by the high school students from the wide area.
"One girl lied with us about four times."
"The career started at the age of twelve, when it was brought to us with 3.5 miles of alcohol in blood in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the Hollishovic exhibition at a dance party."
"It's interesting that her mother didn't even come out that she didn't know about her daughter 48 hours," the prime minister looked.
The concern of parents or even their significant tolerance to drink their own descendants is considered the main cause of growing child drunkenness.
However, the dependence in the right word of meaning cannot be spoken by experts in children.
"The alcoholic means several years of chronic dependence on alcohol with all the phenomenons that belong to it, and it's not in children."
"In those who are taking alcohol repeatedly, there is rather an unfamiliar family-social background," explained Prime Minister Pelican.
According to speaker Jurina this year, they were hospitalized by about 40 drunk children in Motole’s paediatric clinic until half November.
However, only those with severe inxication that had to remain in the hospital will get to the statistics.
Children's drunks that parents take after the ambulance, if possible the police are transporting them home, they are not counted.
Except when children sit after school and drink a bottle of corn, there are three seasonal shifts that can be relyed on: witches, Silvester and the end of the school year.
"It's either the grief of the wrong testimony, or they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"Of course, I experienced seven children's drunks at the edge of the witch," said Pelican.
A drunker who spends the night detoxication under the doctor's care is paradoxically in the benefit of the other day who suffers an unpleasant fever at home.
The morning headache caused by dehydration and glucose deficiencies will cause an infusion with glucose and nutrition that lacks organism.
"They're actually better at this because they have a beautiful night experience and awakening and nothing hurts."
"They are only confused about where they are," Pelican admitted, while sometimes he would ruin the patient's pleasant mood at least by counting the costs that their treatment demanded.
The transport of ambulance and hospitalization on the acute bed will also come to dozens of thousands of crowns.
"I used it sometimes as a curriculum when I calculated on the visit to those children how much their drunkness was worth and that they could also spend the whole summer on the Brigade to make money for one party," Pelican added.
However, he believes that health insurance is not accessible to regressive procedures in which parents would take care of the treatment costs in the case of children’s drinkers.
Two flights L-159 are first in foreign hands in Spain
Two flights L-159 of the total five pieces, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M, flew to Spanish Sevilla on Tuesday, where the manufacturer of Casa - EADS was located.
It's the first time the machines of this type have appeared in possession of someone other than the Czech army.
They've only been in practices or showing years in a foreign place.
It's a two-local version of L-159T1, which the Czech army has already operated and which were flying.
The remaining three machines are single L-159.
These are still reserved in Aero Waterways and the trade mediator - the Omnipol company - took them over last week.
When the flights are physically exploited from the Waterway, it is not known by Jan Peisk from the press committee of defence.
"The single flights L-159 for shift were excluded from long-term aircraft, without further contributions and investments from the ministry's resort."
"Double L-159T1 has been changed in current state and form," said the Law of Peys.
He added that the army would not remain without double aircraft because the Ministry signed a contract of 200 million crowns for the restructuring of four unnecessary machines L-159 to two two two-place machines in May 2009.
One new plane took over the army in July, the other takes over by the end of this year.
According to Peysk, EADS was committed to put the aircraft into the arms of some alliance country.
"The contract clearly states that the aviation beneficiary of L-159 is EADS and will serve for the training of pilots from NATO countries."
"There is therefore the recipient's things how this thing will be realized," said Peisek.
The economic papers reported earlier that, for example, the Spanish Army of L-159 is not interested in it.
The exchange of five L-159 for one Casa flight and the purchase of other three planes for 3.5 billion crowns approved last year by the Government of Mirk Topolanka.
The Ministry of Defence did not write for the purchase of the selection procedure and addressed the EADS directly.
The former defence leadership was proposing that the exchange would support the future exports of L-159 to abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aero and only uses 24, the rest would want to sell.
Casa's shopping planes will probably have a judicial match.
The European Commission has sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in the European Court because it should have chosen aircraft on the basis of a full-European tend, not by a single producer.
The army has already taken over three Casa flights, the last one should be at the Kbela Prague airport in 14 days.
A longer indicator than a ring means a lower risk of cancer
Men who have a indicator longer than a ring are at a smaller risk of disease with cancer of prostate.
This is a surprising conclusion of the study published by the British Cancer Journal on Wednesday.
It can be connected to the level of the male testosterone hormone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of the risk of cancer of prostate, especially for men under 60 years," Ros Eeles, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help determine which men should be subjected to the cancer test of prostate, especially in combination with genetic risk or other hazardous factors such as family health burden, added Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, she monitored more than 1500 patients with cancer of prostate and concomitantly over three thousand healthy men with colleagues in Britain.
More than half of the participants of the study had a right hand indicator shorter than a ring.
The same probability of cancer of prostate was paid for them as for 19 percent of those whose fingers were as long as long.
In the case of those who had a indicator longer than the ring, however, this risk dropped by 33 percent, and even 87 percent declined for men to the 60s.
The ratio of the length of two mentioned fingers - formed in the prenatal period - apparently reflects the different levels of gender hormones whose child is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer indicator.
Previous studies have shown that the testosteron is just supporting the growing cancer of prostate.
The leading Czech genetic and former Academy of Sciences Professor Václav Paches for CTK said that he knew about this study, but he didn't seem to know that the relationship between the length of fingers and cancer was "completely proven".
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered by snow on Thursday morning.
The roads and the walkers are mostly lying in snow, the roadmans ride in many places all night.
The road D5 is closed in the morning between 89. and 93. mile in the direction of Rozvadov due to several car and personal car accidents and also stands D1 in the direction of Brna in Prague.
The newsman told the central car club dispatcher (UAMK).
The truck crashed at 91 miles [91 km], two cars crashed at 93 miles [93 km], and the accident demanded injury.
A number of personal cars also ended in the jam.
Problems are also on the D1 highway to 185 miles in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks crashed there.
The drivers should ride right after Brn on 190 miles or ride over Brno and then travel to 182 miles [182. km] on the Kyvalca.
There are several kilometer columns.
There's also an accident on the D11 highway, and it's right at the arrival to Prague.
In Prague, there is a few inches of snow, the temperature shows minus seven degrees of Celsia.
For example, the car columns are created on the average, but also the Sterboholska is stuck.
The most secure transport is the metro.
Tramways, for example, are delayed on the trail between the Karl Square and the Square of Peace.
At 8 a.m., the Prague Crisis Office will be re-settled again.
There are also problems with railways and airports.
The Czech roads have already had to cancel seven rapid compounds because of snow.
For example, he has a trail from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun.
The travellers should check the current situation.
The airport of Ruzyna was closed from the middle 11 hours at night to 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in southern Moravia are already down, but only with increased caution.
There are three sideways in Wyskovsk, the places are formed in snow languages and in Blanensk are necessary to overcome certain communications in the snow chains located above.
The most disastrous places belonged to Wishkovsko.
So far there are closed roads: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalace - Kučerov, and also Sharatice - Milesovice.
They're going to have to put the frees in their stretches.
When they're passed out, it's not possible to estimate yet.
There is a need for caution in the area of the White Karpat.
The roads that are there for nature protection are only maintained by inertial syringe, as up to 5 centimetrs of snow, said the CTK.
In the Czech Republic, snow was attacked from two to ten centimeters, the most falling in the northern Czech Republic, many to 18 centimeters.
There was about 15 inches of snow in the Moravslesch district.
Snowing in Czech Republic is gradually stopping.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American Army planted a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known only under the XM-25 code mark.
Generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban and "to turn the game" in their favour.
The new weapon is like a small superprecise gun.
Its missiles are put in a laser with a precision of a few meters.
Special bullets of 25 mm, developed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive rifle, actually operate as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed by exploding not only when they hit the target, but at any point of their balistic path.
Hence, it can be used against an enemy who hides behind any obstacle, behind the wall or in the burial.
For the upper is usually not protected, and when a killing rain of steel scratches is carried out on it, it can be removed from the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was participating in the XM-25 development, the new gun is the first weapon for the marine that uses "smart" technology.
"The soldier deals with it in principle by finding a goal, sending a laser ray to it, which determines the distance, so he gets a precise point of intention, according to him, adjusts the intention and pushes the corner."
"Let's say you've measured 543 metres."
"When you press a trigger, the gun will be loaded and fired at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," said Audette.
Move 400 jobs
Fujitsu's concern is moving his office from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July next year from the real administrative building to the Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu concert will move his office from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant in the field in Wednesday, specialized in computers and their maintenance, will move in July 400 men and women of their work place from the original administrative building in Marienbader-Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in the Lyon Street, part of Frankfurt called Nederrad.
According to the statement by the speaker Fujist, there should be further 100 jobs of the concert, which are currently divided in the region.
The rent offer was said to be very attractive and large-space offices in Astro Park said they were more suitable to the working method of employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only rented.
The competent director Bernd Wagner said, "In Frankfurt-Nederrad, we found a central site with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection with the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important enterprise within the region has resulted in joy in the winners yesterday and disappointment in the defeated.
The leading economic referencer in Frankfurt Marcus Frank (CDU) said that this was the result of a "global player".
They say it's a fantastic expression of trust in this place.
Fujitsu is said to be suitable for the city, the accommodation is an important impulse for Nederrad.
Mayor Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Green), regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
He said the city was informed in time by the company's leadership of his intention.
"Certainly we offered our help to the company," said Corwisi.
However, friendship contacts could not change the problem of the manufacturer of computers with an rental on the Marienbader-place.
As a result, economic reasons were decisive.
Now it's about preventing long non-deployment in such an outstanding place.
"I hope the owner and renter of the building will be cooperative."
The house at the Rathaus Square, which has been using Fujitsu so far, and the neighbouring "Kleine Verticale" belonged to ten years ago, along with other buildings on the Marienbader Square for the most disputed construction purposes of the bathroom city.
Among stations and councils, however, a joint project of the city and a private designer of the city's entree, which was criticised for the massive construction of areas that used to serve as a parking area and also for the height of buildings.
In 2001, the company of Feri’s Investment Advisory and Rating, the manufacturer of a software for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the manufacturer of Fujitsu computers, who was still connected to Siemens.
Buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired together in 2006 by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and after a year, Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu-concern from Tokio is marked as the third largest IT-provider in the world.
It offers, for example, computers and servers available and also takes care of the required service.
The branch office in the region of Ryna and Mohanu is one of the largest staff in Germany, but most Fujitsu employees are in Mnichov.
From Bad Homburg, a daughter's company Fujitsu Technology Solutions, other daughters in this area will be Fujitsu Services and TDS.
In the administrative building of Astro Park, 7000 square meters were rented for this purpose.
In the complex - its name points to the star landscape, which is 20 years old, the seats, in addition to other, are also the central union of the electrotechnic and electronic industry.
Amazon shuts off the server - threats against Assangem
Wikileaks gets in tight.
The Amazon Internet Service has disabled the platform for discovery on its servers.
It is possible that it has happened to political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic descriptions.
The founder of Wikileaks Assange is allegedly delayed in Great Britain.
Wikileaks, the discovery platform, is getting under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their real home server in America and are now looking for an online home in Europe.
Meanwhile, the prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and businesses to bouquet Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks Julian Assange, who is guided on the list founded by Interpol, is to stay in accordance with one newspaper contribution in Great Britain.
"Wikileaks is no longer on the Amazon server."
"Free Speak in the Free County," informed activists of the public service of short Twitter messages in the Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Amazon internet company downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists have used the secret diplomatic depeses of Amazon Web Service (AWS) to manage a high number of access to documents.
By using the Twitter service, Wikileaks explained this step: "Fine - our dollars will be spent now by employing people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, "and they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators reportedly performed the investigation, published the CNN television station on the basis of Lieberman's information.
The Chairman of the Home Defence Committee threatened Amazon by boycott, informed the British Guardian.
"I'd wish that Amazon had approached this step earlier, in view of the previous publication of classified information on Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Meanwhile, Lieberman called to prevent the platform from using servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, inadequately and unreasonably, and thus our national security is at risk and threatens life all over the planet," said a non-party senator's statement.
"No responsible company -- either American or foreign -- should help Wikileaks in their efforts to expand the stolen material."
The founder of Wikileaks Assange, who is searched by the Swedish authorities for suspects of rape, is on the list founded by Interpol.
On the basis of the report in the London newspaper The Independent, 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain, Scotland Yard is also aware of the exact place.
The Internet activist always called the investigation in Sweden as an intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks Christinn Graffnsson in London said there were also threats.
"There were even challenges to kill Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is rightly concerned about his safety, said Graffnsson.
Therefore, the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Apparently, Graffnsson responded to the words from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, asked the responsible person for publicising on Wikileaks for treason to be accused and executed.
In Canada, one advisor of the government's government Stephen Harper - apparently ironically, Assange should be "assange" and Obama could use "a whole plane".
Meanwhile, between the White House and Assange, there was a word shooting.
The speaker of the American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "funny and absurd", that Assange asked the Minister of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for the recently published spy challenges to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of one person with websites," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and interests of this country are much more important than its websites."
The American government is now exploring the safety of its databanks.
The special authority was appointed by the Deputy Director of the Centre for Anti-terrorism, Russell Travers, to share the White House.
Travers has become responsible for the development of "necessary reforms in the structure", which are necessary after the publication of reports from the embassy to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review the way the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The American government also announced that he would like to take care of the security of disidents and activists if they were to get in danger for the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have understood everything to contact them," the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Philip Crowley said.
"We're ready to protect them, if it would be necessary."
Icelandic University
The "Gelato University" in Bolonna is preparing ice cream sugars for a better year period.
The basic course for the future freezer, which takes three days, is a great interest and visitors are coming from around the world.
Where's the ice cream actually coming from?
From Gelatier and from Gelataio.
Gelatier, Czech, a little old ice cream, produces cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio will extract ice cream from the cold box, wipe it out and sell it.
To find out, you don't have to ride to Anzol dell'Emilia in Bologna Province.
But whoever wants to know more about ice cream, he won't avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian Carpigiani company.
In 2003, the manufacturer of ice cream machines set up a ice cream university to allow the ice cream from his machines to match all over the high Italian ideals.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is a huge interest and visitors come from around the world.
However, several days of special courses are also offered on chocolate ice cream and practices in their own ice cream.
Someone wishes in their Midlife-Crisis for a new career, others dare to the thin ice of their irritating desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all worlds - from Brazil across Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the Ice-Cream country in future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something own after years of stress.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening a ice cream in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one of Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and a Canadian woman in the house, Julia came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Galatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive is not only a good taste, but also a silk flexibility and a good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during his training for a South and patriotical sauce on the cake: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then it belongs to a noted dose of romance."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic supplies of milk, slipper, milk powder, sugar and stabilizators into a large mixer that heats everything with an electronic program at 85 degrees and then cools at four degrees immediately.
Then he turns on the machine with a cock and flows a pasterized white basic cream, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream.
Instantly, the docent is asleep with questions: Can it only make ice cream from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can a person experiment himself?
Luciano warns you to be abducted by the spirit of time to be unknown.
Who speaks of ice cream "only from natural supplies," apparently also used stabilizators - most natural products such as guar flour from guar grains.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream without stabilizers, but it must be sold during one day, otherwise it crashes and the customer eats the ice grain itself.
Certain variations of basic materials are released.
It'll be more embarrassing with the aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes in the ice cream taste according to the supplies that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit section or in the sugar section.
Besides, there are pills and creams.
"The suppliers will try to make you a lot of aromatic supplies."
"You should simply experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with ice cream from white basic material, which turns eggs into yellow cream and cacoa based on all sorts of chocolate temptation.
Now the participating course for ice cream machines.
Luciano lets them always make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and liquid ice cream - either with eggs or without them in basic material, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural supplies.
The same experiment will be performed with fruit ice cream species.
More aromatic substances, more fruitful pyre - given the taste, it's not always better.
The ice cream must not taste more nuts when it contains more peanut peanuts.
The most favorite ice cream of kivi will produce a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizator.
Only when the balanced mixture raises the right taste of Gelato, Luciano says.
The production of ice cream is a purely number of tasks: If the peach pyre with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar part of the basic prescription must be reduced.
There is a need for extra sugar porce for ice cream.
Luciano extracts a device which determines the contents of the fruit sugar (the wine measures the moss of grapes).
Fortunately, the figures make it easier.
The production of ice cream does not require as much body effort as before.
It does not only help the automatic production of basic materials.
There is also an ice mixture that puts the ice mixture in the cream at the same time and cools at minus temperature.
Despite all the automatization, we won't avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo will embarrass himself and his colleagues from the top to the bottom with fruitful pyrees when he gets out of control of a huge mixer.
"In every course," thinks Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time when something like that happens."
Auditors in double light
The European Food Authority of the EFSA is associated with an industry that experiments with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of experts of Testiotech, which is considered an independent Institute for Biotechnology Effects.
"That sounds like a spinning theory, but we have documented it well," said Monk's boss Testiotech Christoph then on Wednesday.
The leaders of the Efsa Group for Geneticly Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and other experts of the Efsa have already been treated with the Lobist Union of Ilsi for several years.
This is funded concerts like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper participated in a decisive way in the EFSA control rules for genetic plants and thus stands in a clear conflict of interests, criticizes Then.
It is said that the EFSA rules are in accordance with the entire paragraphs of Ilsi documents and carry the manuscript of the industry that should be controlled by the Italian Parma authorities.
It's the second time that Testbiotech tells us about the conflict of interests.
Recently, the high manager from the EFSA has passed without supplements or transitional time to the Swiss agriculture concern of Singenta - and thus has changed the parties.
The broadcast for Central Germany (MDR) has also revealed a recent personal connection of the EU Office for Industrial Lobby Control, which has raised an interest in both the Ministry of Environment and the EU Members.
Meanwhile, EFSA can't recognize the conflict of interest.
It is worked with all serious data, i.e. those in the industry, if they are highly professionally qualities, as set out in one declaration.
The experts working for the Efs do not require that they do not have contact with industry.
But he has to testify them.
Kuiper acknowledged his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is only referred to as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and policy - except for the risk assessment of biotechnology without the lobbyst contract.
Independent experts such as then criticize that gentically modified plants are currently vacationed without any attempt to feed, and that the response of genetic plants to environmental effects is not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn in the field," said Then.
The current practice is only testing isolated proteins, not the entire genetic plant, which does not make reliable results.
"If they are not looking for risks, how could it be found?" he asks then.
Angelika Hilbeck also agrees with it.
Scientific employee has studied genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical High School in Curych.
In this area, industry is attempted as in the United States, and now more affect or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
That's why there are almost no scientists that would not be connected to the concerts.
In most cases, studies that are critical for companies are not published.
"Intelligence controls security research," Hilbeck believes.
Track of stones
Uli Gsell also got some, about 400 pounds.
On Monday night, he stood in front of Stuttgart station, tubu on his back.
It was a demonstration.
Snow.
The story is known: in September the bags arrived and began to crush a large piece of the northern wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: thousands demonstrated against S21, a billionaire reduction in the station.
When the construction was stopped, most of the wings were in ruins.
Broken to 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
A carpenter from Crailsheim, a soft gross stone used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell's a stagger in Ostfieldern, 43 years old.
He's got some of these pieces.
"Those stones are relics."
"He can't disappear."
It's like, "Live and poor stone, simple and original."
When one cut off, it smelled like a cigarette smoke.
What's he gonna do with those pieces, he doesn't know yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen on the former munitions of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He bought everyone who came up during the Stuttgart crash.
"It would be a shame if they had embarrassed on a sculpture or disappeared on the depony," said in his office, a wooden buddy, which was before a guardian house.
They tell him that they were giving him and threatening him when in September all the newspapers said he bought the remains of the northern wing from the company that was conducting demolition.
But he's been talking to the S-21 opponents all days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do a demolition at all.
And when this happens, then it's the most reasonable if the stones continue to be used.
Then about 200 S-21 opponents each one about 80 kilograms a heavy block, price for a piece of 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a memorial, some also hoped to bring him back in reconstruction.
Rongen bought 500 tonnes, a load of 25 large trucks.
About half is still in the woods, the rest has been sold a long time ago.
Gardens, territorial gardeners, builders home.
They arrived from all the corners and pulled out what came into the trunk and the trailer.
The stones of the Stuttgart dispute have long been converted into "free" or as an edge of vegetables.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If there weren't the political implication."
He gets into his field car and rides on a ride after his 20th hectare realm.
He studied first laws, he interrupted the study, later biology, then took care of computers, and eventually became a stone trader.
And the lover of stones.
It's stoned with 40,000 tonnes of stones.
He ties his treasure from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest trader with old stones in the Republic.
It's racketing.
The snow lies in artificially processed sand.
"Once they belonged to the Marien Bridge in the Dresians," he said.
The sand of the Labe, yellow, hot, excited.
"My favorite stone."
We're going on the way up the woods.
It points to a bunch: red sand, before part of the station in Karlsruhe.
Go ahead.
"A nice travertin."
One time they belonged to the tribune Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
There are stones and stories all over the snow, Cannstatt-travertin from the police presidency in Stuttgart, red granit from the Sankt Blasien temple, tuf from the Heilbronn hospital.
What a job, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones were ruined before and transported through simple locks and bullshit cars, he becomes totally respectable.
"It would have been a scandal if something like that had been scattered."
He hasn't become rich, he hasn't become rich anymore.
But today, a stone trader employs 14 people and, in addition, the stones in the woods were situated upstairs, one statue, one copper, one shrimp and one gardener.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the one who judges the rest.
He's got to go to Colin at the time of surveillance.
They'll be saving stones there too.
Talent fight for High-Potentials
There's a lot of people in the dining room.
16 students are pushed with salmon, tomato soups and sweets.
Technical university in Braunschweig and Volkswagen car manufacturers invited students of machinery and design to workshop.
Together with the developers of VW here, they should talk about the car of the future - and, by the way, to know Volkswagen.
Many companies try to race for the smartest heads, as well as VW, to succeed and bet on collaboration with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible, recruit the most reliable graduates in the servants, even before they get to the labour market and will be interested in others.
Since universities don't issue any lists of successes of their students, companies are trying to discover exceptional talents in projects oriented in practice and acquire them.
To TU Braunschweig is trying to get a car concern to get talents the next day.
One young lady from the personal department is distributing suits, rubber bears and VW logs.
He tells the reliable young talents about practice programs, student employment and suggests their ways to the concert.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig is taking care of the project with VW.
They see the benefits for both sides: "The students will get into contact with industry and gain experience."
"VW can meet students at the same time, get closer to meet interesting candidates and think about who would be acting as a co-worker."
Such co-operations, according to Selle, aren't unusual.
But the news is, she's so openly fighting for students.
"And it was rather a substantial professional project," said Selle.
The struggle for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many sectors, companies are no longer able to select their employees from the long crowds of applicants.
On the contrary, they must try and try to attract particularly highly qualified working forces.
In particular, engineering graduates have excellent negotiating positions.
According to the Union of German VDI engineers, 40,000 engineering positions remained in October.
And according to VDI predictions, the lack of engineers will grow.
The KPMG Auditor and Consultative Company is taking Roman Dyct for the hunting of talents.
It organises difficult Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a type of modern treasure race where participants need to find a way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students in the U.S. next year.
At the same time, participants can look at the KPMG branches and meet the company.
In advance, it decides in two selection wheels who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème flys from many interesters to the United States.
In the High Potentials struggle in universities, they will be paid by the Dycta's laws.
"We want to distinguish with our Race from the others."
"The one ghost trip to the sailing room was too little for us."
Looks like Dyct's talent hunter's lucky.
"We have been in touch with all the participants of a similar event last year."
"Some people will soon end the study and plan to work with us," he says.
In addition to direct addressing the campus, small and medium-sized companies are presented classically on the labour markets.
"We're trying to contact graduates at expert exhibitions."
"As for Intersolar," states Sitha Stübe, head of the Solar Technology Producer of Solar Technology.
The Bonno company employs about 1500 employees in Germany.
Stube knows the problem with young workers.
Currently there are 35 positions on the company's website.
"It's just complicated at the moment to hire free places."
"It's worth a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is to contact the professors at the universities.
Solarworld is cooperating with various high schools, such as Freiberg University.
"Professors inform us that we can do practice or write graduate work."
Solar specialist doesn't do any expensive advertising activities.
Instead, the company is trying to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchia and easy communication.
"The great concerts often cannot offer it," said the head of the Stube Personal Division.
For a long time, money has not played a major role in looking for jobs.
Flexible working hours, child care or good possibilities of the procedure are other decisive factors.
Solarworld hired in a study of the Great Place Institute to Work 55. place between 100 best employees in Germany.
The Institute comprises a annual list of the best German employees.
In addition, he asks the collaborators how they are satisfied with their work and the work environment and monitors the framework conditions of employees.
The head of the Stube Personal Division hopes that the location will bring points to the stakeholders.
"I believe that the stakeholders are particularly informed of the external evaluations of the potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a long-term strategy a good reputation as a employer.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Kriegler, that means mainly internal measures.
"The best way to be seen as an attractive employer is through his own employees," he says.
It is officially called the Internal Employer Branding, which is the promotion of the employer on the market within its own employees.
"The satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When the company takes good care of its people and they identify themselves with the company, they will make advertisements to their employers between friends and friends.
"It's like a rope game," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil balls
During the next years, they will not emerge before the coast of the United States of Florida in the Mexican Bay of the new oil tower.
The government in Washington issued a proper ban - and thus cancelled its previous plans.
Even before the Atlantic coast, new gardens are forbidden.
The Minister of Interior Ken Salazar told it on Wednesday.
The reason for a strict ban that should pay for at least the next five years is the explosion on the tower "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before this disaster, which cost 11 employees life and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled his willingness to allow new gardens in the eastern part of the Mexican Gulf.
The advocates are trying to reduce U.S. dependence on oil supply from abroad.
It is not clear to be explained by today who is responsible for the destroying oil disaster in the bay.
The center of the criticism is the British Energy Concern BP, which is confronted by billions of applications.
The Investigation Commission, which Obama has authorised, should present the results during December.
In October, the Minister of Interior, Ken Salazar, restrained the bargain that paid for the explosion.
Thereafter, various oil concerns of the requests for new floating purposes have been submitted.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent similar disasters from stricter controls and strict security regulations.
At present, a supervisory authority, which has noted itself by many corrupt charges, is being crucially reformed.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would cancel the lucrative options of tax escapes for oil and gas concerns.
Industries now openly warn that more strict regulations are essentially reducing the volume of weighted oil in the bay.
"The government plans are the biggest brake for gas and oil industry growth," the result of the current research in the field of the BDO advisory company - before the wednesday's ban on diversion.
American Energy Alliance still complains about the uncertainty in the field: "No one knows exactly what the regulation changes."
Investments in new workshop projects are being moved to the revocation - to an expense of growth.
The Tails Area has been burned
The water in the rivers is brown, it smells like a pump: billions of liters of out-of-oils destroyed the nature in the Ogoni area in Nigeria.
People are fooded by stealing, corrupting and illegal cooking oil.
Celestine Akpobari thinks well.
"Don't worry," calms the journalists of the ecological activist, "You're going to get a lot of oil bladder before the objection today."
A 37-year-old Nigerian observed an attempt to photograph a boy who wandered around the breasts of water surrounded by the smuggles: this scene works in a water glance with spirit colors almost pretty.
The fact that underneath the surface the brown collapse of oil can't be seen.
She used to gather enough garnels here, tells Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetta River.
Meanwhile, the water was slowly flowing completely dead.
Five years ago, a huge wet area of broken oil was poured out.
The fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must fall at least six hours to get into the waters where fish are: the area of Ogoni, which is located in the heart of the delta of Niger, belongs to one of the worst poorest areas in the world.
On the road along the river with many sideflows, the whole range of launching is only famous.
The boat cooks instead of light waters with brown cakes, and whoever floods his hand into the water, pulls the oil fingers.
The roots of the mangrowers are stuck from the ground like black pharmacists, rarely appearing palms leave their leaves sadly hanging.
We vainly look for birds that normally occur in wet areas: Once the engine silences on the boat, it will go out in the previous paradise, where it smells like pumps, scary silence.
"What happens here is the ecological war leadership," Celestine Akpobari sadly says, "We live in constant health care."
The comparison with the war is justified.
The area of Ogoni's settlement is a battlefield, where he has been fighting for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe, here, in the 1980s, was the first resistance with Ken Saro-Wiwa later executed, here he had to stop Shell's production in 1993, because it was too dangerous for employees.
To date, the company cannot return to the Ogoni area: while it comes from the entire area of delta with three sizes of Switzerland with more than 5000 busy gardens and 7000 miles of leading over two million barrels of black gold, the oil field is located in the area of Ogoni boat, the concern is too unstable.
Every hundreds of meters of the steel structures of the water, like bizarre statues: "Christmas", so they call themselves too gently heads of the warm holes.
They're 50 years old, most of them are cut off.
Every moment such a head of a spinning hole breaks, tells Akpobari, and then the constant stream of oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion litres in the delta ecosystem in 50 years has arrived in the 50 years: each year, the amount of oil that arrived in the sea in Aljaska during a super tanker 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in human history.
There are disputes that are still responsible for the ongoing ecological disaster.
While the Shell concern marks sabotage and organised oil stealing for more than 90 per cent of pollution, environmental guards speak of spraying heads and intimate leads as the main cause.
Shell requires a much smaller security regulation in Nigeria than a custom in the world, commented on the concern in 2008 US scientist Richard Steiner: Only the quantity of leadership disorders is "a few times higher than anywhere else".
In a place that appears from a distance like a deserted oil, a dirty oil work under the wide sky, the figures will come out of the mangroves: they are completely naked and until the neck of oil.
Under one of the many vessels that are partially connected by the leadership, partially dispersed on the ground, fire burns: illegitimate little raphineries.
The rape is warming over the fire for a few hours, explaining Michael, the leader of the group.
First, it runs out of the lead to the gasoline cap, later hats at the end of the leadership of kerosin and finally oil.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators make up a day to four courts of 300 litres: "We're making 34,000 Naira" -- about $22.
The population of Delta uses chronic lack of engines in the largest oil state of Black Africa.
Nigeria owns only one raphinery.
Funnyly low price 40 cents per litre of oil can still be overcome by illegal producers: because they have raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers", which are connected to leading everywhere in the Ogoni: according to experts, in the entire area of the Niger delta, the country is lost at least 16 million litres of oil.
But only a small part of the illicitly stored raw materials will be illicitly disposed: the largest share will fill organised criminal networks, including politics and high-powered military representatives, in tankers and sell it on the world market.
The debate whether the inhabitants and their intrusions or the lax method of production have caused the disaster, the Akpobari activist considers a purely academic.
"If oil companies weren't considered aliens and if they were not perfectly destroying the life of the fishermen, it would not have been sabotage or stealing and illegal raffineries."
Meanwhile, Ogoni's relationship is mostly so ruined to Shell, that it appears only to the departure of the concert: "The other nations may be shown as the Chinese as better."
Michael's worried.
"The highest time to disappear," said the muscle producer.
"The soldiers can come any time."
If a special military unit finds them, they don't get imprisoned, but a painful bribe.
Also soldiers who mostly come from the north of the country - like all the Nigerians - want to profit from raw materials.
"This goddamn thing has got our land in all ways until the bottom," says Akpobari.
Investigators discovered a dangerous construction error in A380 engines
A380 apparently has a major security impairment.
The investigators found a possible construction error that could lead to a catastrophic failure of the engine.
The aviation company Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The Qantas Airbus travellers had apparently more happiness at an emergency landing in the beginning of November than it was ever known: the Australian Air Safety Authority has discovered a major security obstacle during its investigations on certain A380 engines - and now warns against a possible construction error.
The disturbance may have severe consequences: one oil connection could have broken up because of consumption, sounded this Thursday in the public declaration of the ATSB.
This fact could lead to a catastrophic failure of the engine.
These are engines made by Rolls-Royce in 20 planes of A380.
Among them is also the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now taken legal steps against the British producer of turbines.
She filed a complaint with the Australian Common Court in Sydney, which allows for further legal measures against this company.
Qantas Alan Joyce's boss said his company would request compensation for an incident in early November.
During the engine's fire, parts were released and the nose surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce marked the cause of burning oil.
After this event, they must exchange up to 40 motors around the world.
Australian investigators announced that they would conduct additional safety tests with giant aircraft equipped with relevant engines.
Safety Recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB Martin Dolan.
Safety deficiency was considered important enough to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing, Qantas left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines left three of its 11 A380 on the ground.
Lufthansa exchanged one A380 as security.
The two-path aircraft is the biggest personal plane in the world.
The whole state of snow causes chaos in transport
Germany all in white: almost all over the country snowed overnight.
Many roads are ruling chaos, train connections and aircraft are disrupted.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
The winter of Germany is freezing: almost the whole Republic has fallen on Thursday at freezing temperatures with snow -- which leads to many places to transport chaos.
In the north and east, some places are about 15 inches of snow.
On several roads and many roads there is a strongly limited transport.
At A7 in Flensburg, the road service was still in place, but it was not a new snow.
There was still a strong blowing wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Swimming and Hydrography (BSH) expects the Baltic Sea Coast in Šleswik-Holstine in the morning a violent inflammation with water state of 1.2 metres above the normal.
Snow curtains caused significant problems in Saska on the roads and state roads.
According to Meteomedia's bad weather center, there was therefore a degree of violet alarm in Saxaya - at all the highest degree.
From the part there, 30 inches of new snow, strong and fresh winds caused curtains.
There were a few cars left last night.
Also in Sascu-Anhalt, police authorities reported great trouble on roads.
A2 caused wind and snow slow operation and trap.
There were troubles in Durinsk with snow on A4 and A9.
According to the German Road, there is a huge problem in Saska, Sasku-Anhalt, Durin and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on railways, reversed trees on railways or broken upper leadership and shifts.
In Saska, remote operation from Lipska to Norimberk must have been stopped.
In Durinian Saalfeld, one ICE must have stopped at Mnich.
165 passengers received wool blankets, food and drinks in the train.
The snow wind waves over the road.
In large German airports, snow winds have been cancelled for many years.
According to the speaker, the Mnich's cancelled flights have already been reported for years information.
In Frankfurt, Nach Mohan has been cancelled according to Fraport speaker for 40 years.
The maintenance of the roads is in continuous placement.
There are only few passengers left on the airport, but 400 field beds are ready for them.
Many roads have happened on Wednesday night to accidents.
Tonight, a truck driver died at a train crash in the eastern Holstland.
The engineer was slightly wounded.
Because of the snowy road, a similar accident occurred near Norimberk: there was also a car captured on a railway ride because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Norimberk remained closed until the morning.
And there was a 30-year-old woman who died after she turned her car into a slippery road at Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists have a good news: the snow will remain in the form of light quest, so it will also be raised in light blows of the wind.
But the wind will weaken.
Only at the Baltic Sea will be rapid winds with the power of the wind.
But it's going to be a big cold - locally to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for twins
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to one newspaper contribution, a bank is searching for a buyer for two towers with offices in the headquarters in Frankfurt.
The real estate could be up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its seat of the concert: twins in the Frankfurt bank quarter have modernized; while bankers were allowed to return to their old jobs.
But now he apparently wants a financial concert of renovation costs again - and is looking for a buyer for both clouds, as the Financial Times Deutschland informs, with the appeal to the speaker.
The speaker did not specify the reasons for the planned sale.
"We are still investigating whether it is more meaningful to own or sell and then rent again," he said.
This reverses the largest credit institution in Germany after a short time.
The Bank only took over the tower twins in the middle of 2007 for 272 million euros from its own fund investors and subsequently renewed them.
The energy reconstruction has been swallowed according to the data of about 200 million euros.
Sales would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
The experts in the field estimate the value of the towers renamed at "Greentowers" at approximately 500 million euros according to the newspaper text.
The speaker said that it was not decided whether the building would be sold again into the property of the Fund or an independent investor.
Thousands of grief for dead miners
More than 10,000 people honored the memorial of the new Zealand's miners, who were declared dead after several explosions in the underground.
Still failed to deliver the dead because the security situation remains complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth, there was a strong explosion.
29 miners aged from 17 to 62 were in the underground.
In the mine where there was an accident, the probe was launched, but it did not reveal any sign of life.
Because of high concentrations of poisonous gas and the following explosions, the safety of the rescue forces could not be achieved.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts came out of the fact that the miners had no chance of surviving.
We still haven't been able to deliver the dead.
Now they honored the memorial of the dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth, the southern island of New Zealand, ten thousand people gathered at sun weather.
They were silent for two minutes.
For the honour of the memorial of the miners, 29 tables were built, on them helmets, lamps, and names of miners.
Also pictures and personal things, such as clothes and surfing boards, found their place here.
There were flags in the government buildings on half the yard.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would reap from the "depth of the country" to the surface, said to the participants the memorial action the Minister of New Zealand John Key.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he saw his corpse, Laurie Drew, whose son Zen was stuck in the underground.
The memorial action took part other than the ministerial President and relative victims, as well as several foreign diplomats.
During the explosion on November 19th, British and South African miners were also invaded.
The rescue officers began by fireing fire inside the coal mine in the Southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the poison gas is unsolved, the cooling of high temperatures inside the underground, President Gary Knowles told journalists.
Hell, warriors!
Is horror suitable for the art movie?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to overcome the old border again with his battle epos "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he was filming "Walhalla Rising"?
The captured Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) will be freed from his torturers and in a large he kills almost with the supernatural force of his opponents - sounds perfectly for young men's watchers who are looking for bloody actions, because our hero helps himself with cruel killing methods and his enemies wreck even the innerness of his stomach when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, the Single Eye, as it is actually called, will not say a word throughout the movie, and even other figures will make up to one or two sentences or let them strike to the pastious dying screams.
Otherwise, they are silent and hungry in a territorial beautiful hilllands of Scotland, which offers the world of Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is rather ideal for adults' enthusiasm movies with interest in existence and very calm camera recordings.
It's good when he has more target groups, it's just a shame when they exclude each other.
The director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and styled trilogy on drug dealers "Pusher", is considered Danish version of the director Quentin Tarantina, but stoially prevents his work from getting closer to the main stream or less brutal art audience.
Most of the fans of the art movie appear to be distracted everywhere by syringe brains and inners.
The advocates of action films will be bored at the latest time when the One Eye is released for freely explainable reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries of ships to Jerusalem and remains hanging forever in no air and fog before the man apparently supplies to America and keeps silent there.
So there's nothing to be surprised that "Walhalla Rising" didn't get into the movies in Germany and now it was issued only on DVD.
It's a shame mostly because of the beautiful films, but also because it's behind the special fasada, places to collected blood, hides an exciting cinema that deserved a little attention.
In this movie, it's not about dialogues or accurate story, it's all atmosphere, a hot dream that became a movie.
And it's not for the audience to escape.
Refn does not allow him a moment of relaxation and slowly chokes him with his freezing recordings and the cloud hypnotical soundtrack, mostly but unrescribeable hatred that comes from the heart of the figures.
Only a little blonde boy who helps the One-Eye keeps something like innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
Of all the one-eyed hero whose motives will never be explained, which will become time for enemies and transitional allies as a warrior from hell, perhaps a messenger of the devil.
It creates a ruin, but perhaps only for the corrupt ones.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
Miscellaneous Earth Works
The IAEA Nuclear Energy Office has new notifications on the secret nuclear programme in Syria.
But the country is preventing expressions - and it will not even allow controls.
Around midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli battle planes F-15 I the mysterious fourth building in Syria.
It stands on the shore of Euphrat; the nearest largest city is 30 miles away and is called Dair as-Saur.
In the documents of the International Nuclear Energy Authority (IAEA), its name appears when it comes to a reactor that Syria reportedly built with the assistance of North Korea in this square hidden in the valley which departs from the stream.
On the basis of the US-American Foreign Secret Service of the ClA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village el-Kibar, would be well thrown into the production of plutonia - from which nuclear weapons can be built.
The technique of the '50s is not good for anything else.
The ClA presented a video with uncontrolled satellite images.
With computer animation, she explained where which parts of the reactor before destruction could be, it should be a reduced copy of the North Korean nuclear centre model Yongbyon.
Furthermore, photographs were presented that showed the building closely or even inside.
The reactor was said shortly before the launch, but no fuel articles yet.
Today, after more than three years of bombing, there is no knowledge of much more than that time, even puzzles have increased in time.
The former US-President George W. Bush recently announced in his memory that the CIA was very sure before the attack that Syria was building in el-Kibar reactor, but in fact she had no grounds that there was a "active nuclear weapon programme in the country".
Some secret services rapporteurs in Europe are even more cautious and only speak of "the alleged reactor", even though the CIA presentation is "reliable".
They're missing clear evidence, as well as IAEA.
On the question of how sure he has a reactor, he answered the high diplomat of the UN in the summer, the IAEA said he has "as enough material to ask questions".
The substance of the allegedly "non-used military buildings" was quickly cleared and also properly equipped the field.
However, the IAEA team was able to find in June 2008 under the leadership of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar uranium traces made by humans.
Furthermore, IAEA received over the Member State a satellite photograph of commercial sellers from the time of attack that should be more precise than those presented by the ClA.
Unfortunately, these recordings are not on the market because they have been bought exclusively by an unknown customer -- perhaps Israel.
Therefore, IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria always claimed that she never had a secret nuclear program, and she didn't even build a reactor.
Uran is from Israel’s weapons, and the Damasch said.
But IAEA did it after analysing particles.
Since then, Damask refuses to discuss things - as well as satellite recordings.
Furthermore, he prohibited second inspection to auditors in el-Kibar and access to the ruins of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silently silent.
"We will never comment on this," confirmed recently the official opinion of the ruling Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case is thus unsuccessful since June 2008 and is "increasing to a serious problem with regard to the credibility of the Authority", as the high Western diplomat in the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, is a serious violation of the nuclear weapons prohibition treaty that IAEA is observing.
IAEA considers the key to progress in the matter of other three facilities that should be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and, unlike it, still exist.
However, the auditors have not yet indicated, which equipment they are, or what they have function or why they are suspected.
According to the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, IAEA is internally referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, taken again by nearby cities.
Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found on satellite images a complex of buildings, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
Apparently, it is located inside or in the immediate closest of the military base - for that reason Syria refuses access to these three places.
In Vienna, the Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that IAEA would be previously sent to find military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the U.S. secret service equipment.
IAEA has grounds and satellite images that between these three places and the square in Euphrat, the material was transported here and there.
In Vienna, a high Western diplomat said that at least one arranged should be "in connection with the production of fuel".
However, there are no "not evidence of sensitive activities", namely the enrichment of uranium and new processing; processes necessary to produce nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven by uranium which is not wealthy.
But where the uranium comes from and where the plutonium should be plutonized to the bomb later, there are only possible estimates on these central issues.
It is also not known whether the wrecks that may hide important tracks are stored in these three places.
As if they disappeared from the surface of the hundreds of car car costs, no one seem to have the information where the substance came from.
Only a few miles away from el-Kibar a distance and on the other side of Euphrat laying the salt mine al-Tibni, which Syria allowed to check in 1998 as a suitable storage for radioactive waste, IAEA considers it unlikely.
Former IAEA Inspector Robert Kelley put him in connection with the reactor in a single satellite image analysis for a renomed magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, the images from the universe show that after IAEA demanded access, Syria carried out all suspicious groundwork and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clarify the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles speak that IAEA has spent many months creating a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to keep possible military secrets - only the effort shows how much the interest of auditors is.
In the meantime, Damask rejected this proposal.
If western diplomats in Vienna have reconciled that the reactor is destroyed, and that is why it is not burning, the U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has spoken for months of the so-called special inspections, which is one of the hardest means that the Vienna Nuclear Office has to initiate controls.
The chief of IAEA Yukiya Amano, who had to propose an inspection, has already spoken of the "possibilities I'm facing in the future", yet he is hesitating.
This option has a great risk: on the one hand, most of the Governing Council of IAEA is needed, and many of the 35 countries represented are definitely not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat warns, "What happens if they finally find nothing?"
Love during War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on still unnamed directives in the summer, there were troubles.
She wrote her own scenario, it was a love story of a woman from Bosnia and Herzegovina and a man from Serbia.
There's a lot more to know yet -- but it also causes no calm.
The woman who is a Muslim will be in love with a Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's communities immediately protested, so the planned films from Sarajevo to Hungary quickly moved.
Meanwhile, the film came in Hungary and is in post-production, but still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic, from the Organization of Women's War Victims, wrote through the UN-Organization to assist UNHCR Jolie refugees and asked to meet with the actress, now the Bosnian newspapers - Jolie is also Ambassador of the UN-organization to assist refugees.
She's not very diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In camps where they were raped, love stories have not been found, and Jolia’s attitude towards the victims is a lot about the scenario.
Its organization therefore recommended the UN-organization to help refugees to release Jolie as Ambassador, Guardian informed.
What exactly scenes did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received its scenario, allowed the smaller tahanics in Sarajevo's film - is not quite clear why Jolie still didn't come.
The young author emphasizes that she does not follow any political intentions in her film that she has made great effort to confront in Yugoslavia, to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give to all participating parties space.
Given the content, it remains uncertain.
On the Internet, there is another version of a movie that sounds quite different: lovers knew each other before the start of the war and again meet when she is like a Bosnian Muslim incorporated into the Serbian camp where he serves as a guard.
Which really sounds quite different than "the promise of rape will fall in love with his torturer."
The fact that Jolie's film really begins before the war is true.
Jolie suggests that pressure is developed on it, which "is not fair and is based on the wrong information."
Now they can free her from Hollywood: by publishing her scenario illegally on the Internet, as they've done many times.
Nothing but gone.
This evening is good for Ira again.
No sign of sadness.
The home team dominates very much over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans are joyful about the sound of loud music, the ass of their feet.
Bailey-Pub in the Southern Cork, because the players throw tennis balls to three meters away into the beer cups - and hit themselves.
"Pive Pong" is called a bizarre theatre and it is possible to win 500 euros as a victory premium and tickets to Las Vegas for the world's world championship in a drink pong in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this screamed beer game and a restraining informant, it's not very good together.
Still, a 26-year-old man is trying to entertain, respond to the difficult question of what the future brings.
His plan is not a game passion in Las Vegas, he's going to interview New Zealand in January.
"I feel so weird about it," he says.
"It's so far and I don't have a job there yet."
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "only she got her dream work as Eventmanager, perhaps it's a good sign," says a young man and smiles.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of the three Tanner's relatives have tried to make their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, the social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT supplier in London.
Boys leave: Just like Tanners, it looks like in many families on the island.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in a visual period, foretold by experts of the Scientific Institute for Economic and Social Affairs of the ESRI in Dublin.
They count even by 2015 with 200 000 emigrants.
For such a small land with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the prophecies are confirmed, there will be similar immigration wave as Irish suffered in the 1980s.
After the decades of the rise that Irish brought to great prosperity, the uncomfortability is now expanded again.
The economic crisis contaminates mainly young, educated Irish, who have experienced only a rise.
Loss of employment and social departure seemed absurd in these years.
The necessity was everyone, the money was too much.
Meanwhile, three of the ten women and men are up to 30 years without work.
In Irish Times there are many letters from readers who complain: "Irish has everything coming from the hill."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers -- but who can, he goes away, and our land is losing the entire generation."
"The last one please turn it off."
Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees the future black because the government is just deceiving and the young people are not offering any views to the future.
"They have a minimum remuneration, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says 20 years old.
She watches her classmates move from one unpaid practice to another.
Her greatest concern is she'll have to move herself in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers a total service to work abroad.
"For beginners on the labour market, work in abroad is an excellent chance to do the first steps on the career stairs," said the manager.
There are photos of surfers in Australia and skiers on the snowboard in Canada.
The report is clear: working abroad is not galeums, but freedom and joy.
What it's like to build something else, Sean O'Donovan knows for six months.
Since a 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
He's just building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he goes to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan will rarely get home because he works in extra shifts so he can pay home loan for the house.
"The situation is sometimes really a little crazy," he says, when the first time after a long time, it crosses the threshold of his own house.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, which I'm not in fact."
He laughs disappointedly and walks in cooling rooms.
A small house stands in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, a big expensive car parking in the entrances.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for EUR 380,000 - 100% funded by loan.
"It was a crazy time, simple money was without many questions," he said.
Is he afraid that it doesn't have to go well with the loan?
O'Donovan's thinking for a while, he's going down a hot tea, and he says, "I don't have kids that I have to eat and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The construction engineer doesn't like crying that he hears so often.
"No one must hunger - our situation is not even as dramatic as before on this island," he says.
"When we work abroad, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we'll just feel like the Irish."
He laughs and then talks about his father who left in the last economic crisis to England.
"After seven years, he was back and life went on in Ireland, pretty simple."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Keep the future open and just wait for life to develop elsewhere.
He's been working in London for a few years, and why shouldn't it be good for him and his girlfriend?
But there is another thing that disturbs him quite in these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
She's afraid she could go off to a goodbye party.
"No emotions at all," he says, and he drinks a very good beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds anxious."
"Let's call it a party of departure, completely simple, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Common practices of democracy
The support for democracy in Latin America is increasing, as well as the support of private business.
Criminal activity raises greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions more influenced than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarometro study, which was conducted in 18 countries and exclusively exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in positions across the area.
In this year's survey, held in September and early October, two related things dominate.
First of them, Latin America has a relatively cheerful mood.
The second is the increase in the stability of positions towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several countries on the edge of the Pacific in South America has increased significantly (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where the economic growth in the average of 6% per year has increased from at least 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
It also grew up in Mexico, where the economy was recovered after a deep decrease in production last year.
But only about half of the questioned areas in Mexico and Brazil, two of the most people, are the convictions of democrats, which retrieves the regional average (see graph 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents across the area have expressed satisfaction with how their country of democracy works in practice is the same number as last year, but in comparison with 2001, when it was 25%, it is a large increase (graph 3).
Approximately 34% said that they trusted the mercy in their country and 45% trusted the government, again the same numbers as last year, but it was a big difference in comparison with 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic crisis undermine democracy in Latin America.
During the global financial crisis, support was likely due to the fact that many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and were looking forward to a strong recovery.
Furthermore, the stronger social security network has helped protect the poor.
(Economic Commission of the United Nations for Latin America announced this week that the ratio of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009, and this year again fell to 32%.)
However, the mood changes in the wide spectrum from the earth to the ground (see graph 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its departing President Luiz Inacia Luly da Silva reflected in the widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and the state of violent crime has been worsened.
For the second time since the surveys were started, more respondents across Latin America see the most important issue of crime rather than unemployment (see graph 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they or their close relatives have become victims of criminal activity last year, but that is a decline in comparison with 38% of the last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
The massive economic performance reflects the growing support for private business and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the area say private business is necessary for development, this percentage has increased from 56% of 2007 (see graph 6).
Approximately 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that allows the development of their country, this percentage has increased from 47% of last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuela respondents have the same view (and 80% supports private business), although their left president Hugo Chavez has many private companies.
Brazil is a country with a leading position in the area, as mentioned by 19% of the respondents (except 18% in last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year without change) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% in last year)
However, the United States are considered the most influenced countries in Mexico and in the largest part of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying the success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nikaragua.
Critical options
No one expected general elections in Haiti on November 28th to be perfect.
But they were much worse than outsiders trying to help the affected country to fear.
The elections meant full urnas and repeated votes, voting tickets broken across channels, broken election rooms and intimidation.
Election rooms open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many moved in because of the January earthquake, have traveled around and tried to find out where to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including several predicted preliminarians, screamed that it was a fraud and called after the cancellation of the elections.
Protests, some of them of violent nature, have spread throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, a highly built UN official in Haiti, declared that "in many respects it was quite good choices."
Observers from the United States and the Caribbean community carefully said that "does not believe that these disagreements, no matter how serious they were, did not need to cancel the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority whose opposition votes are bound to René Preval, the unpopular departing president and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should notify the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive fight is scheduled for January.
All the electoral hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates Michel Martelly, raper and Mirlande Manigat, the former first lady, resigned from their original challenge to declare the vote incorrect.
However, the problem may occur if Mr. Célestin, who has little or negligible support between the voters, is marked by the election committee for reaching a decisive fight.
Because of the ordering cholera epidemic and more than 1 million people still live in the states after the earthquake, the fears that the electoral participation would be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of disorganizing, they were prevented.
Approximately 250 000 identities, which are necessary for voting, remained unseparated shortly before the elections.
There's a lot in the bet.
The donors see the election of the legitimate and popular government as a key step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
So it is clear that the Haitians will be put on their own.
After the tops to the center
In the weeks when she suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernandez, the Argentine president, from the sympathy of the public, where her popularity increased from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Nevertheless, turning this success into a successful campaign for the second functioning period in the elections next year may depend on whether the grieving Mrs. Fernandez will give up the inpromissibility of her late husband, the precedent and the political partner Nestor Kirchner.
And on these signs, everything will be based.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued in economic policy and after his wife has successfully become president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This enabled the first couple to spend more revenues on their own.
The government of Mrs. Fernandez lost most in Congress last year.
But the opposition was divided and was further destabilised at the death of Mr. Kirchner to the heart attack on October 27th.
Some members of the ruling political movement, Peronist, joined Mrs. Fernandez.
But after chaotic meetings (which had occurred to fake and accuse the government of corruption), Congress was unable to approve the budget for 2011.
"I'm not going to object," the president said.
The 2010 budget will also be paid for the next year, with more room for the president to spend by liberty.
Economy is overheated: this year is likely to grow up to 9%.
The official inflation rate is now at 11.1%, but many private estimates and experts are talking about numbers that are approaching 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who joined the Office in 2003, when Argentina had severe economic collapse, set a priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than for inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, burdened the private sector and cleared the INDEC, a statistical agency that has joined the monitoring of official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernandez now diminish this policy?
She called for negotiations between private enterprises and committee broadcasts.
And her officials say that next year they want to limit the growth of remuneration to 18%.
The economy was supported by the growth of world prices for exports of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation has broken growth based on great devalvation in 2002.
This may be the reason Mrs. President Fernandez is to know that she wants to renew the Argentine financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government has made an agreement with debt holders who have previously refused to restructure the debt that Argentina did not pay in 2001.
Now, Mrs. President Fernandez is facing the agreement with the creditors' governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, which owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted not to surveillance the fact of the MMF as usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" in order to design a new national consumer-price index to remind the initiation of INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether Mrs. President Fernandez will wish to remain in politics after the end of the functioning period, when her husband is no longer by her.
If he wants to stay, he needs to receive the support of the middle class that is tired of circhnerism.
When the Argentinians return from the summer vacation they have in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If he wants to win another choice, he will have to decide whether it will not be necessary to renounce the many views that her husband has in politics.
Half-courage for China
Taiwan voters are closer to a closer link to the land.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother over the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the authorized voted on 27 November of the Mayor and the City Council in five cities, which may be considered a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. President Ma himself is the representative of the feelings that they have overcome and have strong positions in business relations, including a partially free trade agreement, in the largest comparison of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma passed the test, but just close.
Although his Party Kuomintang (KMT) finished the victory of three of the five Mayor's offices, she failed to win most of the votes.
Consequently, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is inclined to greater independence of Taiwan, won almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT Party.
If it was a presidential election, President Ma would have trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the share of his party's votes decreased about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party was together with KMT in urban councils.
The elections took place as most of the Taiwan elections, including noise electoral cars and mass meetings with flags with disagreeable dressed girls.
Part of it was even an obligatory mysterious attempt to assassinate.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, Honorary President of KMT, was anxious for KMT candidates at the evening of elections.
A man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien straight across his face, hurt him and killed the audience.
It was not bizarrely determined whether the armed person was intending to injure Mr. Lien or to solve a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-Wen, director of DPP, claims that the shooting has affected the elections, suspects fall on DPP and leads the voters towards KMT.
Hopefully the only great winner of the campaign was China.
It was amazing how it remained in the background of the land itself.
Instead, the candidates have been incorporated on plans for the state building and the creation of jobs.
Taiwan usually enjoys his de facto independence and hates military threats to China.
Therefore, KMT has a tendency to avoid links to the Peking government.
But this time, DPP also dropped from the incitement of anti-Kinean attitudes.
It is a response to the fact and awareness that Chinese trade is essential for the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr. President Ma confirmed that China's policy was acceptable to most of Taiwan.
From the Peking government, it can be expected that it will continue to continue in commercial bribes, together with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the flock.
China did not waste time to send the negotiator to Taipea to arrange a summit on the protection of investments and medical cooperation.
Surely they would also like to see political integration, but in order.
It will be better to wait for it after the presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP Party, in any case, discovered itself.
Two years ago she was on the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to jail on the basis of a corrupt charge.
The president in 2000-08 was a violent and clear independence.
But under the leadership of Mrs. Tsai, a new generation has developed, which is moderate and DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Ms. Tsai was called as a DPP candidate for the president, such as Su Tseng-chang, who was in charge of the office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing everything to show that they can also cooperate with Peking.
Mrs Tsai published plans for research institutions which serve as a contact place between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without preceding conditions.
Ms. Tsai informs the Taiwan public that her party represents a "confidential alternative" to the rapid approach of Mr. Ma to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry with this movement.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed his view that the DPP candidates would be better if they insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, the Pragmatic, not to be president.
But even without Mr. Chen's interference, DPP will fight for a choice between potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's assessments were bad, even though the excessive rate of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to go to the campaign.
His unfamiliarity seems to be based in particular on unemployment and promoting deficiencies between the rich and the poor.
The KMT speaker says he'll reorganize his office, as well as the local branches.
The strongly promoted proposals for Taiwan's support for friendly contacts are limited.
At the same time, most of the Taiwan citizens consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an excellent publicist, "the point from which there is no return has already passed."
Nomination at the price of Grammy: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in category the best new artist
At the request of the President and the people must note legally.
Esperanza Spalding, 26-year-old jazz basin and singer, which President Obama chose to present at the Nobel Price Ceremony for Peace in 2009, is marked as one of Gramma price surprises this year with a nomination in the category of the best new artist.
Since Spalding was a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" came out, the nomination came a little late, but it is in accordance with Grammy's rules where the artist cannot issue more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is defined."
Her ambitious album of 2010 "Chamber Music Society" definitely recorded a step forward and thanks to her careless vocal style and her hard-handed hand with the elements of Pope, Funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as the success that Nora Jones had recorded in 2003, the nearest equivalent for the Gramma voters who are looking for a similar jazz work in this category for the last years.
Otherwise, the jury of Grammy rightly appreciates the album Vijay Iyer Trio "Historicity" in the instrumental album category, exciting, refreshing album ride, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album of the tested saxophonist James Moody "Moody 4B" and John Beasley's "Positootly" keystones.
Trombone Shorty, crushing favorite from New Orleans and a common guest in the HBO "Treme" show was evaluated in the current jazz category, which is differently affected by the albums of Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
A wild group of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with knowledge steampunk gained several deserved recognition in the categories of large files when the competitive was standing by a chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the oct "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how the bassist can have a free hand as a chapeler.
Nominations Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical music category
Classical music nominations at the 53th annual prices of Gramma have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world.
The leading position in the nomination has Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" as piano and orchestra, with five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three points.
Among the nominated ties to Southern California, an estonic composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work ordered through Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted in Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also has a chance to appreciate.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories that include orchestral, opera, congregation and sali recordings.
The category for the producer of classical music of the year has five nominated as Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Simphony" from Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" introducing various artists; and Verdi "Requiem" from Chicago Simphony Orchestra and Chorus.
Regarding the category of opera, the nominations are Berg and "Lulu" from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kai Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" of Deutsche Simphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the Orchestra and Chorus of the Marin Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" from BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Among the composers who are nominated on Grammy for judicial songs, they belong to Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shhedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 had a Prime Minister in Disney Hall in January 2009 for a show recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under Esa-Pekka Salonena.
Approximately 30-minute work is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovski, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for an instrumental solist show with the orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he wrote a 15-minute work specially for the Mandolin interpreter Avi Avi Avital, who performed a concert with Metropolis Ensemble with a site in New York.
"I wrote it by means of tonnes from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone conversation.
The director Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in category for orchestral performance, for managing Chicago Symphony while recording the work of Stravinsky.
Among the instrumental solistists who received nomination include the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-Andre Hamelin; the Paul Jacobs; the violinist Julia Fischer; and Sarah Schuster Ericsson harphist.
Among the nominated vocal solists, only women were represented this year, Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic transition category, the sopranist Jessye Norman was nominated for her video "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned meshite in Temecula receives the approval of the Planning Commission
The planned meshite in Temecula has received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of a passionate public witness.
The criticians attacked the project that promoted terrorism and would lead to a stop of trade.
However, the jury decided that the new religious center is in accordance with local laws and will be estetically impressive.
"Mnoge good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you will remember," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Centre in Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"I am very proud of it as an American citizen."
"That means justice always wins."
"Opozition is minimal," he added.
"Those who are against, only yell loudly."
"We have really excellent people in our valley."
The proceedings began at six o'clock at night and lasted almost midnight when most of the time they took discussions with people who were for or against the center. These votes were equally divided, says Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the website of the newspapers.
"There's no more America," a comment appeared.
"We're the Planet of Monkeys with the Socha of Freedom falling in the sand."
"America fell."
The planned Islamic Centre also caused protests in other parts of the country, including the nearbyground Zero, the scenes of tragedy that took place on September 11, 2001, when terrorists attacked New York.
In Temecula Valley I have Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
His religious community reading approximately 135 families lived in Riverside County for years without an incident, but he wanted a larger and suitable space than a warehouse that he rented with a filter system manufacturer.
The new mess of 24,943 square feet in the Mediterranean architecture style will also have two minarets and will grow to a height of 43 feet.
It should take a seat of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, approximately three miles east of Chaparal High School.
The opponents can still appeal to the City Council on the project.
Microbes with resistance to arsene increase the possibility of new life types on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsene as one of its foods extends the space to search for new forms of life on Earth and perhaps even further.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacteria here on Earth and claim that it is a sign of life's possibilities that are beyond the main elements that have yet been considered and fundamental.
"This organism has double ability."
"He can grow either by phosphorus or arsene."
"This fact is very strange, but it is not proof that it is a form of really "external" life," commented Paul W. Davies of Arizona State University, a coautor of the news that appeared on Thursday in the online publication of the Science magazine.
For a long time it was considered necessary for the life of six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and cheese.
However, scientists found that the bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue growth after the arsene is replaced by phosphorus.
"He's starting to surprise you what's still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar from Arizona State University, a co-autor of the news.
This finding is important for searching for life outside the Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know how life can look, said Anbar.
Study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, the report of this news was published to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the findings, caused a wide speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of alien life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "indicates that other planetary organisms can be able to use other elements that drive biochemy and that a set of elements that we consider "standard" must be so necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, a professor at Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, British.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element by another element in basic biochemy and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a random discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon, from the NASA Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it shows a high level of arsene.
Arsene and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she thought that the microb exposed to both elements could be able to replace one another.
"Arsen is poisonous mainly because his chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can very hardly separate these elements from each other."
"Nonetheless, the arsene is so different that as much as phosphorus does not work. When he gets into the organism, he starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists gather bacteria known as GFJ-1 and expose them to growing concentrations of arsene that are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better in the effects of phosphorus, but since they can survive also with the replacement of arsene, the possibility that the form of life that uses arsens can appear naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the month where the arsene is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an expert assistant in microbiology at the University of Florida, declared that the idea of the arsene that could be replaced with phosphorus is not new but never found an example that this fact could be done.
Arzen was more common in the previous times on Earth, she said, so scientists speculated that it could be used by earlier forms of life.
"This suggests that there could be other ways to create life, not only the way it was created in the early period of the Earth," said Foster, who was not part of the research team of Wolfe-Simon.
Research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Institute
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs that someone stole from the Bellflower motel were found.
Four exhibition dogs - two akitas and welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, where they spent the night at the Bellflower motel 6, informed the authorities.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and two remaining dogs after Wednesday late night, said Steve Whitmore, speaker of the LA police department.
"The good news is that the dogs are okay," said Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were transferred to their owners of law."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in which location, he did not share detailed information about their finding.
"The investigation continues."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We keep the rules."
The dog owners, Christina Rickard and David Peek, weren't capable of speaking to the case.
They were very pleased to find two of their aquites in a shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's representatives found a van and two dogs separated in Compton.
Akity Trace, three-year-old Trace dog and 10-month-old Didi, were injured, informed by the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who planned to participate this week in district competitions on behalf of their Japanese owners, were not found until they discovered late on Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to attend AKC/Eukanuba National Championship at Long Beach, where they were planning to show Trace.
Other dogs were to compete in other competitions planned in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, said Peek to the The Times journal on Wednesday.
Southern California is only one stop at nearly monthly travel of a couple after dog exhibitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard registered the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the window of the room.
They also took three dogs - a boxer's puppy, Parson Russell terrier and a bretanic oven - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akita and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car where it was supposed to be colder.
They opened some windows in the car to have enough fresh air for the dogs.
Peek and Rickard announced car stealing at 6:00 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek said that he would offer a reward to anyone who would lead them to missing dogs. Dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it was not clear whether prices would be granted.
Lev is ready to scream again now when the MGM restructuring gets final approval from the court
After 18 months of shocks and uncertainty, MGM finally got green so that it could start again.
The federal insolvency judge of New York officially blessed the "pre-packed" plan of creditors to fix about $5 billion debt and to clean the way for 86 years of old entertainment company focusing on the production and production of movies and TV shows.
Thursday's reimbursement that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S.A.A.'s acquisitions do not remain any legal obstacles to restart the founders of Spy Glass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who become the main leaders of the exhausted study.
The number of employees falls about 320 of the original over 400.
MGM will not suddenly fall out of Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase agrees on planned financial resources allowing a loan of $500 million to finance new operations and production of MGM.
This is now about the connection with the investment bank, which needs $75 million itself and the funding is expected around half December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise the management of how to solve its finances, since the management struggle to afford interest payments of $300 million a year.
On August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former Director-General of Enron and an expert on turning, known for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The attempts of Moelis and Cooper to solve the financial difficulties of MGM and 140 employees of the study took much longer than expected.
After a few months, the parties agreed that by the end of 2009 the company would be given to sale.
Although the auction attracted a number of stakeholders, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion plus the finances that the creditors demanded.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team started working on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditor at the end of October.
When the MGM is officially arising from the audience in the next weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive millions bonuss in dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies that incast for their services run by the company, $355,000 a month, will receive award for success, namely "success fee" $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to renew the production in MGM, which issued only one film this year and compiled a proposal for seven or eight films that will come up at the beginning of 2012.
They also plan to participate in the financing of two movies, which will be the book "Hobit", together with Warner Bros.
The study needs to arrange a special loan between 265 million and 275 million dollars to finance its share in these two films that Peter Jackson will direct.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owned approximately 18% of MGM debts, was looking for the possibility of combining the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent negotiations between the two companies have not reached an agreement.
Technological toys that keep your budget for gifts in balance
The leading candidate this year is the most amazing iPad toy followed by the video game system, but in both cases it is a significant intervention in the present budget.
Consider that at the price of one iPad you can buy five wheels BMX for 99 dollars and one game Kinect is equal to 10 coral bars or about 48 glasses Play-Doh.
But there is a way to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national toy sellers -- Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club -- and watched what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law works; this year's technological toys have much more energy, at the same prices, if not something lower, compared to past years.
While relatively fewer new toys with connected webs appeared, two of the most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as well as a toy with batteries charged.
Here are some recommendations.
(All those prices are from Toys "R" Us, except cases that are identified differently.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13$, from 3 years) are the beast animals that sing when you press their stomach.
On one press, the animal produces a tone, and the second pressure starts to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start to kick, you can't stop.
Best choice in combination with singing and dance is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from 2 years)
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch animation doll that can play Simon Says and can walk a monthly walk because of his innovative compound leg with the blocking of wheels.
Children test the toy of Mickey dance instructor, although their parents complain about the lack of control of volume.
If you're a child in the 1980s, you may remember Alphia, one of the first computer toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, 40$, for children from 3 years), with a bag full of quiz cards that are designed to turn the car into fun with self-reflected, funny work sheet.
If you send a smartphone for your child, there are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60$, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest option with simple use, with qwerty keyboards, although games do not have as effective lessons as Leapster Explorer (70$, for children from 3 to 12 years), the first significant change of the Leapster from Leapfrog, with a new and clearer display.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90$, for children from 3 to 7 years) uses the iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has a slot on the SD card that allows you to display family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash (30$, Hasbro, for children aged 8 years) is a set of five cubes that are not bigger than a box of flames, each of them has a LED display.
The aim is to create words by putting cubes in line before time expires; it is great for competition in improvised word creation.
Still more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
Two toys of Webkinz and Club Penguin were represented in the toys.
If you want to buy an online toy for your child from Club Penguin, you can choose for example Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, 5$, for children from 6 to 12 years old), which contains coins with hidden code.
When you activate online code, your child gets enough credits in the shop Club Penguin store on any two items.
This could include, for example, a ringle or a animal of Puffle.
A little bit bigger than your toothbrush is Hexbug Nano ($10, for children from 5 years), the latest of a number of micro-robotes on the button battery.
The brook moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicon legs in random direction.
It's fun when you make a bone bone foresight and see if he can find a way out.
He's also very resistant.
The one of ours was able to fall off the kitchen table and spend some time even in our dog's foot.
Introduction of a gentle police check in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, strictly checked his orders and issued orders with military authority.
He wanted women - Chinese stated urban order-owners, feared and disregarded for their hard acts and involving violence - to merge a certain impression on the lounges of the surrounding.
"Get up straight!"
"Hurry!"
Show them, whispering quietly, "How nice girls look!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants have stood in the eye.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted as a line.
Four head covers are perfectly sitting on the hair that are perfectly tied with blue and white stripes.
"I personally think they look mean," Mr. Tang despisedly said.
"The models are nice."
More than one government tried to restore the picture of urban overseers in China.
One city ordered new defensemen to have high school education.
The province of Guangdong has changed the grey-green uniforms to the apparently more attractive blue.
Uhan in Central China replaced the denied views for strong arms: in 2009, a report stated that 50 officers were surrounded inconsistently by a cart with meals and were looking at the owner until the seller was packed and left after half an hour.
Xindu, city district with 680 000 people in Chengd chose surgery as a main image.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its city police with 13 women chosen specifically according to their appearance, proportion and young age.
The aim is to show other than the rough side of the police is also gentleer, women's side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson itself would have trouble getting into the secret Chinese urban groups.
They would've argumented the critics for a good reason.
In contrast to the police, they are allowed only to prosecute the city’s pronouncement, penalties and other administrative implications.
But Chinese communications are usually captured by a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors in the Hubei province slaughtered an uninterested audience to death after he used his cell phone to film, as they start in the case of a protest against the stamp.
Last year, the training of police officers in Peking took place, the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. There was, among other things, a description of how to beat the perpetrators without blood.
This year, a melon dealer in Shanghai got into a fight with five policemen and suffered the injury of the left part of the brain.
One video game full of violence, which can be downloaded on the Internet, shows Chinese policemen attacking the street seller.
"Chengguan frightened the government," China Daily, national issue, cried in last year after another discussion on tactics.
The paper was "truely cleaned."
The skeptics say that this isn't enough.
Once the district booked in October an interest in eight new female police officers, the introduction of the Beijing Evening News addressed the question of whether women have real obligations or are only distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The period demanded women aged from 18 to 22 years with a good figure and "five characteristics of the face in the right proportion."
The adepts should be higher than the average - so above 1.6 meters.
The age of 26 is obligatory.
Functioners claim that work is mentally too difficult for women over 25 years.
"Their image is an important thing," said one unnamed police officer on Rednet.com, as if government websites.
"The candidates must first prove external qualitys that then define others belong to the height, weight, the characteristics of the face, etc."
Then there comes a number of nature and "inner quality".
Women are like flowers, he said, and he added, "Besides being ties, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the District City, does not agree much with this description.
But he pointed out that height requirements in China are also common for other jobs, both genders.
Just like the requirement for the proportionate characteristics of the face.
Which means that the question of good mind is between the Chinese subject of discussions.
Health disabilities or crushing are certainly not applicable.
"He can't admit that he served a chrome or throat man with us," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who keeps a guard at the Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, faces like apples and gently shaped mouths.
She doesn't think the emphasis on her appearance could have a sexist slip, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironical view.
Her colleague with dolls, 21-year-old Xu Yang says, "Our task is to represent the picture of the city."
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just starting traders into streets where they can carry out their activities.
Each morning a group stands against more than ten marketers who run walks or bikes and try to sell as much tofu and tobacco dishes before they are expelled.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We have already told you a lot of times!" Ms. Xu said when the marketer started running, and for a while he left his bike with a cart with the nudles.
Policemen describe their obligations as more monotonous than hard.
"Each day is essentially the same," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies in her free marketing.
"Great routine."
One of the reasons is that women's cops have no power as their males so that sellers can sell the goods.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their men's leader.
The tendence is then to protect them from sudden public manifestations of enemy against the official equipment that are common within China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rebelled after false rumors were spreaded that the cops killed the seller.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured at night; 14 government vehicles were turned or burned.
Xinda has escaped such violence yet.
But peace can only be guaranteed hardly.
Only two blocks from the calm Baoguang square, where the police were watched that morning, more than 50 people gathered on the corner of the street.
The cops took over a motorcycle that was fixed on the trail instead of inside the sales store, as required by the rules.
The owner of the wheel could cry as he wanted.
15-minute distance before the police, faced anger, with elbows against vehicles and quickly off with the motorcycle and his owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, the coordinator attached to the male group, remained behind, his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like women's police, coordinators are men over 40 years of age who have only a helpful role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in maintaining and flipping images.
"We sometimes fight verbally."
"We sometimes fight physically," Mr. Li said really.
"A majority is the public that starts with it."
The prosecutors won't blame Senator Ensign.
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have cleared Senator John Ensign from the criminal charge, which was related to his affair with his former campaign advisor and his efforts to ensure lobby, the lawyers reported in the middle of the senator.
The most important legal threat that Mr Ensign, the Nevada Republican, has faced, and has been considered possible by the scandal, the Republican candidate for the president for 2012. His affair has reached national titles and has damaged his career.
Mr. Ensigna's office said that the decision followed nearly after the year's investigation was "surely pleased".
The Senator could still face disciplinary proceedings with the ethical committee of the Senate.
Mr. Ensigna's lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice "was informed that Senator Ensign will no longer aim to investigate and that it is not planned to raise further charges against him."
The Ministry of Justice refused to speak to the case.
The decision was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed that there were serious evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing a violation of a federal lobby ban.
The interviews, e-mails and other documents published in October 2009 in New York Times stated that Mr Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, provide lucrative lobbys that would lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife Cynthia, about the senator's relationship with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a treasure in the Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find a job for Mr. Hampton and support their views after Mr. Hampton was employed to lobby for them, so many documents and interviews.
Since Hampton was recently associate with Mr. Ensign, he was excluded from the law from the lobby of his former employer or the Senate for a year.
The ethics experts claim that the unusual arrangements of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, were in contrast with the prohibition of lobbying.
The evidence that was published "exhibited that it was a clear case of preparing a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in the case of Senator Ensign, Mr. Brand and other lawyers in the specialization of ethics, they said that the Ministry was cautious about the political complaints, after a large number of failures, including the last year's decision to suspend the complaint against former Senator Ted Stevens in the middle of the question of State representation.
The Federal Prosecutors "have clearly hidden the weapons," said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a lawyer group that filed several complaints against Mr Ensign.
"It points in fact to the fact that the highly established government officials do not apply laws," she added.
Paul Coggins, the chief attorney of Mr. Ensigna, told in the interview that he had been called by the State Department of Justice on Monday and then the other day, and told him that the Ministry did not seek any charges against his client.
The Defense Team of Mr. Ensign cooperates with the prosecutors in an effort to convince them that the Senator, as his office repeated in the medium statement, "has acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments he handed over to the public representatives.
"I don't feel pleasant to consider the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice except that we think they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to stop the investigation of a separate complaint in which the ethical group accuses that the payment of Ensign Hampton's parents in the amount of $96,000 violated the federal election law.
The Electoral Commission stated that it had no evidence to prove that the money meant nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobby job was NV Energy, the main Nevada company that long supported the Senator.
One e-mail of December 2008 proved that after Mr. Hampton started acting as a lobbyst in the company, the head of Mr. Ensign - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he "buffed" into the Ministry of Interior on the subject that was discussed.
Mr. Ensign also participated in lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevadian client, Allegiant Air, and called on the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the air society after they hire Mr. Hampton for lobbyst work.
When the afer report first appeared last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned his function as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After a multimonth stagnation, Mr. Ensign told the reporters two weeks ago that he planned to participate in the third election period in the Senate.
In the report that Mr. Ensign is no longer aimed at investigating the crime of his speaker Jennifer Cooper said that the Senator hopes that the ethical committee will quickly follow the Ministry of Justice and end the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his efforts in the name of the Nevada people," she said further.
Challenge of the village of Cheshire turns on Twitter
In the rows of the courtroom, half a dozen of them were written.
A minute after a minute, there were reports of a terrible testimony through Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140 000 Twitter reports were dealt with rape and binding children to beds in the house that was burned.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted for the murder of three Cheshire citizens, Connecticut, the family, and was to be formally terminated with the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed a complaint with requests and arguments that would probably hire the court for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intensive reporting of the process - including the extensive use of Twitter of main reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and this widespread, immediate prosecution of information with disturbing details then introduced the jury in a decision in terms of influence by the public's opinion.
This claim could force the judge to question whether new technologies also require new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced in this receipt, I think there is a real danger that the involvement of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair process for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, the chief defender of Mr. Hayes.
The judge of the Supreme Court of Justice of Jon C. Blue briefly rejected the claims relating to the remuneration of the last week and that the media were "to be carefully controlled" and that there were no evidence that would indicate that the jury acted under the public influence.
But it's probably not the last word in this case.
During the decades, the courts recognized that the reporting of noorically known cases could lead to questioning the justice of the process.
In the 1966 Court of Justice, the Supreme Court of the United States repealed the conviction of Cleveland Chiropractic, Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, in the process of communications, it was a "carneval atmosphere".
Some are convinced that this criminal act was the inspiration of the TV show and the film "The Tube."
Some lawyers said that the appeals of the courts that examined Hayes' judgment half a century later could be surprised by the argument that new rules might be necessary to determine the way of communication from the courtrooms, which was invisible in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media" in highly monitored cases, said John J. Donohue III, a professor of the Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was committed freely.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be obsessed with the idea that restriction of immediate communication from the courtrooms can make the process more fair.
The Twitter case is only one of the many shaded lawyers of Mr. Hayes who would be able to argument for years to delay the execution of the judgment.
For example, prosecutors argue that in the case of Mr. Hayes, it may be an advantage when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the responses of potential jurys by showing them a criminal photograph of the horror when choosing the jury.
Some of the jury said they were frightened by the victim's photographs that Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The prosecutors claim that they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge has wrongly revoked the jury, who was critical to the state representatives and has made his decision incorrectly pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think about the weekend.
The jury weren't separated.
But their arguments on the impact of the scope of the process may attract the greatest interest.
They objected to the verdict last month that the case was dominated by the reports in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign of the Governor and the United States Senate.
They argumented that the communications was constantly inflamming emotion flames in this case.
"The daily inflammation of media, cameras and reporters before the court," the lawyer wrote, "there was something that was not yet to be seen here in New Haven, and it might also be a national rarity."
Their focus on the impact of Twitter is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more disturbing than the reports mentioned later and, in their view, the judicial police should run the fields of other processes.
But some lawyers demanded appeals to courts with often used arguments that social and technological changes require the adaptation of courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are looking for this right.
In their archives, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 in the case of Dr. Sheppard's judgment, in order to expand the impact of the process and to clarify the requirement that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard case against Maxwell 21st century."
Can courtesy overcome the failure?
After a campaign that was incredibly insulting and negativeism, a small amount of courtesy appeared in Washington this week.
Is this the first part of the true cooperation of the two political parties or just an illusive moment before the quick return to the side fight in the capital?
The Tuesday negotiations of President Obama and the parliamentary leaders did not bring any substantial discoveries on the essential topics to be discussed during the meeting.
However, in any case, it was a courtesy debate on the differences in view of the two parties, as well as the definition of their common responsibilities, rather than the other empty episode of the party.
The Central Public Meeting of the President's Deficit Commission was also civilised, even in spite of the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that the close coefficient has built mutual respect for several months, which exceeds the ideological gap that still divides members.
And it's quite difficult to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both parties are now in the trial period - they test each other's signs of collaboration and compromise, trying to evaluate the public opinion borders and election patience against the renewed side war.
Therefore, the Tuesday and its subsequent assessment of participants were conducted with a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The philosophy differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to propose a rapid change in relations that are over the last two years.
Regardless of tax, expenditure, healthcare or rights, both sides are a mile away.
However, the November elections prepared Washington at least quickly.
"It is no question whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They are inevitable after elections.
The elections erupted the emotions of the strangers and then they shut up.
It's good."
In several matters, especially those to discuss meetings, the Republicans and the Democrats have a little chance to find solutions.
Bush's tax reduction at the end of the year has expired, and no one considers it favourable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, for a period of time or for a period of time.
Similarly, the probable compromise on unemployment doses is because the Republicans cannot see how they support tax reductions for property while unemployed people reject unemployment support.
After the Tuesday negotiations in the White House, there is more optimism on the possible agreement on these issues, together with ratification of the new starting contract.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institute notes that successful cooperation on key issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship of two political parties when the 112st Congress is convened on January.
Rather, the likely period of disagreements, or even inevitable, he said.
"After doing things that have to be done, psychology will in short perspective return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism - which is widespread - to the fact that courtesy will lead them to real cooperation.
"I look at all the events between the present and 2012 as a shadow box when the main events will occur in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the creation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters that helped to create it.
The Republican leaders are now at risk of expansion, they know that they must behave according to their promises and have to reduce government expenditure and to cancel the new medical law.
These lines are clear in the initial responses to the recommendations on deficit, which include tax reform and increase in certain taxes, increased retirement age and reduced expenditure.
The joint presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken as a task one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in their opinion, to develop pressure on deficits to the public programme, the ways that cannot be ignored.
However, they need 14 votes in the 18th membership committee so that they can present their plan as official recommendations and therefore fight to get as close as possible to that number.
The biggest resistance is among the elected jury officials who suggest that we have, at least today, small bases or will for compromise.
Galston predicts two stages in battles between the White House and the Parliamentary Republicans.
The first starts next year in the form of side conflicts when the Republicans call on Obama to solve the budget, tax and health care, when the period of greater side cooperation will be followed.
What causes the movement?
Public opinion.
There's a lot of evidence that despite partyness in the last elections, most Americans still want to see two sides working together.
If it could go to the pat, as it was in 1995, then both parties will be very carefully watching the public's responses.
Whoever's going to threaten the lowering of voices, he'll probably change the course and seek compromise.
It could be a optimistic view of things.
Participation and directives are today bigger than in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that there has been a larger ideological gap between Obama and the Parliamentary Republicans than it was in the case of the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as an advance to more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that appeared this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will cost a lot of effort on both sides to find common foundations in issues that still divide them.
The outstanding American document lies to Moscow as a shelter of corruption
The management of the city is in the hands of "kleptocracy" and it continues with parts of the bribes and bribes for the protection that come on the way to Kremlin, the US embassy in Russia in February records.
The police and the Federal Security Service are largely maintained by protective wings that help explain high cost of life in Moscow.
They choose money not only from legal trades but also from organised criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy -- which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "vertical of the office" -- will take his own when the money starts to move up the ladder.
The record sent to Washington, named Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on their website on Wednesday through WikiLeaks.
The record is based on the sources whose names have been modified.
The record was written at the time when the mayor was still Yuri Luzhkov and accuses him of a great share in corruption.
He was revoked in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but from then on, we can only monitor the minimal changes in the clearance.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owned a famous design firm, have been constantly denying the charges of corruption for many years, and won several charges for the wrong charges for such a claim.
In September, he said to the Russian television station when he was asked for a proven testimony of corruption, "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's bullshit."
The Russians with absolute conviction believe that if their company is corrupt, it will appear to be voted.
Of course, it is unusual to meet such details in such a way, in the embassy report, and it is also unacceptable that diplomats from foreign countries would do so.
"The government of the city of Moscow and its links with criminal foods led some to call it "disfunctional," and confirm that the government works more like kleptocracy than as a government," the report said.
"The Criminal Elements look forward to the so-called 'cresh' (the term of crime and mafia, which literally means 'the roof' or protection'), provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Interior and the Office of the State Representative, as well as everywhere in the government's bureaucracy of Moscow.
"The analysts also identified a three-step structure in the Criminal World of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is on the top of himself."
"The Federal Security Service, the Ministry of Interior and the Military are on the second degree."
"And finally at the lowest level, there are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill empty places in certain areas, as the city does not provide certain services."
The report says FSB takes money from the biggest companies and the police focus on smaller businesses.
One source said, "The owners of trade in Moscow realize that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of Interior (as rather than from organized criminal groups), because they do not only have more weapons, sources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For that reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer in the course."
The record says that while the selection of money is complex, the protection itself can already be troubled; even those who pay may be arrested sometimes.
For those who don't pay fast enough, their trades are closed under different reasons.
Medvedev talked several times about fighting corruption, but admitted that he made only a small progress.
The embassy report talks about men taking baggage, probably in cash, to the Kremlin itself.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucracies," Georga Satarov, director of the Moscow Research Team, said in the recent conversation.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It's not part of the political class because there's no political classes in Russia."
Without politics, no opposition, no division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that Russia's corruption is worth more than 300 billion dollars a year.
The country is ordered to 154. place in a recent study on global perception of corruption, non-governmental organisation Transparency International (the country is ranked from at least to the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the US embassy, which appeared in Moscow until late evening, certainly did not call on the Russian government anxiety, although only to the extent that Luzhkov could be accused of Moscow's deficiencies, it could be a possibility for Kremlin to argument in the issue of the problem.
In a CNN conversation with Larry King, Putin informed that documents that WikiLeaks published could have been fakes and responded angry to the statement that the American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth about the whole matter is that it is our mutual coefficient, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think that it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you understand, so non-ethically."
The Red Khmer veterans are forced to deal with the past
In an enlightened concrete tutorial with dirty and broken walls, the director of the school of Anlong Veng High School of the man who exposed it, the leader of the Red Khmers Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves The Moka."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "machine" for its severity during the Red Khmer government, he remains the commander in this remote country of Red Khmer in north-eastern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures and where thousands of former soldiers still live in this organization.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers gave up the government, there is a long-term loyalty in Anlong Veng.
In April, the victim in the forum of truth and reconciliation was allowed publicly to confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided books that explained the history of the Red Khmers and their former soldiers to children.
And in July, to bring together the UN and the Cambodian Court the first sentence of the former member of the Red Khmer, the sentence of the former leader, the notoriously known violent association of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit, to 35 years of prison.
With every such progress, there has been an inconvenience among the Red Khmer veterans in Anlong Veng, which complicates the attempts of reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into the Cambodia company.
"Mean former Red Khmers is anger and fear, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodia documentation centre, an independent organization that explores the regime.
"For them, life between Red Khmers was beautiful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the government of the Red Khmers in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, estimated 1.7 million people were executed or hungry, for illness or processing.
When the Vietnams attacked and dumped the government Pol Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodia border with Thailand.
There they began a rebellion that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were running party wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles in Western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated the advocates in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after the peace agreement, sponsored by the United Nations, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. The large groups of the Red Khmer warriors began to move to the government that had succeededed in Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died by natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who endured, was captured by government forces in the nearby Dangrek mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Peng prison in 2006 while waiting for the trial.
Their servants were no longer caring for them, most of the former warriors of the Red Khmers dropped into the ordinary Cambodia rural life, and many of them nostalgically remember the time of movement.
Although several elite Red Khmers maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak as unqualified farmers.
"These people had only a minimum benefit from the капitulation," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which runs a public forum throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
"They are surrounded by the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised without any idea of making trade."
Sor Lim, 55, who entered the Red Khmer as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before he settled as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under Red Khmery was good," he said.
"That Mok has eaten everyone."
"But now life is hard, because we have to ensure everything ourselves."
The trial of the Red Khmers also raised concerns.
At the beginning of the next year, the court will investigate Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of Red Khmer.
The Court has a mandate to pursue the leading submissioner and the people responsible for crimes, but it was not said whether it would also continue in four cases.
It was just not enough to calm the concerns in Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation focused on Im Chaema, 64, who was a regional leader in Banteay Meanchey during the government of the Red Khmers at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she was watching the construction of the trapeang Thma barrier, a project that probably killed thousands of forced workers.
Recent couple night Im Chaem returned from work on the field to her wooden house on a dirty trip outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to come down and shadow over the washed grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past between Red Khmers.
If the court called her, she'd refuse to go.
"In Cambodia peace is ruled and stable," she said.
"If another criminal prosecution is coming, there will be war."
The Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled from Red Khmers in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court would seek more suspects, although the experts and historians disagree with it.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But the conflict with the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
"Reconciliation in the Khmer environment means blinding broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so we can understand."
The Centre issued the first book approved by the government on Red Khmers, has 75 pages and the name "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four parties on Red Khmers.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng only knew few details about Red Khmers, despite the connection of the city with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, student at Anlong Veng high school, said that a new book helps students to understand the important parts of their history.
But his parents responded skeptically when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people will be pursued."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complex and more difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forum, the books and the courts are beginning to have an impact, and he's told.
Red Khmers still have a strong magic here.
Upstairs in the mountains of Dangrek Mountains is the road grown with a grass and bathed with plastic bags that leads to a circuit from the black seas covered by a creaming bowl roof.
The body of Paul Pota here was burned on a bunch of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile salesman on the edge of the road said he didn't know much about the man who was spoiled in that place.
"He has a strong spirit, many local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had her birthday and planned later to visit the place of rest of Pol Pot, where she would bring a bond of mature bananas in hope that it would bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to seem its weapons based on uranium
In the surprising victory in the campaign of President Obama on the security of nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government reported in the middle that they would surrender their stocks of highly enriched uranium, which is a critical nuclear weapons component.
The Agreement was published in a joint declaration issued after the Security Summit of the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Belarus Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
The American government has been trying to convince Belarus over the years to give up highly enriched uranium, and it seemed to have hit the stone of the injury last spring.
But American officials said The Washington Post that in the last two months, several secret operations were carried out with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons on the basis of uranium from the Belarusian research equipment.
This prepared the soil for the median agreement to remove the rest of the material - approximately 500 pounds, according to the official who spoke under the condition of anonymity, because it is a sensitive matter.
The Agreement turns out to be one of the most important results of Obamov 47th National Summit on Nuclear Safety in April, on which Belarus was excluded.
And it was apparently a good move to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the summit on nuclear security 2012."
"It proves that the process works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, groups supporting nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials throughout the world for four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of all their stocks of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be seventh.
Twelve countries have done so for the management of George W. Bush.
During Obam's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukašenko announced that his people would never give up their uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is basically the basis for weapons and less enriched uranium," then Lukašenko said.
"It's our comodity... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus has joined the United States several months ago and has shown its interest in reaching the agreement.
The first commitment to remove the Belarus uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly lighted, officials announced.
It was loaded on a special train which traveled more than 1,300 miles to the Russian storage and liquidation equipment, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and carried out by aircraft, the officials said.
The American government spent 13 million dollars on the programme, most of which to deliver a less enriched uranium for the production of nuclear weapons to the Belarus Research Institute.
"All was coordinated very carefully and controlled on the basis of confidence," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, official of the Ministry of Energy working for Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin Center for the study on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium used for the manufacture of weapons.
Belarus will, according to the joint declaration, seek to remove its stocks by 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, especially because of Lukašenk's cruel repression of human rights.
But the medium statement suggests the possibility of gradual drowning.
"We welcome progress in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that more consistent compliance with democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and is necessary for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government didn't do the ClA's dear flights
The Spanish government did not do precious things about the ClA flights transporting the Taliban prisoners and members of Al-Qaid to Guantanam through the Spanish territory, as the ambassador of the United States in Madrid expressed in his telegram.
This results from the documents provided by the Wikileaks server to the El País journal, where it also states that the first representative of the Prime Minister, Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vegawa, was asking for the Spanish executive to be informed and "to show that he has an appropriate supervision of foreign aircraft flying the Spanish airspace".
In June 2006, after the Communication of the Council of Europe, in which it was accused of a dozen States, including Spain, with cooperation in violation of human rights, a meeting between US Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fernandez de la Vegawa was held.
The Deputy Prime Minister said that the Communication of the Council of Europe "extracted Zapater's government from the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vegova emphasized that Spain has no problem with secret services flights across its territory.
"They just want to be informed," so that they are not "taked unprepared," Aguirre informs in one of the documents.
Also, the Minister of Foreign Affairs then, Angel Moratinos, appointed the US Ambassador that the Spanish government "wired to give this matter as low as possible, but by being in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited opportunities to influence".
In February 2007, Prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez informed the Ambassador that, if it concerns it, he intends not to block the judge's initiative to ask for secretion of the documents of the National Secret Services Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence for CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminated folder or any sensitive information," the Ambassador explained after the interview with the prosecutor.
However, the United States expressed concerns rather about "the obvious coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than the secretion of CNI information or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination among independent experts will complicate our efforts to address this case discreetly among governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, the Ambassador of the United States and the Minister of Interior, Alfred Pérez Rubalcaba, told the Ambassador that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he already instructed his colleagues, "to avoid excited comments with intention to reduce tension."
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the actions of the political party Partido Popular (PP; Czech People's Party - Rep.) in this regard.
"Despite its universal promeric orientation, our experience tells us that Partido Popular will not hesitate to use any indication that the Zapater's government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the US negotiations that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if this discovery could have negative consequences for the United States government," he notes.
A confessed mother-miller complained about the network of her mother's age.
A young woman talked about the baby when she was dead, and she had her blog, "Teror in Galicity."
Monica Juanatey Fernandez calls herself "Muki" online.
with this nickname she used from the early age, she communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; both of them are from the village of Noah in the area of La Koruňa, from which a young woman comes from.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand, it is necessary to know the woman’s emotional life that ABC journal reconstructs by means of witnessing her family members.
A thirty-year-old woman from Galicia entered the relationship with industry Ivan Tunez in 1998.
They went together for a year.
Soon after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if his newborn child was his, but his ex-girlfriend never let him do DNA tests.
Soon she found a new friend.
Her chosen was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their consumption took a long time.
Little Cesar lived with them.
When the girl left to the Balear Islands to look for work, the kid remained with her partner, who even arrived in Palma for a week.
However, from the contents of its communication, it is clear that the relationship has fallen apart.
In March 2008, she's alone on Manorca and says, "Alberto's some sort of mad that I left for work."
"When I told him, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes that he has to be with little all day and can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about the text she just got, "I want you to come back this month or give me the address to send you a child."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me to leave the kid with my mother, I'll take him when I get back," he says.
In May, he says he's coming back to his apartment, "I'm going to go there this week, but I'm only gonna stay until 19th, because I have 20 to go to work so I can't lose this place."
He explains that if everything goes well, he takes his son to his house.
"He will be with whom he is to be with, therefore, with me, and it will never happen again in my life that I would leave him with someone else but my mother," a doubtful purpose for her bad relationships.
There's another contribution in July.
The child that arrived on the island of the first day of this month is expected to be killed by 10 years.
"The Caesar is satisfied on one side, but he's not on the other."
"On the one hand, he's with me, and he likes it here, but on the other hand, he's going to school almost every day."
They're talking about moving to Mallorc.
"He's going to go to summer school, so I'll save some money for the nanny."
Seventeenth greetings and complaints.
"The big mouth of Cesar who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says that he sent you I don't know what kind of e-mail video he wants, look what he wants, he meets with me, sex is needed."
The thirteenth next report: "The boy is well, he's going to summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also a report about Victor, the current partner, "He's giving me money."
On the Internet, Monica's contributions are on the blogs dedicated to anime and manze.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she kept calling her "Muki ex-prison."
"The Terror of Galician (Motto)."
The last man with whom she lived, the guard, expresses her regret and feels guilty.
She doesn't believe everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica entered the province in Palma yesterday, where she arrived from the Centre for Liaison in Manorca.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, said that the defendant didn't remember how everything happened and that "she didn't intend to hurt a little man somehow."
Before she admitted that she drowned Cesar in the bath and put his body in the trunk.
Defense and prosecutor require psychiatric examination.
People would have gained 4 chairs in the House and PSC (Socialistic Party of Catalan - late.) would lose 9 mandates
With the results of November 28, the PP Party may have the main word in the Council in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the votes gained and the number of experienced Members during recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (Lid Party of Catalan - pp.) has already given the idea of general elections, whether or not, its prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes in the entire national elections is usually once in contrast with the catalan elections.
In 2008, the Catalan people received 610.473 votes in general elections, while the 2006 autonomous elections were only 316.222.
Last Sunday PPC (Catalonic People's Party) 384.091 voted.
If this trend of acceleration, supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP voters, the analysts of this party calculated that if the general elections were held, the PPC could receive 12 Members in the Convention compared to the existing 8, CIU (Convergence and Union, Czech Republic of Shoda and the Union - the Union) would also obtain 4 mandates (now they have 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 chairs (see 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia has a crucial importance for PP and PSOE parties (Spain Socialist Working Party).
According to this analysis of humans, the ERRC (Levic Republican Party of Catalanska - late.) would lose one messenger - now has 3 - while ICV (Initiative Green for Catalan - late.) would continue to have one mandate, if possible, another.
However, according to the election calendar, the nearest supplier will be held in May 2011 when general elections are available, where people can also have a decision-making impact on the end of the rule of socialists in four main provincial cities, as well as on changes in the Council of Barcelona (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the highest budgeted administrations - 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and humans agree with the possibility that the PSC could lose the city of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lerida and Gerona, where the socialists would not receive the majority, nor could they turn to their traditional allies, the parties to the ERC and the ICV.
In view of the debacle of the Republicans, it would not be possible if the party lost its representation in the Barcelona representativeship - as at least 5% of the votes should be obtained.
The PP Party has increased the number of votes gained in four main cities and could have a decisive impact in Barcelona, Lerida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the turning in Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP side before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lerida, PP received only 500 votes more than PSC, whose Mayor Angel Ross has very good relations with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign, they met at several occasions.
People have also received on other important councils such as Badalona, Castelldeels or Reus.
Currently, PP has a presentation at 34 councils in Catalan and would like to create candidates in as many communities as possible.
The Catalan cell provided an Al-Kaida organization thousands of passports
In addition to seven detained in Barcelona, three other in Thailand were detained.
Seven Pakistanians and one Netherlands who were detained by the agents of the General Information Commission in Barcelona, formed a Djihadist cell managed from Thailand, which organized travel passports to various groups of Al-Kaida, including "Tigers of Liberation of Tamil Lylam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", while the second appointed group was the author of the assassinations in Bombai, in which 106 people died in 2008.
The Ministry of Interior attaches an examination to this matter great importance, aiming to ensure through the " Кампai Operation" weakening of the Al-Kaida fake apparatus at international level and "restricting its operational capacities".
Investigators estimate that this cell could have been active within two years in Catalan, send thousands of travel passports to Thailand, then fake and then delivered to groups forming a criminal galaxy of Al-Kaida, so that their "fighters" could travel without punishment across the borders of Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active network of the GIHAD in Europe, and therefore these investigations, with the exception of Thai services, also participated by other European police units and cannot be excluded that in the next days there would not be any similar interventions in other European countries, such as the last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistanians Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Istikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) developed another in Thailand, where the Pakistanians were captured by Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thaicanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the men who were driving from Bangkok a cell sitting in Spain and other in other European countries.
The Catalan network, whose part was removed in 2009, stole particularly tourists travel passports that met Islamic requirements.
This means that the documents had to belong to men aged 25 to 45 years, had to be valid for several years and have been without visas.
In the investigation documents, it emphasizes that there are no facts that would connect from Catalan with the assassination in Bombai, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", should be one of the groups that accepted passports stolen in Spain and then fake in Thailand.
However, it is worth mentioning that a few days ago this assassination was sent from the Katalan transfer agency of about a thousand dollars that were "invested" to buy cards in mobile phones, which later used "command", which killed 106 people.
The police have already taken a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) requires Mass to stop the fiscal agreement
The President of the PPC Party (Lid Party of Catalan) Alicia Sanchez-Camach had yesterday the opportunity to give Arthur Mass its own conditions, under which he will be willing to support his introduction into the function of President Generalitat; these conditions are in line with those designed during the campaign and their priority is the recovery of the economy and deniing risk-related enterprises such as the economic agreement he wants to propose during his mandate.
The Chairman of the Catalan People met with Arthur Mass with the certainty of 18 messengers received in the elections of last week, which is more than satisfactory than to acquire a favor, so the CIA candidate needs at least one of the formations of the opposition to hold the vote on his entry into the office.
The possible conformity with the PP depends on the future alliance that the nationalists would like to maintain in the House when the general elections are held, but at the same time, the interviews that lead to Mass in these days with the remaining political leaders are carried out in the catalan spirit.
With regard to the President of the PP to obtain its support for the functioning, "he will have to end with all the sovereign and liberative speeches", as well as with the economic agreement -- similar to the Baskick leader of the CIU -- about which he even wanted to vote in the referendum.
Both leaders would like to scratch the reinforced political instrument of autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and donation taxes.
Details of the negotiations on Masov's entry into function will be dealt with within the PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised a strong opposition, Joan Herrero (ICV) and today meets Joan Puigcercos (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laport (Solidaritat Catalana).
The manager of the geriatric device assures that death has not occurred as a result of "death lack of measure"
The presentations of the Olot Centre do not exclude that their carer killed more than 11 clients
The leadership of the Gariatary Centre La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) provided a press conference yesterday to determine what damage caused the criminal behaviour of Joan Villa Dilmé, a carer who, while he was employed here, killed at least 11 seniors he cared for.
The director of this home for seniors Joan Sala has been delivered to an attorney attorney Joan Canady, and announced that "the wish of the home of La Caritat would be able to file charges against the guilty" responsible for killing, however, "law and responsibilities are obliged to leave this process to the competent authorities".
In addition to the damage to the good name that this institution may suffer because it has not discovered criminal activities of the guardian in time, the great threat to the home of La Caritat is now the requirements for material compensation that already calculate by the legal representatives of the families of the rest.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime has occurred in August 2009 and that he hasn't stopped killing since that time.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of the senior clients' home with suspicion that in many cases no doctor had seen the dead personally, but that, in view of the age and bad health condition of patients, everything had been resolved on the phone.
La Caritat yesterday, through its director, decidedly rejected this extreme and emphasized that "a lack of measures could in no case be the cause of what happened".
Legal representative La Caritat added that "in the case there is no indication that, with the exception of any third person accused, any third person would cause doubts."
The man now named "An Angel of Death" admitted yesterday 11 deaths and stated that the first crime was committed on 29 August 2009 and a month and a month and a half later killed the second old woman.
in this case, the death caused by too high dose of insulin, unlike the first case used by the mixture of calming tablets.
Director La Caritat stated that it is complicated to control the personnel's access to medicines.
Insulin and cocktail sedative were likely in six cases of nine means that this carer used to kill patients in his attempt to relieve them from suffering.
However, the analyses that are currently being carried out in the lab should show whether Vila is not lying and really seeking for his first victims less cruel death or killing them by using a lung, as he already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
in La Caritat, they do not believe in medical claims and do not exclude that the number of killers may be higher than what he admitted, and justify their behaviour in various versions that Vila has submitted to the court with awareness that he has to change his actions when it appeared to have killed eight people.
Therefore, they say that they want justice available to light the whole scope of this matter.
The European Central Bank threatens
The investors responded to yesterday's threat from President of the European Central Bank of Trichet, which warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The border diferencials have been closed by force and the shares of the European banks have fallen by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to make mistakes - the euro has just risen above the critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical for the non-liquid market, which, though happens to decline, is recovered -- but thanks to a short and very speculative position.
Investor's gonna take a while to lose his concerns.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us to retrieve the liquidity rate today, and tomorrow it will have to renounce the fourth in two years.
Bundesbank has requested the termination of the plan for the repayment of state debt for ineffectiveness and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures within the period and to keep unlimited access only for one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate to predict "minimum until March" and hold a three-month license with unlimited access to the end of this trimester to guarantee the liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue to purchase debts and even notify its intensity.
If it does not fulfil the expectations created, it will re-establish the response of the markets from yesterday, and if they continue blindly to download the liquidity rate, God with us!
It was the same at the May convention, where they claimed that they were not even considering shopping bonds, and there was a collapse of markets -- tomorrow history could be repeated.
The European Central Bank must be reliable and persistent.
In May, the pencil's fist announced it on Monday, and told on Wednesday that many of them were already purchased, causing another market breakdown.
Yesterday's shift rating for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of previous auction.
Thus, the rates in Portugal dropped by 30 points below, reflecting the change in the mood on the market that happened after Trichet.
In Ireland the numbers were published represent the losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent approximately 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15,000, they have the chance to become private capital by February, otherwise they will be declined.
Although Ireland has no credibility, since the problem has not revealed stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable under the subsidiary plan and will help to reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday the government will need the approval of the new budget by the Parliament, and there is still no sufficient support, so there will continue to be uncertainty in Ireland.
Angela Merkel reduced the tone of her speech to release the voltage in the face of the next EU summits held on December 14th, which requires political compromise to show that we are the Union and we are all on the same ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagnera, while others would prefer Beethoven's Ode to be happy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present a plan of action that would be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Retirement reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, employment recovery measures - to the ears of the investors it sounds like the four-year period from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish Storm increased by 4.5%, i.e. double than the other European markets.
Unlike February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish national bank was fast and persuasive - we are apparently obsessed with the effect of surprises.
Today we have a key accounting of the debt for three years, which will benefit from the Trichet effect, which, we hope, will be a great demand that will help disturb our refinance ability.
Request a rescue plan would be for Spain's self-wealth.
They would give us the cash we don't need - in El Tesoro there are 40,000 million in cash, three times more than in March - further high rates and market access would be closed to our son die.
However, the strategy of the Emperor's wife must continue to be used -- "not only to be it but also to seem".
We can do it.
The President of the Eulen Group will attack the negotiations of Vega Sicilia required by his children
The storm in an open conflict in the family of Alvarez, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro, is not silent.
David Alvarez, the founder of the group, will think of it after he considered it "very unsignificant", the legal proceedings of El Enebro, planned for this 16th month and required five of his seven descendants, where they should try to force their majority and benefit from Bodegas Sicilia's administrative authorities.
David Alvarez and his sons, Jesus David and Maria José, set up a legal group for their new chapter of arguing about the rule of part of society.
The founder of the largest holding of business services does not seem to be willing to dispute on membership in the governing authorities of the El Enebro Group.
of its Administrative Committee, five of its seven descendants, named transmissions during the meeting of the shareholders on 18 January this year and whose objection was filed in the Trade Register.
The Trial of the El Enebro Group planned for the sixteenth month, which was convened by the Trade Court No. 2 in Madrid, renewed the loon of the family of Alvarez.
The appeal to the judge is until the dispute is resolved by the only legal means guaranteed by the commission.
The last step Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elvira of the Alvarez Mezquires considers David Alvarez "the desperate means of his five children serving through a courtroom and a clear legal fraud for strengthening and improving the negotiations of January 18, which was completely inappropriate".
This argument will serve as a basis for justification of the legal attack of this proceeding as "too unsignificant".
The self-protagonists who are discreetly silent have already tried without success to summon the court in June.
in El Enebro, the group owning the other activities Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls seven descendants of David Alvarez 100% of capital.
However, the founder of the group, according to family protocols, requires the utilisation right to 51% of capital.
This issue is a key question that the judge will have to decide on the issue of the trial.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with secret weapons from Siemens
Software proposes improvement in vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull came into the Formule 1 series in 2004, his history in this unique speed world is characterized by surprise and success.
In the beginning, no one took too seriously the possibility of this new arrival team, and despite the rising trend of recent times, everyone was betting on the triumph of Ferrari Fernand Alons.
Without wanting to reduce the riding skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettela, or the Motor Motor Renault, which drives his car, in the world of Formula 1, a legend was born -- "the secret weapon", which the multinational Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to make him a victory team.
In fact, it is an executive software simulating marches that the German company has marketed in 2007 for very remote car sports.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design mounting lines in production races around the world, in energy races and for high precision devices.
Its goal is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is realized, thus avoiding useless mistakes and expenditure.
The PLM has facilitated the development of Canon, Sukhoi aircraft or the most famous use vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens Industrial Division, explains that the use of this software device has enabled Red Bull to perform "in a few hours, in almost real time" modifications and improvements that are otherwise detected during races and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992 the stakes employed average 10 techniques who were able to perform up to three or four improvements during one period.
in the Red Bull team is currently working on 180 young highly qualified professionals equipped with an executive information technology that analyze and propose every type of modification of racing vehicles.
The Chief of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyse and improve all the elements of Red Bull racing vehicles with the exception of the engine fully responsible for Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours through advanced production systems using laser and highly technologially advanced autocloses.
The only limit of this technical capacity is the amount of 40 million dollars representing the maximum which each team of Formula 1 can issue for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull organized about 50 km from London a high-tech race for design and production of its race cars.
It's two buildings in which visits are limited - especially for journalists.
Everything that happens here is considered "great secret".
The list of participating in this project reads 580 persons, including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull is in Formula 1, no doubt the fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
However, the other protagonists whose aid is invaluable, while no one knows them, are hiding behind the irrespective technological means that the sign of energy drinks has placed in their racing areas.
The Chief of Production Technology Steve Nevey claims that five years ago it was possible to say that progress in the research and development of vehicles contributed to the victory of 50% and the rest was the credit of the riders.
This relationship has now changed and technology is worth 85% success, while the pilots contribute from 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by calculation techniques because they are "unforeseen gladiators".
HP will establish 20 own trades within two years in collaboration with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in collaboration with her business partner Pont Reyes opened her first exclusive sale in Barcelona yesterday.
This company will be the first of 20 trades of 80 to 100 m2, which this transnational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These shops will also be located in 16 already existing commercial houses such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte Inglés.
The Spanish Vice-President of HP Helena Herrer presented as an example of a newly constructed sale to the Barcelona Gran Wia, belonging to Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been working for 30 years.
The North America company has prepared a plan for the establishment of 200 selling sites in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish trades.
The first sales were opened last week in Bucharest (Rumunia) and Belgrade (Serbia), a third trade in Barcelona.
Herrer didn't want to tell where other sales would be opened, however, she admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrer, who also runs HP staff systems, assured that the philosophy of opening trades will continue to be the same - using local distributors with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North America company here advises with an exclusive design of sales equipment (with products that can be interactively tested), which will be identical in Europe.
Furthermore, HP is also dealing with the security of trade staff.
Helena Herrer denied that it would be franchising, and stressed that the exclusive network of sales is intended to "be improve the customer service, services to small and medium-sized businesses in shopping, service, sales service and even packagings".
Business in Barcelona is part of the pilot pioneer programme at the world level, which aims to address the possible problems with computer devices in the guarantee.
The online service is connected to the technical centre in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"We will be able to solve problems in 10 minutes, which may otherwise take up to two days."
"This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and customers, since large companies already have a contract service technical assistance," Helena Herrer emphasized yesterday.
Sabadell's betting to steal a million clients for three years.
More optimistic than other bosses, a delegated member of the Bank of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be difficult for the bank, but rejects the new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of passive war.
However, it counts on the reduction of interest rates, which will try to compensate by reducing bank fees and credit prices.
Sabadell expects he'll be able to get a million private clients within three years.
Sabadell found a way to use the next three years and the power to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan for three years in 2011.
In addition to the survival without the need to turn to public aid in FROB, the goal is to acquire a market share by captureing a million new private clients - respective 700,000, if those who may leave the bank - because the constitution has been rather acquiring small and medium-sized businesses and large businesses than small clients.
This year the bank has already received 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share is about 3.5% private clients, while it is more than 10% in the company clients.
Another basic idea of plan 2011-2013 is the commitment to productivity, or can be said soberness, with a view to reducing the costs of which the bank will show the challenges when presenting the results during the period.
A few banking institutions are daring to set their goals and to publish them, since the financial crisis has changed all world banking plans.
Sabadell will close its Optima programme, established four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required extension for the next period.
Clients who leave their trustees will be their main target group.
At a meeting held by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "deep and very important".
He believes, indeed, that the journey from the crisis in Spain "will be long-term".
Furthermore, in two or three years, he added "very difficult to create employment", which is fundamental for the banking sector to survive.
And although he believes that the passive war - which reduces the margin - declines, the price of the risks that banks and competitors pay for their emissions to receive liquidity is already transferred to credit prices, compensating the reduction of the margins.
"The theme of liquidity and funding is structural and will be a pressure factor for loans."
"We haven't closed the corner yet, but the diferencials are very high," Guardiola recognized.
Banesto has already issued its networks on Thursday orders to reduce long-term loans and increase the prices of differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "now is reducing commissions", but there is a competitive framework.
The Sabadell's strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
It does not guarantee for free that Spain "will require greater size."
"The next year will not stay on the stone," he assured.
It confirms that capital needs are "properly reduced" and does not exclude that some Spanish institutions will enter between red numbers.
It also points out that FROB can complement the collection of funds on the market before the new capital measure.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, there is still a serious problem with what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but, unlike what was in June, it is possible to receive short-term funding through repo rates, which reduces the crisis.
CECA excludes another fusion wave
The Director-General of CECA refused yesterday that another fusion wave should be produced, and again insisted on the speed of the reorganization of the sector.
When the Spanish association process started, several institutions assured that this first phase would not be participating and wait for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta excluded yesterday that there should be a new wave of these operations.
"I believe that most of the fusions have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Civica group cannot be considered second round, what happens is the conventions."
"The majority is fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 constitutions we go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes are already finished and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has cooperated very well in this matter," said the Director.
In his statements at the ADEA meeting (The Association of Heads and Executive Officers of Aragon - late.) Olavarrieta pointed out that the concentration process is performed by "the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied as it appears in the payments of his time, not now, appeared in trade plans with the Spanish National Bank", he emphasized.
"Going from 45 communities with the average amount of assets of 28,000 million to 17 to 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to be larger and thus falling in accordance with the Basile Treaty," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a number of happy opinions on the shortcomings of the process", which show "a lack of seriousness and understanding", because "the thing the Spanish National Bank does is reminding us that we must be at the end of the year in time."
The Director-General of CECA José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain has the most strict financial system in Europe and "probably" both in the world, and those who question it, condemned "no knowledge".
The director noted that, in the current favourable economic situation, we can "be calm" about financial institutions and companions of the system that has managed the "very important" concentration process and continues with "a highest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spanish banking was very good from stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and Red German Lines
Berlin decided to maintain the euro, but set the conditions for the whole Union.
The tension on the markets caused a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from reducing taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises, by regulating private intermediary agencies or cancelling 426 euros for unemployed persons without doses, until the privatisation of 49% of AENA (Spain airports and air traffic management) manager Barayas and El Prat and 30% state lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgad, with the support of former Prime Minister Felip Gonzaléze, joined criticians to the address of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility for disturbing the current crisis.
How can we interpret this movement?
In advance, Merkel's opinion is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complicated process of re-determining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future is to be, which entails the idea of adhering to old traditions, which is held by a large number of other members.
The face of European resistance in Germany begins to speculate about three possible paths from the crisis.
The first represents a strong euro area that would be part of Germany, but also Austria or the Netherlands, while the Southern States would leave the currency zone.
The second is the return to the Mars - although now it can seem like a scifi, this version has wide public support, nearing 50% of the inhabitants.
The third option is, according to the German proposals for the processing of the euro with greater macroeconomic supervision, budgetary rigidity, penalties for the prosecuted States, possible payment delays for some of them, and by extending possible costs for regulating the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a while, so there is no space for the screws now.
First, in 2009, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission initiated deficits, the German Government pulled the constitutional reform from the sleeve to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first mark of the dispute between what Germany considered to be proper (fyscal strictness plans and public finance stability) and by practicing its European partners, including France.
The second showed this Mediterranean country when Merkel painfully stretched Greece's rescue decisions.
It was already the subject of a sharp criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion, which was also published, were strongly against the saving of Greece.
Finally, in the last October days, Merkel again appeared with a clear opinion when she demanded to reform the European Union's Conventions so that a Member State could be saved and that private creditors would have the obligation to bear part of the costs.
This opinion has been interpreted as an anti-European, since it has accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although somewhat mitigated, was approved, and during the next months we should monitor the Union reform process that should allow these measures from 2013.
Germany has a red line that is not going to cross.
And it tells us that, although it is now necessary to take measures that apparently disagree with, this date will be over with the old euro function.
The year 2013 will represent the birth of a new currency zone in which the violations of the rules will be severely sanctioned and they may be forced to announce payment delays, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany suggests that we must take a strict path of growth with an increase in savings and investments, moderate consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness and capital reserves.
Another option based on claims and construction, with enormous spaces in the payment balance, which was ruled by the boom growth of Spain, is simply not tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we would have made a mistake if we hadn't understood it.
It is not only a renewal of a public deficit of 3% in 2013.
What they want from us is much harder.
And the worst thing is, under these circumstances, we might be wrong ourselves.
I hope these current turbulences will arrange more peace.
And that we will use the opportunity they give us by spring 2013.
It appears that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this and his double statement (reforms promised after meeting with large enterprises from the past Saturday and yesterday's notification of new measures) thinks that, through criticism on Merkel's address, there was a way to think that things should be fixed.
However, the red line, which Germany has emerged, is here, and it does not seem to want to move with it.
And from the possibilities to be considered, the abandonion of the euro area full of too serious countries cannot be excluded.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sport and circulation of rules
The funds that Alonso and Ramos showed in the fight with Ajax, show a dowtyp not the intention of avoiding the punishment.
The alleged exclusion of the two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonsa and Sergio Ramose) in the Ajax League of Masters on 23 November resulted in the sea of ink on whether this is or not unporting behaviour and whether UEFA should not have both footballists been punished.
As we know, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team had clearly won) the nominated players were deliberately losing their time at the time when faul was to be played to provoke the judge, and it showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will fulfil the prescribed penalty in the next fight against Auxerre - and Real Madrid will end in their group in the head - and they will be able, rid of the cards, to continue to the next phase.
Finally, the EUFA disciplinary committee has given coach José Mourinh a penalty for two fights and the guilty players have received a penalty.
Provoking the yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but it is more common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, so rules that are not written but follow.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that her participating was the Real Madrid team (which in her hymnasm praises with nobleness and honor, and who has already condemned its players for similar acts), and as it appears, also by dramaticization led by Mourinh, which thus adds to his long history of the comediant and provoker of another episode.
In any case, the debate is about whether this type of conduct, which is not explicitly prohibited, is in contrast with the principles of sport, therefore whether the law is circulated by these acts; it is indeed an act that respects the sports rules whose sense, however, appears to be around.
Solving what kind of damage such acts do in a sports spirit.
One of the reasons for sporting behavior is the physical intactivity of the counterparts that were not broken in these cases, or there was no violent game.
Another of these features of a pure game is to avoid having players with their offences against the opponent's team of advantage - which also did not happen here.
The paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is, therefore, the fact that there has not been anything that we normally characterize as a forest or circulation of law, there has not been a hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behavior was to be as much as possible in order to receive punishment.
They waited, and they loved to get a punishment.
Another question, however, is, is what advantage the perpetrators of their deliberate offence will have.
Here it is necessary to establish that the rival does not get into a disadvantaged position and that the current match will not aim at any benefit, as the obvious result is that the team itself will have less players.
And it's not even a useful strategy for the next match, because the club will not be able to count with these players.
Apparently, the advantage is that players will begin another stage of the League of Masters Without Cards, which could endanger their participation in the future match.
However, it is a benefit from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of inadequacy, so the team may be eliminated at first sight and, in addition, the punishment players will be restored to the second round of cards, where one card is sufficient to be excluded less than the first round.
So as the wheels continue, it won't be completely clear if it's the advantage.
Simply and well, these negotiations do not go against the sports spirit, which is part of a strategic decision that allows for maximum benefit under the rules.
In the case of which we are dealing here, the players did not aim to avoid the punishment (as a clear case of rules), but rather chose when to obey him.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding punishment or fleeing it.
Although the limit between the type and the circulation of the rules is absolutely clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly a duty.
It seems to me that the dispute occurs for two reasons: because it was two self-exclusions and the way it carried out instructions to provoke them from leadership.
The damage to sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
A fight for Christmas parties in Barcelona
The calendar dictate concentrates the lavine of bookings this year on December 16 and 17th.
Fastly accompanied by the employees themselves who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like a Turkish honey or lottery, the arrival of December is again coming from pre-Day partys that are still acting as a oxygen bomb for restaurants and free time facilities in Barcelona, but the crisis has resulted in the fight against acquisition of price reduction clients: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros for food, the businesses and associations of this sector are in line.
To complete the complications of the numbers, he concentrated the calendar this year (when Christmas was on Friday) the request for a week since 13 December, which led to the reservation of days in the summit (16 and 17), while nearly no operation in the previous week.
As this is happening since 2008, when thin years began, many companies have cancelled collective parties for budget reasons.
In order to not leave traditions, many employees pay their own pocket party loss.
Regardless of the situation, many demand the prices at the limit of abduction, states the President of the Restauration Association of Gremi de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The representative of the patronate of restaurant facilities is not daring to predict the celebration this month.
"People will think well before they make a reservation."
"They want to go out, but as to the price theme, they are cautious," he adds.
Business will go well with those "all offering quality and good service at a favourable price," he says and recalls that through the crisis customers have the tendency to go down and most customers now want to spend about 25 euros.
A survey in various facilities shows that the largest effort of the reservation request is for the evening of 17 December.
The Soteras group reports a real boom booking for this Friday, most of which the requirements are up to 30 euros, allowing the offered menus whose total prices are from 25 to 30 euros.
in another important company that Andilana reads 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Funda, and other) has brought the speciality of the year’s calendar more early bookings since the beginning of November.
"We have made possible and impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menus, from which everyone should choose, are moving from 19.95 to 30 euros," they say.
In the AN Group, which belongs to El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and totally reads 23 businesses, remain optimistic since the second half of the year, and have relatively solid prospects for Christmas markets.
The sources of this company emphasize that 18 December will also be a burdened day, since there will be predominant celebration among friends.
In comparison with the last year, they added the Christmas menu to their six group menus, with the budget of 30 euros or more, because they recorded the trend of guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spain Wood wine - late.).
They also noted that companies who are calling their employees are already here, and it appears that the size of groups is a little bigger.
Vice-President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as Bar Association, Restaurants and Free Time Centre in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that he starts to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of bookings has "freeed" even though the clients "contract to the maximum".
The impression of the Christmas celebration has not been made, no matter who pays, it shows.
The Pakistan Nuclear Programme has produced a great dishes in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons "faster speed than any other country".
The Wikileaks documents confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
Contents of correspondence between the United States Ambassador in Pakistan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States published by Wikileaks portal confirms an extraordinary discontinuation in Washington in the Pakistan Nuclear Programme.
In addition to the explanatory and significant details offered on the content of communication and thoughts of representatives of the North America's diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries, as regards nuclear security, instead of increasing "is on retreat", and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other State".
The speciality of the Pakistan Nuclear Programme - that his weapons are not mounted, but are stored by works to disrupt their destruction in the event of attack - represents one of the main reasons for Washington's awake.
This calculates the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before visiting a national security advisor James Jones: "The nearness of some nuclear devices to the territory under the control of Taliban, the alleged distraction of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
Increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and the controlled fire programme is not observed by the United States, but also by Russia, as a spreading and representing reason to be careful.
"Pakistan had to hire a strict religious personnel to protect nuclear facilities; due to the decline of the level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programs or programs managed by fires," said Jurij Korolev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with their U.S. Protestants.
The biggest news documentation published by Julian Assange server is increasingly the lower cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the topics of proliferation of nuclear weapons and increased pakistan production of these weapons.
The depeses issued by the embassy in May qualifying to communicate with Pakistan as "frustrating", say: "Transparence often does not exist; aid offers remain without response or are rejected".
In the next report, Peter Lavoy, a national reporting worker for South Asia, says that "in spite of the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other state in the world".
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington to "be quietly supported by terrorist groups" during the visit of the Chief of the Army of General Ashfaq Kayani.
Go on to Chief Wikileaks
Obama appoints a highly built employee responsible for the fight against terrorism to avoid new information escapes.
Interpol issues a "red challenge" with a view to tracking and determining where Assange could be.
All about Wikileaks and his founder Julian Assange forms a complicated labyrint, where it is difficult to be sure of facts.
Interpol announced yesterday the "extreme challenge", so called red note, to "location and monitoring of the movement" of Assange.
However, it is not a classical order for detention.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but dates by 20 November.
And it has nothing to do with the last escape of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the charges of sexual abuse that Australian faces in Sweden.
Furthermore, a lawyer of Wikileaks Mark Stephens assures that "police know where and how to contact Mr. Assang".
It was on November 20, when the international police congregation in the French Lyon issued this order on the request of Sweden, but it was not published until yesterday when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 countries of Interpol have instructions for identifying or location of Assange "to put a temporary tie on it and issue it."
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of the person concerned with the red challenge, many Member States, as explained by the organisation, however, consider the so-called "red note" as a permitting arrest - this must be ensured by the national police - especially if States have a two-sided agreement on the issue of detainees, such as Sweden and England, where the Assange should be found.
This step frustrated Assenge's lawyers who published the writing yesterday, where they declared that the ninety-year-old founder Wikileaks was willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities through a video conference.
They also recall that Assenge asked and then received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case compared to the legendary Lavrentius Pavlović Berio, head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt, not a legal persecution," says the letter.
While the whole world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother protects his son's innocence - Assange is still in the unknown place, he is not silent.
On Monday, Skype provided an interview with the chief editor of Time magazine - in this conversation, he demanded demision from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United States of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out she was responsible for the U.S. diplomats' orders to conduct spying in the United Nations and to violate international conventions signed by the United States, she should resign," he said.
His view was rejected yesterday by the press speaker of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who qualified the demise requirement as "funny and absurd".
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who operates the website," CNN said.
The Obama himself committed a highly built employee responsible for the fight against terrorism, Russella Traverse, to avoid further escapes of documents.
The intention of the Speaking President Barack Obama to stop adding Assang to the importance of contradicting the views that conservative politics and comments in these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will be chairman of the Committee on National Security in the Lower Chamber since January, has asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to examine the possibility to include Wikileaks among terrorist organizations "to be able to intervene and persecute anyone who would financially contribute or otherwise provide assistance to them."
Tom Flanagan, a Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who said that Assange should "be killed", then had to renounce.
"Obama should write a reward or use a drone or something."
Whoever didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, baptist priest, former governor of Arkansas, and possible president candidate.
"Whoever is in the government, the person responsible for the escape of information has committed treason and any other punishment than the execution would be too mild," Fox station said
Puigcercos is searching for peace in the ERC by "powdering" at Caroda
The Republican leader will allow the parties to vote secretly on their endurance.
Huguet suggests more plural executive and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercos apparently found a prescription of how to combat the erectic internal revolt in the row of ERC (Levic Republican Party of Catalanska - late.) without result because of the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The Chairman of the Party is aware that his gesture on demiss seems to be inadequate to the former leader Josef Lluís Caroda-Rovira, and also knows that the impact of this sector is as weak as its leader himself, and that he cannot absolutely make him the kind of concern he had with other missing streams.
The leader of Levica will therefore try to get new criticisms by turmoiling that will help him turn to the general elections.
First of all, Puigcercos announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the whole state committee would be able to speak secretly to its resistance.
With the voting tickets, not by raised hand.
If Caroda's servants want to give a criminal vote to the President, they will be able to do without fear of remedy.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid breaking and faking his person.
In several interviews he claimed that he would not be considered confirmed with half the votes and one more, but he added, without specifying the percentage that it would also not be a good result "in Bulgarian".
Caroda's representatives require more than the president to give his function available - which they consider as a gesture that does not matter, since Puigcercos controls the biggest authority at the conventions.
But since they don't have the majority enough to force demises, they will try executively to remind the plan from now to May.
Therefore, they expect to participate in the drafting of a strategic reorientation document which will lead the national Council to vote on 18 days of the month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercose in exchange for this promise to move the Congress on autumn 2011.
The Leader of ERC declared that "multimobility" damages stability and that its goal is that organisations will be able to wash their dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
In this context, it appears to be an apparent article that current advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After taking into account Puigcercos' ideologist, this innovation advisor took it as a complete thing that the leader would be confirmed by "to exchange for several goals".
And he appointed five of them, of which two come.
The first is the "recompensation" of executives so that it represents at least 90% of members, which means to include new faces that are from the Carod Strip.
The second target can be a big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC fully ends with the meeting as an operational mechanism.
So he fights for the reform of the statutes so as to enable congresses to be held through the delegations chosen by vote.
The ending of the meeting system model, the exemption in the Spanish political party system, is the intended objective of the Puigcercos team that has fought in this direction at the last two conventions.
However, the 2008 gathering decided that the meeting must be assessed at a special convention on the reforms of the statutes.
This issue is still unresolved, as the situation inside the party was distinct from the solution of this matter.
Now, without the crucial sectors screwing, it could be an appropriate time to re-explore and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered per month of November; 390 per year 2010
According to MILENIO, Mexico declined by 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four less than in the previous month, as reported by the MILENIO journal.

Two days later, the bodies of two men were found with a wrapped tape, and there was a message in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
The report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations in which it was said, "This will happen to those who will not adapt."
in Ecatepec, two bodies were found to bear signs after torture and had tied ends, within a abandoned taxi outside the Centre of Justice in the San Agustin colony.
The last day of the month were found the remains of two men in Los Reyes La Paz and Nehaulcoyotl districts.

He and his agents found a ticket with a message.
China follows its goal to reduce glass gases
The representative of this country at the UN Conference on Climate Changes, COP16, assured that its country has developed extraordinary efforts to reduce carbon lead, and that it insists on its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will fulfil its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, assured Su Wei, the representative of this country at the UN Conference on Climate Changes.
In his first public performance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that its country has developed great efforts to reduce carbon trail and transform its industry.
He said his country has already invested $245 million in its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he realized that China would not change its goals and will continue to work with the international community.
He pointed out that the Chinese strategy for climate change is divided into these four items: dialogue, capacity building, building institutions and supporting pilot programmes.
In all these points, progress has already been recorded, including last year's approval of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he explained.
Furthermore, he emphasized that in China federal authorities cooperated coordinated with provincial and local authorities to achieve their objectives in terms of energy savings, effective use of energy and emission reduction.
Furthermore, as he communicated, various several-year plans have been completed, funded by both the Chinese government and the governments of other countries.
For example, it is stated that the Programme for Effective Energy Usage, which has been introduced over the past five years and has received investment from the United Nations, government and private initiatives.
The provincial project of climate change also runs, further the project to exchange lights for savings lamps and the project of mitigation and adaptation, has been set out.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the expert advisor of this country for climate change, assured that China's efforts were bigger than they generally thought.
For example, he calculated, the greenhouse gas emissions on one inhabitant represent 6 tonnes in China, while it is 100 tonnes in the United States; China is responsible for 9% of the historic share in emissions.
It has also developed unprecedented efforts in terms of energy consumption -- for example, it has increased 20% efficiency in energy over the past five years and expects further progress by 2020, he added.
Acted exclusion of Espina: Cesar Nava
National President of the PAN (Partido Acción National, Czech Republic, National Action Party) said that the former Chairman of this Party was entitled to demand from the National Regulatory Commission of its right.
The National Chairman of the PAN, Cesar Nava Vazquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientose was illegal and that the former Chairman of this party was entitled to turn to the National Regular Commission and to require its right.
In the interview which was issued before the objection by the Governor of the State of Gabin Cue Monteagud, he said that the exclusion of Espina is, in any case, a decision taken at the local level.
"It's one of the autonomous decisions of the Sonora Regular Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal in his case through a complaint to the Recommendation of the National Council in order to make a decision made by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that there is no time to think for 2012 and that she was never at the negotiating table on the presidential alliance candidature.
Nava Vazquez expressed his conviction that the PAN will come from the internal elections of the following 4th and 5 December, in which his follower will be voted.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is the subject which was never at the negotiating table, at least not so far, was the intention of local elections that had been successful and fulfilled its purpose," he stressed.
The President PAN said he was behind 71 years of dialogue, and therefore "we are not eager to be competitive, but we harden and strengthen us," he added.
He said that the Committee could be able to choose the best president or the president he deserved for the next three years of PAN, so he will hand over the chafet to the "who the committee determines".
"I am therefore absolutely calm and relaxed, and I will give to any of those five with pride the office of the President of the Party."
He foretold that the rise that the party recorded in July's last elections will be reflected in future clashes, although "there is no time to think for 2012."
"Now we need to escort governor Gabina Cue in this mission."
In this regard, he emphasized that these three governments, which have roots in the alliances in Oaxace, Pueble and Sinaloe will represent the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, since "their expectations and desires are put into place, and I am sure that Gabino is worthy of these expectations."
When we asked him about President Felipe Calderon's criticism by the Pri (Partido Revolutionary Institutional, Czech Republic Revolutionary Institution Party) for his four-year speeches, Cesar Nava called on members of the PRI to consider the six-year periods of former presidents Ernest Zedilla and Carlos Salinase de Gortari.
"If the Pri believes that the governments of Zedilla and Salinas were better than the rule of Fox and Claderon, let them start defending them to get out of their ultimateness," he said.
He said that the chief of the federal power has the right to express itself as he did during the National Auditory, since the country is not used by a loop or census.
Obama promotes the law on Twitter to support students without evidence
"If you believe that the approval of the Dream Act is correct, let your Senators know and insist that they approve this law," tweeted the American President on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization to support the law of Dream Act, which should legalize students without documentation.
"If you believe that the approval of the Dream Act is correct, let your Senators know and insist that they approve this law," Twittered Obama.
His brief report notes the Internet reference to a larger document that requests the public to connect immediately to the Senators, since the vote on this law is approaching.
"Because the voting is expected to take place soon, now the moment has come, let your opinion be heard," he pointed out.
The report was published after 42 Republican Senators threatened by blocking the approval of any law, unless extended tax reductions from the Bush era and government financing were approved.
Such blocking, notified by a letter signed by 42 Republican Senators, could affect the vote on the law of Dream Act and other projects, such as ratification of the new Treaty with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons, called START.
When asked about the republic blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the president's speaker expressed that he believed that once a fiscal theme was resolved, it would be possible to set up a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's still plenty of time left..."
"We all agree that we have to solve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe we can reach agreements in this matter at a certain point, and then we will be able to plan a series of other matters," he said.
The leader of the democratic majority of the Senate Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would request "vote to close the debate" on the law of Dream Act, so the proposal for legalization of students without documents could be voted in the Senate since next Thursday, although it is more likely next week.
The Senator's approval of Dream Act, or the law of "American dream" would legalize about 800,000 young people who had arrived in the United States prior to 16 years, stayed in the country for the past five years and were adopted to a higher education or military institution.
However, the advocates need 60 votes to approve the proposal, which requires assistance from several Republicans, so the organisations of its favourites carry out intensive agitation to ensure the approval of this law.
Democrats whose most Dream Act supports have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, expressed that he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support to this law.
Therefore, the representatives of the Dream Act need to acquire several Republicans in case other democrats decide to refuse the proposal.
Among the Republican Senators, with whom the senators are most negotiating, the Senators from Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as the senator from Florida George Lemieux, who complemented the mandate of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchson from Texas, but they declared that the next time they won't support him.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet expressed himself at this time.
Although the House of Representatives is attached to another version, most analysts say Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
with literature they put a finger in the wound ("poner el grandpa en la llaga", translated "possibly put a finger in the wound" is the period of the Czech "Back a slipper on the head - late.
The second round of the cycle Enjoying from the language was a dimension where participants presented literary gala presentation
"I understand the sex in language, but... the finger in the morning? What is expected from me?", asked writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round of pleasure from the language, the cycle that celebrates the literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used in this occasion as a sub-type (in the other branch at the round table was devoted to the the theme of Sex in language, explained).
The thumb brings us to the narrow in the morning, the Argentine writer said to the audience, mostly of the young people that met at the International Book Facility in Guadalajara, to hear this debate at the round table, modernized Marisol Schultz, and with the participation of Valenzuel, Sergei Ramirez, Mayry Monter and Louis Garcia Montera.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text which she dedicated to Gonzala Celoriu, and which Schultz subsequently marked as a great story in which Luisa played in the first person as a protagonist who was looking for the knowledge of the "ran" coming from a doctor to a doctor from whom she was not answered, even though the footprint of the same story yes.
The infector is convinced: "Trustence is not my strong side, maybe it's my wound."
Finally, after frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the road, he explained to her that the wound is not a scientific term, it's a psychoanalytic who reveals the secret: "The wound represents it really open and symbolic is a scar."
The protagonist sighed reluctantly and concluded that "a wound was able to learn only so much that it was really open and that it was not," but she had been convinced that the pleasure and struggle in the language must go together with her hand.
The writer Valenzuel played both of them.
Nikaraguing Sergio Ramirez also made a pleasant story called the Praise of the invention, in which no finger is named in the wound, but at one moment he will appear.
with the elements of magic realism, it tells about a famous witch who played the clouds, brings back the people who left far, or corrects the honour that one virgin lost, this story that then turned to talk to America, a great novel, in which his own chronicists who told him from the beginning, quoted Bernal Diaz del Castillo, who criticizes the exaggeration of conquerable captains.
"Cervantes, who invented all of us (writers), laughed at a finged testimony that was presented as real, but in other ways, it was never able to tell the story of America with such artificiality that even lacked shame."
Nevertheless, he emphasized, "they are fools and liars who have a larger fantasy" and just where the fact and the lie, where they don't know what the story belongs to one group and what the other, reaches fictional literature of their top.
It actually calls it "Cervant tradition".
"Thanking his reference, we have what we have."
Then Mayra Monter emphasized and commended the variety of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fact with its word Prst to the morning allowed.
The Cuban-portorian writer showed her finger on a huge injury of social violence that is passing through its country - and shares it in Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs close a quiet compromise, which is of course not intended," she said after saying that the reality of literature is communication and dimensions of compromise that is created between the author and the readers - and in their "chemical response".
The Spanish poet Luis Garcia Montero, whose performance also emphasized "to this finger in the wound of the writer bound by the writer".
He said that in the world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual habits and awareness control over the dogmatism, it is forgotten that "a little not hides behind each entrance, and there is also small yes."
"To be lorded by our thoughts and realities, we need to color: and paint means putting a finger in the wound many times and disturbing those who are much more comfortable, because they think in cartoons, black-white, in fixed ideas and without color, and also disturbing the authorities that prefer this black-white world," he said to support the sense of writing.
Romano goes after his first title
Ruben Omar Romano reads three defeats in the final, experienced good and bad during his career, but he had already achieved three occasions for a decisive series.
in the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the final, there are two different styles that highlight their techniques, teams that have a clear difference in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano reads three defeats in the final, experienced good and bad during his career, but he was able to achieve it at three occasions for a decisive series, but until now he left with an unconditioned one, and that's why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentinian must have satisfied with the silver medal, remained a step behind the winner and curiously played with the same team the next final.
As a coach, the Santistical Strateg reached its first final at the Apertura 2002 tournament, when he had the weight of the Morelia club, with which he was subjected totally 4-2 v. Toluce; then, at the tournament of Clausura 2003, he went back to the decisive duel and also lost it with a total score 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with the Santos Laguna tournament Torneo Bicentenario 2010, again against the "Devils" from Toluka, Ruben again suffered a defeat, even though his team played against "Universals" (hereinafter name of the Deportivo Toluca club - later.) after 210 minutes of the game undecisively 2-2, after a series of criminal shootings he got into the advantage of three to one and had two opportunities to seal the title, but finally his three players passed from 11 steps and then the team suffered the turn to 4-3.
Ruben has already lost two finals against the Red Devils of Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, and he could celebrate the title for the first time, even though he says he's the most important institution for him.
"I want to go out as a winner, I don't want to break statistics, this is for the club, for the passion I'm bound, and the title would, of course, be for me, but the first is the most important," the coach said when he was asked about the numbers that spoke in the final against him.
In a living memory, he has previous finals, in which, as he confirms, he has learned a lot, "we have taken a lesson that we cannot celebrate, we must be prepared for action, as well as players, because we have already been ready to celebrate, and I think we have learned in this until the game is over, we cannot celebrate."
It does not concern him that this series could be decided in criminal shootings, believes to its players: "You never try to reach a series of criminal cocks, you try to end up in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and it is necessary to be ready for it, in the last tournament we were prepared, but unfortunately, the fate has made us a bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, something left in us and hope that this time it would not happen."
Romano has a chance to stop being the other and taste the first glory that the titles bring.
United States amends the rules for visa sharing
People will have to turn to the center of Serviceb for visa applicants before interview at the Consular Division; costs will be lower and a shorter waiting time.
Since 10 January 2011, the process of visa talks to the United States Embassy and Consultants will be changed.
with a new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Centre of Services for Visa Applicants (shortly from English ASC) before the interview at the Consulary Division.
The ASC personnel will receive the applicant's biometrical information and they will be evaluated by the Consular Division before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages between the following:
The total visa costs will be lower, no longer will have to be paid fees for the agreement of the meeting, the second for the processing of the application and the other delivery of the transport service document.
The applicant shall only pay the only fee that covers all three services.
The current tariff remains unchanged: the amount corresponding to $140 for tourist visa, 150 dollars for cases of visas with requests (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visa for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to conduct an interview with a consular official, but only turn to the closest ASC where they present their documents and their fingerprints will be taken away.
Since biometrical information will be received in ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with the Consular Office, they will spend a shorter time here than in the past.
Similarly, those who will ask for visa in the Consulates in Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay extra fees for $26.

NASA announces the discovery of alien life
The U.S. Space Agency called for tomorrow's press conference to present an discovery that could cause a fracture in searching for alien life.
The National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm theory of the existence of alien life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 p.m. by experts on astrobiology, science that deals with study of origin, evolution, spread and the future of life in the universe, for a press conference in NASA's village in Washington.
When she invited the journalists, NASA assured that she would present "a discovery that would cause a break in search for alien life", which raised the speculation of experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures other than us, living in unhospitable conditions, which were considered inhabitable, and which could represent the possibility of one of them become intelligent creatures, such as humans, if they improve the conditions in which they live.
According to the appearance, it is a microbe found on the bottom of the lake Mono in the Yosemist National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered to be too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich on arsene.
The creature in some ways uses arsenic for its life, and this is what increases the probability that a similar life could exist on other planets that have no atmosphere like the earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms are using their metabolic arsenics, it will prove that "there is a different form of life, different from the one we know."
The Space Agency will notify the real range of discoveries for tomorrow's press conference.
The conference will be attended by the geologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of living on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who are studying Titan (the largest month of Saturn) with the perspective that his chemical composition is similar to the earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencies and Patron produce the opposition "block"
The Constitutional Law Reforms lead to the arrival of bipartism, they declare.
The 60th parliamentary period has not even been launched in Congress when the opposition block (Partido de la Revolution Democratica), PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech, "Strana of Work" - recognition), Convergency (Cheese "Shoudo".) and Jesus Manuel Patron Montalve, who declared himself independent and these four discussed one thing: the arrival of "bipartism" to the House.
Before the beginning of the meeting at the beginning of the 60th parliamentary period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PRD and Patron Montalvo "greamed" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, as it expelled them.
This reform, they repeated, begins with "bapartism", because it will now be two people from the same number of parties who will control the Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, the coordinator of the PRD party, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López British by PAN (Partido Acción, Czech Republic "National Action Party" - late.) and Luiz Cardenas Fonsecou as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms are institutionally forming political marginality from the PR (Partido Revolutionary Institutional, Czech "Revolutionary Institution Party") and PAN.
He stated that during the next days they would speak to PAN and PRI representatives to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not, they will again be subjected to these two parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
"When I came (the opposition coalition), I look at it, because we are excluded from any decision, they are not even willing to consider the opinion of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence stated that the PRD, PT and Patron coincide, and therefore they will form a plurality group.
It's impossible to allow, to continue Congress after the monopolity, to be "duple".
The aspiration of law reform is not to be an endless bipartism in Congress.
This group begins with five legislators and its members now talk to other colleagues and colleagues to obtain more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT explained that Congress currently became a "utilities" of two - in the page of PAN and PRI.
"Only one side once controlled it, two today divide it."
Patron Montalvo asked for respect for the messenger's personality to be given a place at the work table.
"To be five of us who are likely to be nine, but now see us at five, not because of the slaughtered agreements outside, each in another fraction, we are united to find a place at the work table, because the problem is that in the reform they have created and consented is we stand out, and we do not agree with this reform."
Another 200 thousand pesos is issued for "supplier"
The City in Mazatlan will pay another check of the company's owner of electricity.
Another check for more than 200 thousand pesos was sent by the council to Lorena Guadalupe Camach's Palazuelos.
This amount paid in this second half-year owner of the company, suppliing electric material, will climb to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the corporate transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was sent on 16 November this year, exposed to 200.144.56 pesos and as its subject was stated "reparation of unsaved payments".
Box Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality would pay this supplier, which was monitored by the Supreme State Audit Authority for sale at a high price, another sale.
What was not said is a total amount that the city still owes to her, and how many more checks will be sent for Camach's benefit of Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been purchased now, only what we owe her, as well as the other suppliers," he said in a conversation.
The last checks appeared in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two days 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last November.
While this entrepreneur has not yet been published in the Government's Charter, as it provides the law in the case of companies verified by the Supreme State Audit Authority to prevent their services from using other administrative authorities, the treasures have ensured that the service of the board provider has not been reused.
In the previous period, after 25 July, Noroeste published a revision of the checks issued by his council, which revealed that between March 2008 and 9 July 2010, during the three-year period of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sanchez, the city of Camacha Palazuelosa paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 checks.
It also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where it incased checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need maintenance
Tourist managers complain about the accident of a foreign tourist about the bad status of the Sanchez Taboada talk in Mazatlan.
After the fall of the foreign tourists into a deeper area on the Sanchez Taboada seat, the tourist sector in Mazatlan requests the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in bad condition and not show the port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Zone Dorad Trade Association, recalled that they repeatedly asked for the impression of the destination, and the bad things the tourists find here to replace with new activities or routes.
He stated that the bad state of the streets and walkers is affected by tourists walking and seeing a mess, which adversely affects close businesses.
"The police don't know what it's like to close a business for one day, and they have no idea of the salaries they avoid, otherwise they wouldn't deal with these matters so long and without proper planning."
The hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sanchez said that the tourist's fall caused lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the city.
"The Council will have to take responsibility and avoid repeating such a thing, it will have to be committed to preventive maintenance, not only to fix existing obstacles," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, we should be maintained, because even as residents we deserve a clean place, the city should change its urban maintenance strategy."
There are also other places that seem negligible and poor, such as Mazathlan Emblém and El Venadito (monument, jelene statue - p.p.).
"Tourists today, not only depend on promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, that is, a city swimming with pureness of their beaches and streets, where there is a permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"The attention needed was here, and these facts emphasize something that is well-known, the maintenance is missing.
He spoke of a number of places to be arranged in collaboration with the council, he said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and okay to be attractive because he has a tourist potential.
Raoul Llera Martínez, a sub secretary of the Tourist Promotion, said that saving tourist sites in Mazatlan is immediate because they are not correctly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural goals and spaces, however, which will need to be arranged first to bring these places into the list that we have to promote this destination."
IP requests the results of the Congress
Eduardo Davalos, President of CCE, would like the Members to take great responsibility by taking an example in searching for better Sinaloy, in various challenges that the State faces.
The parliamentary period full of dignity and without agreements between the parties and the State execution requires the business sector in Mazatlan, because Sinaloa is disturbed in screams and faces major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary period, composed of seven political forces, 19 Members of PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nuev Alianza, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergence and the last of the PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from the new members of the Congress is to be able to implement good leadership, commitments to society and to different areas that require responsible legislative work and that the same parties and patriarchs will not be repeated.
Eduardo Davalos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), suggested that the recently elected 40 Members of the Congress should take great responsibility and follow an example on the way to better Sinaloa in various challenges he faces.
"We expect the Members to actually exercise their right, without agreements between parties, because they usually do measures to promote their own interests and become the carnivals of rulers and leaders of parliamentary fractions."
He therefore said that the obligation to establish the necessary curse should be confirmed, which would move the ruling forward according to the order.
"We want them to do a dignity job and to be bound primarily to companies and sectors, because they were the residents of Sinaloy who gave them their voice in the previous elections of confidence."
José Ramon Manguart Sanchez, President of the Association of Hotels Tres Islas, expressed that one of the largest challenges for 40 national representatives would be to collect all the powers to achieve the economic growth of the country because the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is to incite economic growth to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will support the creation of jobs in a certain way."
With regard to the travel movement, he asked new legislators to give him greater weight within the state budget and to support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that this is the Ministry with the second lowest budget, which is unreasonable because it is important economic activity, bringing currency and investment, which is also directly competitive with agriculture."
Furthermore, in order to issue funds for launching tourism projects, Congress should help to add the state to security and help with the alcohol law that has not been resolved during the previous parliamentary periods.
Three Kings are looking for
Dolls, cars and wheels are along with other toys on the wish list of children in the family of Coronad Valenzuels.
For their parents, the coming holiday of the three kings will be difficult to fulfill their imaginations, since their household reads exactly 12 people and one lamb.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose their hope that Caspar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them toys and clothes that they want so much.
The family lives in a humble accommodation in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, since his father has no permanent job.
"Something we have a hard time, because my husband has no luck, but we're selling mandarins and potatoes... and I'm dating "plebeans" on the street afternoon to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuel Andrade, the mother of children.
Four-year-old Adelaida wishes a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like Barbie's doll.
With regard to the ten-year-old José Alfred, he would have wanted a monster car for a while, and for his eight-month brother, Jesus would wish Cayetana's clothes for one year.
"He told me (Josee Alfredo) "I wished this monster car," but I told him, "We'll see his son," because it was very expensive," he remembers the sadness of Cayetana.
For the older children who were just at school, it would be perfect clothes and shoes.
Maria Guadalupe, which is 11 years old, has size 12, ten-year-old Isaias size 10, where an eight-year-old Miguel wears size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan is missing his tennis, so he would need a couple of sizes five and a half or six.
To help meet the dreams of children from the family of Coronad Valenzuels, you can attend the campaign "The three Kings are looking for" and bring a gift or money in cash on the reception of the Noroest journal.
14 alleged drug dealers arrested
The dozen of examinations were carried out in Estria, Wednesday, under the liquidation of a network for production and sale of Indian cannabis.
14 people were arrested and faced by different charges.
The surveys took place in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that served to produce drugs.
"Now about 750 troubles of Indian cannabis, four pounds of hashish, money and equipment that served for production were taken," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, speaker police in Quebec.
A total of 11 men and three women were arrested, both of them assuming heads of this whole network, two men from Sherbrook.
The arrested persons had to enter the sherbrook courtyard after they were arrested.
They could face charges of the production of Indian cannabis, its holding to trade with him, conspiracy and stealing, among other things.
These surveys took place after a long-term investigation, which took almost a year.
"It was the information that we received from the public and which allowed us to join these arrests," said M. Ruel.
This police operation took part in 70 police officers of the regional investigation office of the city of Estri State police of Quebec, Sherbrook and Sherbrooku Memhremagog.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without problems.
The draft law of conservatives who, according to the government, should regulate the problem of ships imposed by illegal immigrants, will clearly be overcome , while all three opposition parties in the middle have not been able to support it.
"I'm based on Chart."
"I stand directly on the side of the party that built a jula under your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of Liberals, surrounded by the Members after the weekly meeting of the weekly du caucus.
Liberals insist that the draft of the law, as designed, law that would allow any person from the ship identified as a ship transporting illegal immigrant to violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The boss of the quebeck Block, Gilles Duceppe, also stated that he could not support the bill because he was headed to the wrong goal.
"We are against and all opposition parties seem to be opposed, so we will see what the government will do," said M. Duceppe.
The NPD's criticism in the issue of immigration problem, Olivia Chow, rejected criticisms that want her party not to be strong enough about illegal immigrant.
"Neo-democrats agree to take measures against illegal immigrant transmitters, and this is what we consider to be a portion of another law proposal, C-35," said Mrs. Chow.
"We do not support the law of the Conservatives because he blames refugees and puts children in jail for at least one year," Mrs. Chow explained.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties.
"The Canadians inform messengers that they do not tolerate this type of illegal migration, these criminal operations that they take Canada to the mushroom and treat it as a patolizale."
They expect Canada to take consistent measures, responded Minister Kenney.
The government has not declared a vote of confidence in its draft law, which could lead the country to the elections leading to its rejection.
One conservative said to the Agency QMI that the government would ask for a vote that each Member who was against would respond from his position before its voters.
New unity does not mean unanimity
Despite notifications, the possibility of creating a permanent unit for the fight against corruption and collusions, many observers continue to require the creation of a public investigation committee for this problem.
The Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, strives to avoid forgetting this idea: Québec is going to consult with the Department of Investigation from New York in January next year.
Metropole has a permanent anticorruption unit available since 1870.
That's why the Tuesday notification of not one of us surprised.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Constant Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
Moreover, it was not necessary that the public security criticism, PQ Stephane Bergeron, evaluated this notice as "the rabbit pulled out of the hat" and "amateur solutions embedded on the knee".
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"They will be satisfied with the confirmation: you will see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For President CSQ, Réjaan Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of an interrogation of witnesses in the public receipt.
"In addition, Mr. Charest claims that he does not want to create this investigation committee, and people think, like you and me, that he's hiding something," he explains.
"The only way to achieve the creation of an investigation committee is to demise Jean Charesta," explains Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and politology in the Institute for Education of High State officials.
In order to be able to get out of this blind street, he proposed Quebec to give special power to the General Inspector so that he could investigate the collussion and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the General Inspector," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same power as the Commissioners whom they allow to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the Charest government's records.
Quebec would also after Ottawa to change the Criminal Law so that he would be better adapted to this type of criminal activity.
This requirement would come from an author for operation Marteau (Kladivo), who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marca Fourniera that the judication of this type of investigation is not explicit.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some amendments related to this record.
During the surgery of Spring 2001, which affected the biker group, although the Penal Code has not yet been modified, 131 persons were arrested.
Ottawa then made changes in the gangstership law.
The rivers are under strict supervision.
Several water streams have been under strict control due to strong crashes falling from Tuesday in several regions of the province.
Wednesday afternoon, in Shawinigan, Mauricio, there was a soil sewage.
Two houses were preventively evacuated.
At the evening, there was another landscape in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The road's out of the way.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions of strong collapse, i.e. rained from 40 to 70 milimeters.
Between 20 and 40 millimeters were not expected from today to the fourth evening, according to regions.
The sections in the north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley have been most affected.
It could fall up to 100 millimeters.
If we combine these snowfalls in some sectors, we can be afraid of floods in some water flows.
The Relief Service of Quebec announced a warning on Wednesday night against the danger of the flood for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in Lanaudière.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jerôme, in the forest Laurentides, and in Chéne, in Lotbinière, became subject of flood emergency and continuous controls.
In the area of de Lanaudière, some lakes, Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, were caused by strong collapses of divorce, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a provisional bridge was cut by strong rain.
Two residents must have been preventively evacuated.
In Outaouais, some lakes from the shores have caused the closure of some roads, especially in the town of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The rescue service is emergency and supervises the situation in this area, said Annik Bouchard, a Security Advisor.
The Quebec Centre for Flood Prognosis issued in the middle of warning against strong floods for several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
The Quebec radio moderator Stephane Dupont suffered partial non-darm from the Canadian Radio and Television Council (RRTV) due to controversial statements relating to social assistance and the Haitians and, as well as due to a gross expression during the broadcast.
The Radio and Television Council believes that Mr. Dupont and his group of CHOI 98,1 FM had the right to express their views, but some of the statements contained "incorrect information on social assistance and the inadequate negative exclusion of the Haitians of gross expression which does not correspond to the transmitted daily".
The Council also concluded that the debate on suicide, including the broadcast of the name of both persons who have taken their lives, did not break the rules for radio broadcasting.
The Radio and Television Council received several complaints on comments made during the broadcasts sent between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after the complaint of the Joint Front of Contributors of Social Support to Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts referred to in the broadcasting were inaccurate.
Moderates must provide reliable information, not fake.
Regarding suicide, moderator Stephane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of desperation.
Most of the members of the Commission concluded that the transmitted report was such that suicide cannot be considered as a solution to the problems of daily life.
"The majority of the Commission believes that the controversial episodes of "Dupont's afternoon reports" have struck on a delicate topic in an impartial and appropriate manner."
No lift was raised against him.
The last dispute was related to the statement followed after the Haiti earthquake.
Stephane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were therefore in media shooting, which caused many reactions.
CHOI moderator declared that he did not send any gift to help the Haitians because we can't be sure that the needed money will actually be received.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unauthorized, but that their cumulative effect creates an inappropriately negative image of the Haitians.
"I've already launched my classroom delay of this thing."
"My record is not touched for a year and a half," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use the broadcasting of rough expressions.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio has cooperated "on the framework of its obligations".
For a station which, inter alia, will have to notify this decision once during the main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King du kung-fuvaa Montreal.
The inhabitant of Montreal, originating in Algeria, Nacereddin Earthal, has a extremely special progress.
The atlet that comes up in "sand" (kung-fu "full contact"), in kickbox and Thai box, enters the dads and rings of the world and seeks new challenges.
"I started fighting arts like kung-fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria, I explained the Earthal, who lives in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for fights somewhere, because for those who don't like the game on the ground that appears in fighting sports, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, this man who works as security and as a assistant for UPS has just added bad news to his competitors when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edimburg, in Scotland.
"I won kickbox category full contact and Thai box, he said."
"I am currently preparing for China for the World Cup in the dream show."
"The rivals were invited to end up with the first four at the last world's championship in each category."
"In Toronto in 2009, I won a bronze."
"In 2005, I ended eighth in Vietnam."
"In 2007 in China, I ended at the tournament on the fifth morning, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished the third, added."
"The interesting thing is, in every competition, I have made some progress."
"I'm going to be the first time this year or the errand!"
"San Shoe" or "sand" is a discipline originating in China, where the hits of hand and legs, as well as throwing on the ground, are allowed.
The fights occur traditionally on the platform and rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, arising from this form of battle, is the American of the Vietnamese origin of Cung Le, well known in the world of battle arts.
As long as Nacer Earthal will keep one result in his career, he will confirm his courageous participation in the "King of Sanda", Super Bowl in kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains a sympathetic boy."
"It's kind of equivalent to Stade Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Earthal won his first match, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before he suffered the loss in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real professional, analyzing."
"There are four rivals in category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals are facing the final of their category."
"Then the winners of every category will be slaughtered so the only champion, King kung-fu can be crowned."
450 contracted million without public competition
Hydro-Québec agreed after a mutual agreement of 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the heart of this lavina, more than 100 contracts is just a consortium created from BPR, Dessau, SM Groups and Axor, which received the most important contract, the entire project's management contract of $295 million without a public competition.
This consortium, named ENERGIA GERANCE, was authorised in 2004 coherently with the choice of Hydro-Québec to confer its responsibility to the private sector for the management of this important hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the "Energie Gerance" consortium won a lucrative contract without any public competition.
For the Quebec Party, the complaint on the consortium of businesses has a serious problem of ethical nature that risks the exclusion of competition and raises prices.
"It's a new way to carry out the collusions and eliminate competition."
"That means that people, no longer making side deals secretly, are already being done open today," PQ Sylvain Simard said yesterday at the press conference.
Something earlier, in the morning, M. Simard asked this question to the National Meeting, because he said it was difficult to bear how public interest could be sold in such a way.
The Ministry of Nathalie Normandeau suggested this afternoon, suddenly denying that it would be a collussion contract.
"I have my own way," she bunched and claimed that PQ was "unfair" and "missed accuracy."
She said "that would be the least" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for the creation of consortion is common practice throughout the world.
It is usually an alliance limited in time that allows two or several companies to compile their mutual expertise so that they can respond to the call for offers to a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the volume of work.
The building is already running and must be scheduled until 2012.
However, the contract was confessed without the competition; it was a trade.
It is also necessary to acknowledge that the consortion formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, nor in relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir discovered last week, the formula for consultation in engineering is the subject of the government's investigation.
If we fly fast the trade register of quebec companies, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortions, while some appear to be created.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; let's name CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal person, and that's Dessau.
With regard to the consortium of Énergie Gerance, Minister Normandeau stressed in particular the fact that "the land of La Baie James is a typical special dynamic of working forces and that Hydro-Québec has responded to it since the 1970s".
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, from the Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that will make us face over the fact that the project management contract was concluded after a mutual agreement.
"If you go to a public competition and if there are few participants in the competition offering, your offered prices can be higher."
"You have two choices: that you will take people who make the procurement participants and say, "Let's make a deal satisfactory and with a good price."
"But the main idea is that it is not an important price, but the competence of people," Mr. Laporte confirmed.
This contract granted to the Energie Gerance Consortion is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000 that received the Quebec Party.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ on the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 contracts for consultations in the field of engineering, concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories conducting soil sample analysis.
SNC-Lavalin grabbed 22 contracts, of which Génivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without having a share in "Energie Gerance".
All contracts were closed.
Together, they read 449 783 344 dollars, including the contract with the Energie Gerance company at $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard pointed out that four companies that are part of the Consortion (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very good friends of the Quebec Liberal Party".
Minister Normandeau has released a report that PQ is also connected with companies that "fund her" before she stated that it was more about her management workers.
The barometer of responsible consumption - "green" label does not raise confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in the players of sustainable development, but also in "unpartial" marks and ecological certificates, in order to follow the selection of products.
The worst is that, even though we're swimming in the media universe, which insists on us and calls for more socially responsible consumption, this media universe renounces the lack of credible information, non-compliance with the obligations qualified even as a brake for its commitment, Barometre states the responsible consumption of which the first article came out yesterday.
While consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, the Quebec people who are trying to sell them, they still don't trust them too much
Two-thirds of us actually say that they don't trust the promises of environmental companies, just because the green advertisement by companies is investigating the measuring tool that the Observatory produced by the Responsible Consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the validity of official certificates attached to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and labels that are labelled as ecologically responsible, states Barometre.
Similarly, the policy debate on this subject is accepted as serious only 14.6% of Quebec's population.
The information on responsible consumption seems, however, primary to stimulate the consumption of almost a third of the Quebec consumers at present.
Indeed, vacuum and doubtful nature of information would mitigate the excitement of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake he identified by Baromètre, at the higher price of these products.
Otherwise, a third of the inhabitants of Quebecus build untrusted data on products or "green" services that we seek to let them pass by our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their customs and especially to change the mark of one or more products, thus responding to their convictions.
The whole 61% of them preferred shoppings in their quarters and preferred the shopping of foods raised in their region, says Baromètre.
More "green" and responsible - the accountable consumption index has reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumes Québeku prefers to present itself as a king of recycling, which seeks the least impact on the environment by caring for animal protection.
But their social and ecological conscience is obviously left somewhere outside their car, says Baromètre: in 2010, only 28% of the inhabitants of Quebec said that they use a bunch of transport or that they recommend the use of a car to drive at least two persons, in the interest of the protection of nature.
The walk and bike also supported 39.1% of the participants of this extensive conduct research that used this cliché.
Loan of the state to buy the kin complex eXcentris
The government of Quebec, which we asked for financial participation in the purchase of the kin complex of the eXcentris Company Angus et le Parallèle, agrees to participate, but only to the sum of the loan.
The Developer company "Angus et le Parallèle", which sought a gift of seven million dollars from the Minister of Culture to buy a movie complex on the Saint-Laurenta Bullar, and who proved her mission as a film art lover, did not obtain what she wanted.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but under its own conditions.
Rather than the expected gift proposes the Government of Quebec a loan, which would, in the end, be lower, some original expectations that could build a foundation for life-sustainable solutions under the advantageous conditions and with sources originating from the state.
The first action plan and demands for 12.8 million have already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications have already been revised to reduce.
The draft and action plan has been sent to the Minister of St-Pierre, President of the Cultural Development Company (SODEC), François Macerola, who runs the movie project eXcentris.
The final message was sent ten days ago.
But the government's opposition came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have time to answer by 31 December.
However, the hypothesis of the gift from the state must seem to be rejected.
Recall that the Association of Owners and the Quebec Kinematographic Centres has been constructed against the direct investment of the State in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, considering that the Minister of Culture should not finance the project on real estate if he did not do so for other kinosals.
However, several participants of the discussion were demanding essential economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into his film space for ten years of film art after he financed the construction of the complex itself, which could be the reason for changing the financial council of the State.
The lack of rooms for independent films is screaming in Montréal, and eXcentris was able to get a permanent clientel.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini in his head, runs a campaign for releasing funds into the private sector, in the belief that he will buy $700,000 for pushing the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of three film companies, Le Parallèle, continues to distribute movies for eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen all three rooms on 27 February next year and project the most beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir, so he ignored himself, so he and his group thinks about the suggestions of the reductions that he has done to him.
The tire raised for Canada as a whole...
The new diplomatic sources referred to in WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers as a complex of the smaller value of the Canadians against the Americans, but as a strike, they express their feeling of superiority to Canada.
The American diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian voter lies on the heart of the Canadian-American relations when he goes to vote, and believes that the visit of President Obama has helped the conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
Four new reports, including an American embassy in Ottawa and Washington yesterday, presented to the public, provide more sensitive details to get under the skin.
The Communication on Date 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, detailed the point where the United States are not part of the bets discussed by political leaders.
To the great impression of the American Ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides a few explanations to this situation.
"The Canadian complex of minority, almost incorporated, may mention political leaders to talk about internal bets, rather than to realize that these elections relate to the United States (as in the free trade campaign in 1988) ", he writes.
"The United States are therefore," he concluded, "the pronuncial elephant in these elections: everywhere present but potentially too threatening to speak of them."
The Ambassador understands this "deep silence" less that both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of candidates, parties, or even better the boss of the party to run these important relations should be the key factor that voters have in mind when they go to elections."
Other expressions of this feeling of importance can be read in the report sent by Terry Breese on 22 January 2009, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your way will help to ensure that the government remains trusted at the beginning of February, as regards the federal budget, which Canada will publicly acknowledge its first deficit in more than ten years, due to the renewal plan of 30 to 40 billion dollars," says M. Breese.
None of the mention that the government had to postpone the preliminary meeting of Parliament so that it could not be defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties undermine their survival by the quality of the proposed renewal plan.
Another report from January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, tells Washington about the increasing negative image that the United States is throwing dramatic series to CBC.
The Ambassador is concerned about the broadcasting of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which not too fancy links to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or for kidnappings for the purposes of violent interrogations in the ClA.
Another report refers to the fact that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner whether Europe is ready to accept certain prisoners from Guantanam.
Mr. Kuchner answered yes, but on the basis of the principle of "fact from the case".
At the end of the meeting, it says, "he handed a paper about Omar Khadr, 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, state secret."
"The secret accepted by revising the file."
Finally, let's note that those who are involved in WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, declared on the CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive escape should be "destroyed".
It came up and Mike Huckabee heard about it in the United States.
World Plan for Renewal of Lighting
The UN proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan for renewal of domestic lighting, trade lighting and industrial spaces in 100 countries to achieve the limitation of greenhouse effects (GES), which corresponds to almost one third of the other restrictions to be aimed at stabilizing the climate of the planet from now to 2020.
This ambitious plan is located in a stadium of major specific projects that the UN wishes to promote in Cancún in order to compensate the absence of difficult commitments to reduce industrially advanced countries.
According to the plan submitted yesterday, if the lighted lights that monopolyze another 50 to 70% of the market are replaced by fluocompact lamps or, even better, lights with electroluminic diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), the essential quantities of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) GES emissions on the planet emerged due to lighting would be discarded.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of world emissions.
It's an equivalent to 70% of the car park emissions all over the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share in emissions such as the United States, China, Europe, and other, including Canada, included in voluntary reduction plans, which should enable the decline of global GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract from this balance 5 Gt to be achieved by 2020 to stabilize climate warming at 2 degrees of Celsia, so it will be possible to exclude it from control.
In the burned lights 95% of energy is dissolved in the form of warmth and the rest, i.e. 5%, is the product of light.
With fluokompact lamps, energy consumption reduces by 75% and with new DL lamps, we reduce this consumption twice more.
Fluocompact lamps will endure between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
New bulbs with DEL, such as those that he put in the production of Philips this week - this company reportedly participated in the UN study - have predicted life of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than the flashlight, which gives us the idea of possible savings with a plan of refund that would apply in 100 countries.
All these new lamps can also work with reostates and light less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts expressed remarks against fluokompact lamps because they contain mercury and are needed to be classified as dangerous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, unless the manufacturers were able to produce collectives.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluokompact lamp, but rather a warm carbon power plant, which releases many mercury needed to produce electricity smashed in the lighted lights.
Only in the United States, these centres put 25,000 tonnes of mercury a year.
The report also detailed the profits of each country from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 heat power plant, whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
The coast of the elephant is eager to expect the results of the electoral results.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, requested an immediate publication of the results of presidential elections in the coast of elephant after the deadlines specified.
"The Secretary-General emphasizes the need for an independent election committee to complete its work and immediately notify the preliminary results, stressed the speaker of the UN President."
"He asks all parties at the coast of the elephant and institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and to keep any initiatives until the notification of the provisional results."
Despite the pressures developed by some foreign governments, the election committee has left the last date - the middle midnight - without publishing the results, three days after the Sunday shortness.
About 40 minutes before the expiry date, the president of the CEI on TV confirmed that the Commission "continues to work" so that it could announce the results.
In the middle of the world , challenges have been reproduced to the CEI finally declare the name of the winner of the second round between the departing Laurent Gbagbo and the opposition member of Alassan Ouattar.
But the Gbagbo camp relies on the cancellation of the Constitutional Council for "laughter" votes in the north, managed by the former rebels of the New Army (FN) since the failure of a state turn in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the Presidential electoral campaign at the Shore of elephants, confirmed that the maneuvers of the intimidation of the voters practiced by the FN (New Army) in the northern country, renounced the President's electoral supporters of the Coast of elephant from going to vote.
The elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council took into account the complaint that Gbagbo filed.
However, the opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the highest court of the country is not neutral because Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who dements any connection with former rebels, condemned the delay in the notification of the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagba to respect them, but did not go so far that it would require victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he suffered loss and that complaint to the Constitutional Council after defending the election committee to dispatch the results would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections, held on Sunday, was considered to be the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two half of the years.
The United Nations warned in the middle of the elephant coast political fraction that it could be responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended in the first round, on October 31, as a winner with 38% of votes, compared to 32% for Alassan Ouattar, who received public support from former President Henry Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France in the sense of the word under the International Labour Authority (BIT) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7%, including foreign areas), as indicated by the commissioning data with the correction of seasonal deviations (CVS), published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed people stopped on 2.631 million in the metropolitan.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the active population in the metropolitan and 9.7% including the foreign areas.
In one year, unemployment rate increases by 0.1 points.
In a broader recording, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in third quarter, but they wish to work, whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, and whether they are looking for work or not.
The situation of current young people on the labour market has yet been made up with a new increase in unemployment rate reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points per year) and 25% including foreign areas.
In the third quarter, 637.000 young people, aged between 15 and 24, were in the meaning of the words of the International Office of Work.
With regard to seniors, they recorded a mild increase in unemployment in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as in a year), 482 000 people from 50 years higher and 6.6%, including foreign areas.
Only a population aged 25-49 has recorded the benefit of unemployment stability at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points per year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee has no longer published the monthly level of unemployment since 2006, after dispute on its method of calculation.
Eurostat, a statistical agency of the European Union, continues to develop monthly statistics and announced on Tuesday 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini is accused and detained
Alexandre Guerini, 53 years old, one of the heads of the waste processing business and the PS brother of the Governing Council of Bouches-du-Rhane, was accused and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of the investigation in public procurement, allegedly received.
Alexandre Guerini was accused of abuse of the property of the company, abuse of public funds and public property, secreting, granting bribes, accepting payments to influence the office and holding guns, he states his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini is a warrior and insists to explain to the judge all the questions that this is going to ask him, and not any insults."
"It is easy to persecute him for many criminal reasons, but another thing is to prove it," his attorney Florence Rault declared to AFP before the interrogation of his client.
Mr. Guerini stated through his lawyers that he sent a brief message before his interrogation to explain everything.
One of his neighbours, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his attorney, Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but ensured the functioning of the stock that he was supposed to manage.
With regard to the allocation of procurement or destination of funds associated with their functioning, he never knew anything like that, said Mr. Simon.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, former Director of Aubagne Aglomeration Services, was accused in the middle of the abuse of public resources and composition, and left on the free, under the prohibition of acquisition, the protagonists of the whole matter.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have been raised to him."
"The judge's investigator takes a look at it and leaves him free," his attorney, Mr. Yann Arnoux, stated.
Another four persons were accused and released on Wednesday night from Tuesday to Wednesday, with judicial surveillance for two of them, stated the State Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, a representative of the Director-General with elegance Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is pursued for the adoption of bribes in order to influence the office and for passive corruption."
Two Aglomeration Officers of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier are accused, one for "recognition and abuse of property of society", the second for "complotation in the abuse of public funds".
Finally, Alexandra Guerini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "closing the abuse of property of society".
Among those confronted with Mr Guerini, the Stéphane Brunengo-Girard is recently accused of a concomitant case of deceptive public procurement in respect of Korsika.
The investigators suspect his company that they were helping to wash money from a large gangstership.
The investigation shall be conducted within a number of open trials against X in April 2009 after the adoption of anonymous letters relating to alleged frauds in the closure of public procurement, in particular in matters of waste.
From the nearby source of investigation, the search focuses particularly on the conditions of allocation and functioning of the stock in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as some cities from the city community of Marseille (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: Elysean Palace overcome Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the Clotilda Reiss, young research worker arrested in Iran for “spionage”, joined the views in France, introduced the diplomacy into combat emergency and emphasized relations between Paris and Teheran.
All of this were carefully monitored by diplomats from the United States.
The American documents received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysean Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, so far that he gave them advice to deal with such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of travelers).
They show how the French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of young French was not compensation for the release of Majid kakand, the Iranian prisoner in France, and the American Justice for the substitute trade in materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they take a sharp light on the way the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian President Bachar al-Assad played a central role in the release of Klotilda Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything for it.
The diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris has the title: "Iran:Francouzian comments to the way to solve in the case of hostages".
Adviser from the Elysian Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by director Quai d'Orsay for North Africa Central East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with the representative of the American diplomacy Allegrone.
They're explaining his French method.
They recommend the Americans to do so much to be transported back to the country by their own nationals by violence detained in Iran.
"Do noise," they say, "continue to say "in the media words "base human rights", "Innocence", "innocence immediately."
It is necessary to bring into a difficult Iranian regime that is sensitive to its image.
"Do it as much as they ask you to stop it."
Because negotiations have been made through discreet channels, "they won't solve anything," the Iranians are "masters of avoiding maneuvers".
Mr. Richier reminds that arresting foreigners is "Iranian family tactics: hostages for "political blackmail".
It announces that the release of Klotilda Reiss (which will occur on 16 August, the day the French embassy will provide her with the shelter) "seeks the payment of the high financial amount to the Iranians" (caution 230 000 euros).
And they announce that the Elysian Palace is anticipating hostage cases, the phenomenon that "will be sharp."
The Iranians could "be arrested in the future for about 1800 French living in Iran," he states.
28 August 2009
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is widespread: Iranian Majid kakand, which the United States declared to be expelled for illegal trade with electronic material sensitive in relation to Iran, is released on freedom in Paris on the basis of the judge's decision.
The American Embassy, as many observers, ask for this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, who pursues illegal Iranian networks to obtain a material designed for the nuclear programme, the dissemination of Majid Khakaanda is a bad news.
France joined the contract?
Liberation of Iranian for the release of young French?
In the next conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4th, François Richier assures that it is not.
The Elysean Palace, he said, was not just "understanded by this decision of the judge," but was looking for an opportunity to stand against it.
"The interviews between the presidential office and the Minister of Justice have been held," Michèle Alliot-Marie, but "the French government cannot change the decision of the court," he notes.
Mr. Richier also wishes to demonstrate that Majid Jakand is under "limited" supervision of the French reporting service.
The Elysian Palace advisor is calling a phone number, hanging the phone listener and then informing the American diplomat that Iran is currently in Paris buildings managed by the Iranian Embassy."
During the time of Clotilda Reiss in Iran, the Elysean Palace of effort is developing, negotiating, through communications and organized "functions" into the media to convince Syrian President Bachar al-Assad plays a "significant" and "influential" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony and find that manipulation brings its fruit, since several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The telegram of 25 August 2009 evolves the medial "blest" of French official factors.
What is the measure of gratitude based on M. Assad, asks the Ambassador in Paris.
"In spite of their statements full of praise, French officials in private recognize that they only have awareness of what the Syrians actually did."
The document is then addressed by the reasons that the Elysean Palace had to pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication "intensively aims to verify President Sarkozy's policy opening with Syria", analyses.
Politics applied in 2008 "has been observed by many critical votes in France and abroad and called pre-time and undeserved".
By "surprising the Syrian role", Paris is trying to "promote Syria, which praise can serve when he plays a constructive role in the area".
The goal is also to sew the grain of dispute between Syria and Iran.
The American embassy knows it from a very good source.
On August 11th, François Richier confessed him: "We certainly don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is."
"But we thanked them."
"That should at least lead to confusion and irregularity between the Iranians."
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy accepts it in the Elysean Palace.
In the communication, he thanks the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the benefit of the liberation of our country".
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Special", which will prohibit adolescents from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, stated the Government's responsible actors.
The proposal of the law will be submitted to Parliament in December to request companies running online games to block access to these games after midnight to persons under 16 years, the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family have stated.
"Mnoge children play these games all night and then they have problems with school learning and are unable to lead normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and their right to sleep," AFP Jo Rin, a leading factor in the Ministry, which has a draft law on charge.
Online games will be newly accessible since 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law.
The government also assumes that it will request companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents are asking for this is supplemented by the responsible employee.
It will also provide people who ask for this, free programs, allowing them to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "infected" countries and the daily press brings regularly different facts related to the intense use of the Internet.
At the same time, the country is a disputeless champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals on World Cyber Games, faced by 58 other nations.
World Championship in 2018-2022: Fifa establishes host countries.
The full disturbance of corruption is established by the Fifa Executive Committee on Thursday of the host country of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, the selection of sovereignly politically motivated, where the struggle for influence and lobbing risks to reach technical criteria.
The thing is sure, the Royal Competition of Fifa will take place in Europe in 2018, the traditional garden of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
In 2022, the Championship will be much more exotic, and the International Federation hopes that it will be able to gain a new territory (Qatar, Australia) after the premiere in the African continent in 2010, or continue to enter the United States or to the Remote East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that will be attended within the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Kataro, Heads of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the opportunity to create an idea of economic and political bets throughout the world.
The negotiations in the behind the scene face the risk that they will last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy according to candidates.
According to Fifa's assessment report, English documentation, Spanish and Portuguese (2012) and American (2022) contain the best arguments as well as their competitors' documentation.
But these reasons will not have too much weight for 22 members of the executive committee in an hour for voting.
Sunday Times at the beginning of the discovery leading to suspending two members of the CE/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temaria et Amos Adam) may have destroyed the chances of his country, the colleagues that have hosted the world championship only once in the year.
The BBC put the crown on Monday when she sent a document that "whispered on the spin" three influenced members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fif unsatisfactory and bring an english leader with David Cameron first.
The President of the Government hopes that he will be able to repeat the move that his precedents in the function of Tony Blair, who was able to gain for London's Olympic Games in 2012.
Is this intense activity enough to add a new brightness to its name in the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the Spanish-Portuguese couple is not missing the triumph of already prepared stadiums, its well-being (the World Championship in Spain in 1982, the Olympic Games 1992 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the sick economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Caseful legal measures against the English and the doubts of the payment eligibility of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was outsider even through spaces in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But the President of the Government, Vladimir Poutin, decided that the championship will not be moved to Curich and publicly declared "some competition in the preparation of vote", in the words only scarcely prosecuted against the members of the CE (European Commission).
"We'll throw the mud after them, we'll try to compromise them," said Mr. Poutin.
For 2022 it seems to be a logical favorite of the United States with its significant experience of 1994.
The world's highest performance of the economy, the seat of the chief sponsors of Fifa, seems to have a great prospect in front of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have prepared a beautiful project.
But these candidatures seem to be too early for both countries who together did "test" in 2002.
Further threat: the grant of world championship 2026 China, which is hot to Fifa, made the Asian chances for 2022 unfounded.
With Katar, who pulled a large eso from the glove in the form of futurist stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand into new lands, but these two countries represent more risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could be arguing for TV fees (for time movement) paid by European countries, creating a motion force for Fifa.
Second mandate: apparentness (sigurity)
De Gaulle was really hesitating.
Mitterrand woke up his appearance that he's hesitating.
Valerie Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate at least.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than them.
The mandate of the Elysian Palace calls someone else.
The current head of the State will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the apparentness is not in good conformity with the share of the secrets associated with the Chairman's function.
It should therefore be done as if doubts continued to persevere.
In one and in the other way.
In 2006, without being believed, Jacques Chirac's friends made their privileges for the third mandate not to be excluded.
On November 15th, with a serious expression Nicolas Sarkozy assured that "he will decide at the autumn of 2011."
As it reminds the members of the UMP Parliament on Wednesday night in the Elysean Palace, the perspective of "two mandates" has sewed a little hot status.
Was that an official notice of his candidacy?
It wasn't far from that.
The President only recalled that the amendment of the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year functioning periods to two.
It was of his part just a constatation, not a notice.
It's not the first time he reminds at such a humorous tone of presidential election.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you have another seven and a half years with me," he passed in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about another stage."
His previous statements will not make him a candidate more than the previous day; it does not make him a candidate or less.
If they're calling comments, it's because of the double truth.
Acceleration of the path to the PS candidate, on page one.
But it's not the entrance to the Segolèna Royala club that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to confess.
It is, on the contrary, because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want to arrange the fighting systems rather early than intended.
Bad survey on the other side.
First, the right voters would prefer Frances Phillone's candidature before Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have candidates and we don't discuss this thing with UMP," people from the nearest neighborhood of the government reacted immediately and carefully.
"If he believes the possible defeat, he will not be running," Jean-Pierre Raffarin informs.
"He will still believe that he can win," repairs Alain Juppe, balanced with apparently.
Euro: The Central European Bank is forced to continue its shopping of state titles.
The latest meeting of the Governing Council of the Central Council in the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for withdrawal from the crisis or at least notifying a large number of unusual monetary policy operations to be terminated by the end of this year.
The crisis of the supreme European claims is obliged, the Institute for Securities Publishment will certainly not be able to afford such a category under the threat of the deterioration of the situation today so tense on European markets with valuable papers.
The political price would be higher in that case.
On the occasion of the press conference, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde gave up an active role played by the Central European Bank in the favour of the crisis of the claims of European States.
She didn't want to say if she thought that the bank could do more, for example, by enhancing their program of purchase of supervised bonds.
"I'm threatening my consideration for my European partners..."
On the evening before, in Brussels, the Commission for Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, President of the Central European Bank Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show himself more specific about his intentions and satisfied that he stated that the Shopping Programme on the secondary market is "continuing" and "We will see how we decide" during the Thursday meeting.
The only guarantee is: the Central European Bank will be watching its basic interest rate at 1%, its historical lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, shopping bonds from the treasure made by the Central European Bank have doubled up to almost 1.35 billion euros in the last week.
And thanks to the insensitiveness of the market agreements, she made a new purchase of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
The total Eurosystem central banks have purchased 67 billion euros since May 2010.
There are no doubts between the market anticipation agreements on the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Even the economists do not expect any significant change in course.
If the loans operations have already disappeared from the Central European Bank's arsenal for more than three months, the latest appointed bank shall access the unlimited provision of liquid funds under generous conditions and the duration of one week to three months.
The economies today expect this mechanism to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine she would change her program in a significant way."
"If not, this would mean a risk of a short-term new tension," said Michael Schubert, a Commerzbank Economy.
"Progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," says Norbert Bräms, an econome at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In order to plan its interventions on the public debt market, "the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of buying its bonds to restore the faint market," Norbert Bräms added.
In view of the exposure of European banks on the markets with supervised debt in the euro area, there is no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It needs to replace the lack of investors on the market at any price and act in such a way as to prevent the inflammation of payable performance of the states belonging to the most fragile," the important bond manager confirmed yesterday.
Because if interest rates start up, the States will be more troubled to reduce their debts rather than to stabilize it.
It's a saving of euro for this price.
In Italy, the Government of Berlusconico back
After the start of the week for Italy, anxious situation has a little reliefed, with a back-to-day bond rate for 10 years.
Return to temporary peace.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economy of the Regions, the presidents said they heard Giulia Tremonti qualifying the situation as "unresolved" and expecting "unforeseen" weekends, which he then demented.
In any case, in Tuesday, the derogation from the long German interests reached the record of 210 basic points and the price of contracts to cover against the bankruptcy risk (CDS) arrived to 263 points, which caused a certain disturbance in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the derogation with German interests was higher than 400 basic points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, declared himself "too busy" by "burning market development" and possible infection from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third eurozone economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an econome at the Hudson Institute.
Right and unencrypted, her problem is the absence of growth and inexplicit fiscal inputs, which goes in hand and exposes a state of risk that it will not be able to cover its funding needs.
The last forecasts of Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is expected from now on to 1,1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public financial deficit will represent another 4.3% of the gross domestic product in the next year (at 3.9% as expected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
The reputation of a new sum of supplements to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after holidays, amounted to 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new strict measures will have to be taken," the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn, evaluates.
For this moment, Italy accepts the support of international institutions.
"The basic stones of its economy are fine and its calculations are correct, we repeat it for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian member of the International Monetary Fund, under the pressure of Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, neither short-term or long-term, because, through its significant debt (119.2% of the gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR), the efforts to stabilize demanded in Italy are less than the efforts required from other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, the main OCDE economy.
The issue of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face the proposal for the non-confidence of the House of Ambassadors and then the elections that are counted at the end of March will be organized.
This would be the beginning of a period not suitable for a decision in the case of a serious crisis.
The Europeans are considering strengthening anti-criss mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde again emphasized it yesterday as part of the press conference in Paris: "I think the Europeans have demonstrated it throughout Sunday and night, apparently very solidly determined, engaged in defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded expansion relating to the interests on European state bonds, it brought water to the governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
The Standard & Poor's Notation Authority announced that it could degrade Portugal’s debt record, the goals to which the various speculations are most focused.
"Because in May there is a real insufficient and obvious policy, based in particular on banking systems," says Exane BNP Paribas.
More about that "political time runs slower than market time."
In the knowledge of this discontinued connection and the dangers that hide, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing crisis mechanisms.
The informal consultation between finance ministers, most affected the problem, and, in a broader manner, with their G20 restraints, is very well developed.
In view of the meetings of the Eurogroup (Eurogroup) and the Ecofin group from the beginning of the next week.
The meeting of the Central European Bank is being held today.
The programme is fate of non-convention measures to support the eurozone countries focusing on markets (see above).
As regards the European Finance Fund (FESF), its Executive Director Klaus Regling, incorporated a road to Asia on Tuesday in Singapore in order to inform investors from the Remote East on the development of the crisis in Europe.
If this path is not intended to increase the funds, it is preparing for sure the ground to achieve this goal.
The first emissions of FSF securities shall be assumed for the next month.
Yesterday, the US official informed the agency Reuters that the United States would support the possible increase in mobilized funds by additional direct involvement in the FMI.
The countries in the first row, Portugal and Spain, are preparing for the adoption of structural reforms, in particular as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms which are attached to strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid have taken a different way than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid asking for international assistance at any rate before they apply their own budgetary adjustments and decide on structural reforms necessary to regain their lasting trust.
Capital participants in European funds finally talk about options available to accelerate the market normalisation process with supervised bonds.
On his journey to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came to the idea of whether 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund would not hesitate to reach the supply of valuable papers again.
Economies from Barclays Capital, an actor of the entire first trading plan with European supreme claims, believes that an additive of approximately 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "will be preferred" as a form of direct financial liquidity.
The average is: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, which is funded for this day by 60 billion euros.
The Council that has all the chances to be tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions were worsened.
Snow and land: 24 districts have orange emergency.
Snow allocations cause more difficulties in transport, especially on the roads of other classes in Bretani, and there is a risk of disrupting some economic activities.
Twenty-four districts have an orange emergency from now on because of the risk of snow and snow.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, forest Deux-Severs and la Vienne, joined 20 districts that have already announced orange emergency, 18 since midday afternoon and two, La Dordogne and La Gironde, later at night.
According to Metheo France, significant snow attractions cause problems in the northern la Gironde and forest Charentes and weak snow on Ile-de-France.
The snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the regions concerned and a cover from 1 to 3 cm, places to 5 in the Paris region.
Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and regions of Basse-Normandia, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snow induces are large enough to cause transport problems and disturb some economic activities, prophesied by Metheo France.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some districts have prohibited a heavy car transport - more than 7,5 tonnes with Guingamp-Lannion route and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The road traffic on the roads of other classes in Bretani is very difficult, and the police recommends to ride with their vehicle only when it is really necessary and some trucks have been cancelled for this day.
In Picardia, school compounds were banned on Thursday.
Wednesday night no special measures are predicted to limit cargo transport.
The district office "invites all drivers of cars to as much caution on roads and to adapt the nature of the vehicle".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel 25% of their flights on the Roissy Paris airport on Thursday and 10% on the Eagle because of the expected snowflows.
DGAC recommends that travellers use air transport services connect to their company.
In Britain, closed Gatwick airport in southern London and Edinburgh airport in Scotland are closed until the quarter morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate on modernisation of transport to Ile-de-France is full of stream, there are billions raining.
At least during the debate.
Especially, we remind 23 billion on the Grand Paris subway, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to be launched, the State of granting 4 billion euros announced that this building could be launched.
It is theoretically the amount that will then enable SGP to use part of its double source for contracts.
Today we finally get to the first supplements.
The 2010 Rectivation Act, which is examined by the Financial Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains mechanisms set out to ensure these funds.
There are two: the creation of special taxes from equipment and increased tax from offices on Ile-de-France.
First, we read in the text of the draft law, article 15, "for the benefit of the public institution, Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated: "The interest rate is 117 million euros per year."
The second is the restructuring of the office, which already exists, "to be modernized to increase the profit from it and to affect Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it take?
Translucency.
This is not numbered in the text.
We're far from four billion.
"It is affirmed that these fiscal resources are attached to 4 billion euros from capital grants that will be mobilized by the state and put in the Société du Grand Paris company according to the project," we can read in explanation of the reasons.
This system does not seem shocking to us in SGP.
"From the moment we created revenues (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then grab up to 4 billion, explains here."
"It will be included in the budget and used as necessary."
The SGP considers that 4 billion will be allocated until 2013 for the budget for 2014.
This mechanism, in which four promised billions belong to still absent advocates, risks to cause a somewhat disturbing parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting will be December 7th.
Revenge hackers and reasonable investigators
The WikiLeaks case is a double significance.
On the one hand, there is an obvious scandal, a scandal that appears to be just a scandal faced to hypocrisy, which governs relations between States, citizens and press.
On the other hand, it speaks about deep changes at international level and prevails the future with a controlled regression.
But let's keep going.
First aspect of WikiLeaks, this is a confirmation of the fact that every document prepared by a secret service (whichever nation) consists exclusively of press cuts.
"Insequent discovery" of the Americans on the way of sexual life, Berlusconii announced what they could have read in any newspapers (all other than these two Berlusconi own), and the cadafi's caricature profile has been for the cabaret artist theme for sketches for a long time.
The rule, according to which secret documents may only be collected from the reports already known, is essential in the dynamic of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to the bookstore which is dedicated to esoterical literature, you will see that each work repeats (o Graal, mystery of Rennes-le-Château, Templars or Zeds) exactly what has already been written in previous articles.
And not only because the author of the occult texts does not like to look for new information (or doesn't know where to look for reports about the missing), but because those who devote to occultism believe only what they know and confirm what they have learned before.
That's the mechanism of Dana Brown's success.
The same applies to secret documents.
The informant is lazy and lazy (or limited spirit) chief of secret services (and if he is not, he may, as I know, be a editor in the Liberation newspaper), who considers true only what he admits himself.
The information with a high secret about Berluscon, which the US Embassy sent to the state resort, was the same that Newsweek published a week ago.
Why, then, did the discovery of these documents make so much benefit?
On the one hand, they say what each cultivated person already knows, even though the embassy, at least since the end of the second world war and since the heads of the state can call or fly to a joint dinner, lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of several small exercises in the representatives, transformed into a spy centre.
Any watcher watching research movies knows very well that only from hypocrisy it seems to be ignored.
However, the fact that it is repeated publicly, is a disgrace to hypocrisy and it puts bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can get the most strictly secret information of the most powerful country of the world represents a hard blow, not negligible, for the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both the victims and his "personal."
But let's go from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once, in Orwell's times, it was possible to understand all the powers, like some Big Brother who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvel's prophecy has been proven since the possibility to control every movement through the phone, every transaction, every visited hotel, used by the road and so on, has become a total victim of the power vein.
But when we show how it goes now that even the "graves" with the most secret information of the mighty can't resist the intrusion of a hacker, it stops to be a control report unidirect and becomes an orbital.
Power controls every citizen, but any citizen, or at least hacker - chosen as a vindicator of the citizens - can know all secrets of power.
How can the power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets ?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the true secret is an inexplicit secret (and the absence of secrets will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the nature of Berlusconigo or Merkel is a truly mysterious secret, because it is extracted from public life; but to reveal, just as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were inexplicit secrets, means to take away all the power from him.
WikiLeaks didn't make any mistake with Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this wound be so important?
It is obvious that in the future, the States will not be able to send online sensitive information - that would be equal to its publication on the poster on the corner of the street.
But it is also completely obvious that current technologies are unnecessary to hope that you can keep the message secreted by the phone.
There's nothing easier than finding out whether and when the head of the state traveled by a plane and connected to one of its colleagues.
How will they be able to keep private and sensitive news in the future ?
I know that for this moment my prognosis belongs to science-fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government factors that are transporting discreetly the formalities after uncontrollable routes and carrying only those messages that know memory or rather hiding rare information in the shoe patch.
The information will be stored in unique copies in key-copies closed: totally, the attempt to spy in Watergate's affair has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology now moves side forward, which means back.
A century later, when a wireless telegraph meant a revolution in communication, the Internet rehabilitated a telegraph based on wire (telephones).
Video tapes (analogs) allowed lovers of the movie to take the film step by step, move it forward and back and reveal all secrets of the mounting, while now CD (digits) allows only to jump on chapters, which means the macroports.
By means of rapid trains, we will arrive from Rome to Milan in three hours, while we need three and a half hours to travel by aircraft and transport.
It is therefore unusual that politics and communication techniques will return to the cars dragged by horses.
Last note.
In another time, the press tried to understand what was founded in the secret of the Embassy.
Now these are the embassy that ask for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France hacked its promises of funding
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to test the fulfilment of the promises for fast unlocked funding (specific funding with rapid start) or early), implemented by developed countries.
And the big French hacks were discovered.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, the growing countries committed to provide $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has promised 7.2 billion euros for three years and France 1.26 billion euros (this is 420 million a year).
At the beginning of the COP16, the EU has drawn a large eso to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to finance a fast start: a report on the action of its Member States, the press conference, the grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
Transparency operations are invaluable and evaluated at their real value: advanced countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do them the same and with the same precision.
The EU announces that it released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, which brings her to the right path to fulfil its promise of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on the details, we find things much more complicated.
These funds are "new and additional" under the Copenhagen Agreement to ensure that increased burden has been implemented without prejudice to the Public Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no coincidence in what means "new and extra".
While the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the process.
Everyone today chooses the reference that fits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered the 2009 reference: international finance remained and it adds 150 million to it for three years of funding for a quick start.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment terms or terms at the level of public aid for development.
On the contrary, France believes that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and extra".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of the previous periods or to the global level of Public aid for the development of d'Aide publicque au déveveloppement.
In particular, the total amount of France's assistance to developing countries can remain unchanged (or even reduced) should fulfil its commitment to finance "new and additional "...
Another crucial element is the division of gifts and loans.
There's still no rule there, and everyone chooses their own way of calculating.
Some, such as France, consider that 1€ is equal to 1€ given.
Apparently, it is difficult to prove: efforts are not comparable.
If the use of loans can be demonstrated for certain investments that are rental (the projects associated with the reduction of emissions combined with more efficient technologies) is a blast to present one euro that we receive, as an equivalent to one euro that we give... , we should not understand it from the title of our commitments, but as a loan price for the crediting country (i.e. an equal interest rate).
But France can only provide the following recitals: "Solid" its commitment of 420 million euros, which makes 91.5% of the loan (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% of the gifts (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document so that you can verify it yourself.
It is the only Union country that uses the loan in such a measure.
Germany demanded 46% from here, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (mean others) respect their commitments with 100% of gifts.
In other words, if the full majority of the European Union gives 1€ to its promise, it will only give France 10 cents and consider this effort comparable.
Beautiful cucumber piece!
For summary, in its financing "fast start" France operates with a two-handed deployment: on the one hand with the development of shares in time and on the other hand with real financial burden.
Although he only issues 36.1 million euros, he can convince that he is expensing 420 million euros "new and additional" in connection with his promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that although it is Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact within the EU at the same time (why would Member States continue to donate, if only borrowing?) and negotiating, because the developing countries are not completely naive...
The chapter of early funding is only a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to the series of climate discussions.
But it could be an extra sand grain in a huge machine like UNFCCC.
Let's hope this isn't our case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to draw knowledge from this first year of early funding.
First, France should notify the change in its way of conducting accounting evidence for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of compliance with its obligations and respect and justice to other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should prevent debate on contributions to long-term finance (other substantive chapter currently discussed): we will not avoid the question of "supplementarity" or the way of receiving loans.
France should change its attitude so that it becomes as progressive in these contributions as it is in others.
The hope is therefore given to the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs. Kosciusko-Morizet, who is coming to Cancun next week.
A surprising notification of France's fast start and its vision of "supplementarity" and the use of loans could result in an increase in international confidence level necessary to continue in the discussions.
Alarms on pesticides that children eat.
A ten-year-old child dies one day 81 different chemicals, according to one study published by this center, from the Association of future generations (ex-Growing for Rights and Conservation of future generations).
The association notes that its results "no significant statistical value in view of a low number of analysed samples, but are characteristic of the processed problem," bought between July and September foods normally consumed in four foods and one light food as a light meal for one child for about a decade in supermarkets in L'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1,5 litres of water daily - as well as diabetes, were analysed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutant factors.
The balance of the plate is crushing: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are broken between carcinogenic substances, possibly or likely, and five substances belong to clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that may affect as disturbing for irons with internal mixing (PE), according to studies of several institutions such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, in our research we well see that the reality in the exposure of consumers to contaminating substances, perhaps carcinogenic, and/or PE is infective," the association states.
For breakfast butter and milk tea contain about ten résidues with possible cancer effects and three proven as certain carcinogenes, as it is in about 20 remains that could disturb the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, introduced by study as a small meal, contains traces of six chemical substances, including the forbidden fungicide in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, in which studies revealed signs of strong insecticides prohibited in the EU.
Furthermore, the milk meat steak, tuna in the beans, and even gum and gums were spiked pesticides and other chemicals.
The presence of nitrogens and chloroforms revealed in the water from the corner of the analysis.
The steak from salmon to dinner was "the richest" with 34 chemical residues discovered and even analyses of plastic plate used to warm food in a microwave pipe did not avoid the analysis.
The final risk for consumers of this "contaminating substance cocktail" is probably underestimated," according to the study.
The Environmental Europe-Green (EE-LV) communities suggested that the moratorium for the use of pesticides should be designed to stop "the growth of civilization diseases".
In July, the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) studied the status of the residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
