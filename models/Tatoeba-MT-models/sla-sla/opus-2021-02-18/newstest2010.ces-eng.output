Barack Obama will receive the Nobel Prize of Peace as the Fourth President of America
The American President Barack Obama will arrive to Norwegian Oslo for 26 hours to take the Nobel Prize of Peace here as the fourth American President in history.
Diploma, medals and checks on $1.4 million, inter alia, will be given special efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The Chief of the White House will fly to the Norwegian metropole in the morning and with Michelle's wife, and she'll be busy.
First he visits the Nobel Institute, where he first met with five members of the committee, chosen from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The president's couple then has a scheduled meeting with Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
After afternoon, the visit will be the top of the ceremonial ceremony to which Obama will take prestigious appreciation.
He'll get him as the fourth president of America, but only a third who gets the price directly in the office.
The White House has already reviewed that Obama will speak about Afghan war when he conqueres appreciation.
The president does not want to avoid this subject because he realizes that he takes the price as a president, who is currently warring in two countries.
A few days ago, war effort has increased by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which will not forget to emphasize none of his critics.
At the Obama ceremony, he will also receive gold medals, diplomas and checks for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
She's going to put them on charity purposes, but he hasn't yet decided on a specific charity.
The charged programme will then lead the president with a wish to a banket, where other than the Norwegian king and queen will also be the ministerial President and 250 other invited guests.
Obama was more delayed from the beginning to the price.
He said, for example, that he felt that he did not deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that it was not only for him, but for all who seek the same values as he.
Right after the notice, he said he was "the invitation to action".
Nature protector accused of blackmail
The Lithuanian police accused the President of the Civil Association of Nature Protectors of Lithuania of blackmail.
In several cases in the past year he appealed to some construction proceedings, he demanded money from investors for his benefit, said Lithuanian police speaker Alena Romová.
The chairman of the Lithuanian Nature Protector Society is Lubomir Studnička.
He's in custody now, and he's threatened to be in prison for up to three years.
Brnu's trashing containers don't smell much
In Prague, ordinary people can classify packagings from drinks, and in the south-eastern villages you will again meet classing containers on every step.
And in Brna?
That's where you can make a few minutes before you find the proper garbage.
I don't want to say that in Brno waste isn't going to work at all.
But it seems to me that we are the second largest city in the Republic, they are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the forest line of waste classification, not only by being citizens, we can still throw paper, glass and plastic, but in particular by the number of waste wastes to such a waste.
Have you ever tried to throw the PET bottle into the collection basket?
It's a finished mumshot, mostly it wants time and hard nerves.
The only place I've ever met is on the Moravian Square across the Hoose.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but I don't think it's a hell of a bit.
Not to mention that in other parts, there is no honey classification.
A lot of my friends don't like waste.
From lazyness.
Because they have it far from the garbage.
I don't wonder them.
After the party, I offered myself to throw a few glass and plastic bottles out.
But I didn't see any colouring trash on the Counic Street in the visual.
Fortunately, I ran into the right place.
However, the waste flowed out of it.
It's still the center of Brna, which the city represents most, isn't it?
But the ecology and some aesthetics probably don't care much about the brown socialists.
The city would rather buy a hockey extrallage that would shame us all over the Republic than buy a few extra containers and offer the sorting of other raw materials for the cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I could have confirmed my opinion after a moment of browsing on the Internet with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Sealand.
Paruubkov's budget took retirement money and sickness.
In spite of the opinion of the Government of farmers or officials, there must be no retirement, sickness or construction money in the budget.
But also interests from state debt or international judicial disputes.
This brings problems to those who will rule in the second half of the next year, says Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and Communists had promoted a promotion to certain groups, they relied on sensitive expenditure, pensions, or hospital governments to borrow additionally. "It is just a disposition of problems to the future, mines putting," Janota says.
Because the loan money is increasingly paying interests, and sometimes it has to return.
Too much to choose where to take it, there's no state.
If it does not reduce the social doses or costs of the state’s movement, it must raise taxes.
Everyone who's left now added to: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later their children.
The pensions or the hospital, whose account disappeared 1,8 billion, people don't have to worry, they get them.
However, at the price of being more debted – the next year will not be missing only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow more quickly and with him and the interest costs.
The State will need money for its remuneration and it will no longer be sufficient to increase the VAT or to reduce maternity, as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
A number of voters will also be missing five billion for roads and railways for the next year.
It is mainly of the already rigged and set parts that are not able to be re-designed and, if possible, unleashed.
The highest reservation, which is not for free, too.
This means the delay or stopping of thirty large buildings, also the risk of drawing European money, warns the speaker of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CHSSD suggested that the loss of money will solve the Shalamounsky – to touch the dividends of CEZ, which is mostly owned, and that it will add to the transport fund.
The problem is, the above dividenda is never sure, and it's not a single source anymore.
Last year, the CEZ came to the budget of 18 billion.
Each year, the dividends are subject to the elimination of environmental damages, the pension account is supplemented or served as a reserve for a preparatory retirement reform.
Furthermore, this trick, under EU rules, increases the actual deficit of the budget to the level of 5.7 per cent of GDP.
However, this does not end the carnival of movements.
Almost three billion have lost the budget for a variety of communism and criminal offences or expenditure on judicial disputes, even for construction.
If it takes care of it without this money, it's not sure.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international dispute, we'll have to pay it anyway, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save money within the resort or, in the worst case, to touch the government's budgetary reserve.
There is also a hundred million missing for a two-billion national treasure project that will allow the online to monitor what individual authorities spend.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, the sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems.
The Americans count to the future with a cell phone on which the user will switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
Exposed plans sound promising.
Just press one key and you will be transferred from Windows Mobile within a few seconds to Android.
This is exactly what it puts on the aim of the U.S. VMware company, which focuses mainly on the development of a virtualisation software for computers.
We'll allow you to run two user profiles at once.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will work at the same time, named Srivas Krishnamurti from VMware in the interview for Computerworld.
He was presented in November last year, and a few days ago he was first presented.
It will be marketed in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully conducted a smartphone test sample with two operating systems.
It was adjusted to Nokia N800 with the RAM size of 128 MB, on which the Windows Mobile and Android systems were also running.
The development of a new technology for mobile phones is in full stream.
Now VMware is cooperating with European and American operators to test smartphone virtualisation and to customers should be reached during 2012.
The lack of snow on the mountains suffers from hotels
The naked conventions don't only concern the croconic wanderers.
The missing snow also distracts people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoshi still can gather free rooms for all winter terms, including Christmas and Silvestra.
We have a big visit on our sites.
People are going through offers, finding prices, but yet they are afraid to order.
And if they are calling us, they will immediately ask if this year's Christmas will be on snow or mud," said the operator of the Spindl Information Portal.Info Martin Jandura.
Whoever wants a Silvestrov stay in Spindler's Milk exactly according to his imaginations, he said he should not hesitate with the order.
Who prefers savings of money and the quality of accommodation is in his second place, he can still try to wait a few days.
Spindler hotelers offer Silvestra mostly only weekly.
I think they're going to try to give them up for a while, but then they're going to let them go for a shorter time.
And then the free rooms will live quickly," estimated Jandura.
A free bed in all winter terms still offers the top-class travel office of Ingtours.
Now we're most interested in Christmas week that hasn't been sold yet.
Even so, half of the places in our offer remain free.
That's why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stay for the last minute," said Director Ingtours Peter Schiefert.
Silvestra in Krkonoshi can still offer a high-class travel office, but the free places are less.
The first 14 days in February, the remaining winter terms are sold average.
This year, interest in winter stays negatively affects the fact that there is still no snow in the Krkonoshes.
People are waiting for him to attack.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year on the mountains without snow.
If they are snowed during the week, Christmas will also be produced," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, something better than the last year can be held in the hotel Horizont in Pec under Snow.
We're about five percent better at that.
We have the last few places for Silvestro and Christmas.
The great interest is in the Polish holidays in January and is well sold in February," informed the director of the best peck hotel, Karel Council.
Of 80 percent, the hotel Omnia is also located at the central parking lot in Janski Lázni.
On the contrary, Christmas remains in the latest Yancolasian hotel for half of the beds free.
This year, we were surprised by the January that we already have approximately sixty percent.
It's a little weaker for February, but once the snow attacks, the interest in staying in Krkonoshes will definitely rise, the director of the Omnia Eric Sporysch said.
However, on the larger part of the snow, the croconic hotelers must still have the taste.
On Thursday, it's cool, if there's some collapse, there should be snow in the mountains.
But then again heat, he informed Jiri Jakubski from the castle office of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
U.S.: Repeat is the mother of wisdom
It's just as comic, with what school skills Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest, repeats in the Afghan question of the strategy of his precedent, who he himself thought was the dumbest.
When he finally sweated his desired Afghan doctrine, it turns out he described it through a copy from Bush's Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not only in the text itself, he uses the word "as in Iraq", but did not hesitate even to use the name Bush's statement in January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Way to Go forward".
He criticised Bush's idea to send fresh military forces to Iraq as "independent and in his consequences of a disaster decision".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy based on the recommendations of the field commanders was the only possible and highly successful enough that today, in the reporting reports about Iraq, it was not at all spoken.
This did not improve the reputation of Bush, but he objectively left his successor a much more grateful standard situation than it could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
He was asked to increase the military contingent again, especially the top commander of the Afghan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who even criticized the heightened shooters in the White House, even despite the underlying habit.
He asked for 40,000 men to break the situation to better.
The president was hesitating for three months, but he didn't look like anything better, so at least he screwed the General for 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he was able to wave another 5000 promises, even though he originally counted at least at 10.
The most difficult thing in the whole Obama Strategy seems to be his intention to start downloading armies from Afghanistan in 18 months and end this process in three years. The whole Obama doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that half an increase will give the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the last year's hostile war, Iraqi society is relatively well arranged, its leaders honor the agreement.
The Afghan situation is indicated by the opposite symptom - no one can be relyed on and no agreements are being followed.
Under these conditions, the Afghan security forces are incorrectly prepared every day to change the gentleman according to their suitability.
Political institutions, even if they are formally established, will remain only a rumor village for which the patriarchal tribal relations will continue.
The balance of the interests of various ethnic groups is extremely complicated with regard to the inadequateness of relations that even more complicate the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even building "Accessibility State", which is a minimum target of the whole operation, doesn't seem too real.
The time horizont of Obama's strategy infects its voluntaryism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only been worsening and is now on the edge of the explosion.
To believe that the soldiers sending to the war wave in order to "fast return home" will cause a miracle here, only the souls really romantic, in fact not touched.
From political perspective, the determination of the date of the withdrawal of the armies is inadequate, as Taliban will see it as an indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in fighting operations in Afghanistan is a minus.
European politicians do not know and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy relates to the war in the underground of Hindukus.
Another factor that is capable of radically affecting the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to be worsened and the increased sanctions on Iran will not be affected, it will be difficult to ask the United States whether to try to solve the problem with the military force.
It will be necessary to answer it just at the time, according to Obama, America will move to a victory download from Afghanistan.
Each such solution will also mean a dramatic turning in the Afghan situation.
The only flash for Barack Obama is the fact that the presidential elections remain for three years, and so there is still enough time to come with another strategy if it turns out to be a total ruin.
Goldman Sachs bank managers will no longer receive rewards in cash
The high leaders of the U.S. Bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash rewards this year.
It was announced by a company that responded to the sharp criticism of its remuneration practices.
The group of 30 front managers will receive instead of the money of the stock that will be sold first in five years.
Furthermore, the actions may be taken to managers if they are excessively risked.
According to the Reuters agency, Goldman Sachs is in the head of the attempt to bond awards on Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction to be issued, the former investment banker of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott stated.
The problem is in detail, he added.
The Goldman Sachs Bank became a target of criticism after the first three quarters of the year, she made a party nearly $17 billion (almost 300 billion Kč) for rewards.
The total remuneration in the company this year according to the Reuters Agency will apparently exceed $20 billion, despite today's announced measure.
The high prizes in the banking sector have become a hot political theme in a number of countries with the coming of the financial crisis.
In the Wednesday, Britain announced that it would intend to bonuses of bankers exceeding 25,000 pounds (approximately 712.000 CZK) to unanimously charge 50 per cent of taxes.
France is preparing similar steps.
This year, women received the Nobel Price in all fields other than physics
The recorded five women today in Stockholm took over from the hands of Swedish King Carla XVI. Gustaf's yearly Nobel prices in professional categories and literature.
In addition to four scientists, there was also a German writer of Romania Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine received two American biologs Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider along with their countryman Jack Sistok for chromosom research.
The price for chemistry was given by Israel Ada Jonathan along with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for the explanation of the structure and function of the fishosoms.
The latest laureate had the Nobel price for the economy that American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson received for economic management analysis.
The only professional categories that took place without a holder this year was physics.
This price was taken today by scientists Charles As for research in the area of optical fibres and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical videos.
Each appreciated took over the diploma, the Nobel Medal and the financial reward certificate.
It reaches ten million Swedish crowns in each category (approximately 25 million Kč).
If they are more marked in each of them, they share the reward.
Traditionally the most eager Nobel prize for peace received this afternoon in Norwegian Oslo, US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he recognized the controversiality of his appreciation, because he is only at the beginning of his track and also stands in the head of the country leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But in defence of his policy, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary to combat peace, even though the price is high.
Minister Janota considers demision.
The President Václav Klaus will accept on Friday morning the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janot, who considers the government's responsibilities because he disagrees with the form of the state budget for the next year as the Ambassador approved on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps Janot's staying in the office will be themes of their Friday meeting.
The startup is criticizing Klaus too.
He believes he has too high deficit, which further enhancing the crisis of public finances.
The president's speaker Radim Ochvat informed the meeting.
He wants to deal with Prime Minister Jane Fischer on Monday on his next responsibilities.
According to the Budget Act, which now receives Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should handle the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The House, however, agreed in the middle on the proposals of the left to move money and increased the money to pay public employees, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government highlighted the proposals for social democracy that hidingly raised the deficit of the budget.
Among the left on one and the government, Klaus and the right side of the other caused a sharp internal-policy dispute, which causes the questionnaire to be raised over the further effect of the Fischer's office, for which the formation of the spring was agreed by the ODS, the CSD and the Green Party.
The criticians argue that the budget, as the House adopted, is essentially eliminated by a package of savings measures that the Fischer's government has earned on the autumn and which is to stop the debt of the State.
Klaus, which State budget law, but also does not have to sign, said to the businessman on today's breakfast that politicians for a long time had been ignoring the "value problem", which is "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
He doesn't think he's got a good solution today.
The improvement could only be brought by a strong government, which could further support the broader consensus of political parties, the president believes.
The President of ODS Mirek Topolanec stated that the budget is frightening and the government should consider further existence.
Vice-President Peter Netime said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and green is obviously no longer working.
Prime Minister Fischer in response referred to similar words as "powerful words".
Chief of Chief Jiří Paroubek responded to Topolanka by saying that the scary is the deficit of the budget, which the former Topolank government prepared for this year and which exceeds 200 billion crowns.
She has already marked the State budget's approval on Wednesday for success for the next year.
The humans were also satisfied.
Mandelu played Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's news.
South Africa claims that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The unpossessed will tell the world a lot about the country, its fight and victories despite some criticism that the main roles of American actors are.
The story tells us about sports, racial conditions and Nelson Mandel.
An intimidated warrior against the racist regime of apartheid in the South African Republic and her first black president Nelson Mandelu in his life story represents the Oscar American acter Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that the age of 19, Mandela, asked him if he could be created in Eastwood's movie.
Another important role in it is Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I play you, I'll have access to you.
Twenty-seven-year-old actor who won a price for the role of Eastwood's drama from the box Million Dollar Baby, has already created, for example, the leader of the movement for abolishing slavery, which eventually became a slave, a fictile President of the United States, and even a god in God's Evan, but only rarely someone who is still alive and is so important for many people like Mandela.
For 27 years, the former South African State was in prison for his active work for the end of the apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and then became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded by the Nobel Price for Peace.
Invictus is a Latin word for unbeaten and is the name of the poem of the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The picture is a true story of how Nelson Mandela connected powers with the captain of the South African football team, Francoise Pienaar, to help unify the country. The new elected President Mandela knows that his people remain after apartheid still racially and economically divided.
They believe that their people can connect through sports, so they decide to unify the football players who belong to the world's level between outsiders.
The South African team will eventually enter the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman's been working on Mandel's story on the sheet for several years.
I had no other goal than to play this role so that I could get closer to it as real as possible, said Freeman.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to speak like him.
The actress said that if he and the world politics were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, dinner with him, to be behind his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandel's hand.
I found out that when I print your hand, I take your energy, it moves, and I felt I know how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon forms in a film of Françoise Pienaar, the captain of the national football team in which white players were overcome.
The actress said he had six months to prepare for his role in the hard world of football.
The great surprise for him was finally when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember the ringing of the home bell, he opened me, and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was, "I look much bigger in the movie."
Despite the clear differences in the characters of actors compared to their real designs under the leadership of Eastwood, Invictus was received: Unsupported positive reviews and also talks about ambitions on Oscar.
The film critician of Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summarized his evaluation into the words: "It was a very good story, a very well done film."
In film reviews on the rottenomatoes.com web site, Invictus received 76% of the positive ratings.
Secrets of light over Norway: Russians tested the missile
The special light effect of unknown origin could be observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence just admitted yesterday that near the Norwegian borders, they tested an intercontinental balistic missile.
But the start was a failure again and the shot marked as the type of "Bulava", which was originally the Russian army, becomes a black sea of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in missile tests had no appropriate effect on the success of test flights.
The boulava hasn't even flyed or damaged in the air.
The Russian newspaper already says "Bulava" is like a missile that's not flying.
A rocket that doesn't fly but lights
This one in the order of the 13th attempt was conducted normally at the beginning.
On the end of the flight, there was a renewed technical damage to the apparatus.
Apparently the engine exploded at the third degree of missile.
This time, "Bulava" launched from the atomic submarine Dmitrij Donsky, which swimmed under the White Sea.
Because this type of missile allows fire from a ship that is in movement and at the same time flooded.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by a nearer undetermined flying object was really broken by "Bulava".
Otherwise, the Norwegians had no doubt that it was a Russian missile since the first time.
The Generals are defending themselves this time and argue that it cannot be clearly spoken of failure.
Because the first two degrees of missiles have endured, and the accident has occurred to the third.
In previous cases, engines were disrupted immediately in the first degree.
Although no test start has been completed without error, the Ministry of Defence is only six of the thirteen.
Almost 50 per cent of the success of the generals is filled with optimism and so still claims that "Bulava" will fly without problems and even take up ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum weight of 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract in CSKA Moscow in 51 years
Legendary defender Vjačeslav Fetisov will be presented again in a professional hockey fight in 51 years.
The former world master, the Olympic winner and the holder of Stanley Cupu will help his CSKA team in need of Moscow and apparently enter the Friday duel of KHL against Petrohrad.
Fetisov, who ended his career at 40 years in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Dennis Kuljas got hurt, we need another defense.
Fetisov regularly trained and agreed to help the team.
We just need to solve some formal circumstances, quoted by the AP Coach of the Moscow Club Sergei German.
It's not clear yet whether the comeback of the famous hockeyist will only be involved in one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can raise the spirit of the other players, he stated the Germans.
So, according to the AP, Fetisov will become the oldest Russian professional hockeyist.
In NHL, he played the whole season for the Hartford legendary attacker Gordie Howe and wrote 15 goals and 26 associates.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockeyists in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold, seven titles of the world master, triumphed on Canada Cupu and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he twice raised Stanley Cup in Detroit's dress.
Since 2001 he is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai succeeded in the union.
The Hyundai car managers agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
Just because of the frequent overtime orders, the unions announced a strike emergency on Monday.
The speaker of the car Hyundai Peter Vanek confirmed it.
However, the leadership wishes to agree with the experts on another Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign on our production plan, it is essential, so it was designed voluntary overtime on Saturday 19 December with two shifts, said Vaňek.
The Server Seven.cz wrote that the company of employees who work on the Saturday shift offered a bonus 400 Kč.
They'll get it back on Saturday 28 November.
According to Vaňka, the company has decided to change the way employees motivate for the proposed overtime.
Either they have payments for overtime or they can choose a refund free on December 28th, and so we fall for a day to extend Christmas holidays, said Vanek.
Furthermore, all employees of the Saturday shift will receive paid ride and lunch.
Since overtimes were the most intense and most vulnerable point of view of the comments and complaints of experts, and the protesting employees, which last week stopped production, the leadership decided with the immediate validity of all overtimes for December, said Vanek.
The car employees were forced almost every day after an eight-hour shift to work a two-hour overtime.
After the signing of the Agreement, the Union shall revoke the strike emergency
The following meetings between the driving of the car and the experts are to be held on Friday morning.
The chief of the Union, Peter Cook, said on Wednesday, that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign the common document, they are ready to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation in the car was sharpened last week on Wednesday, where about 400 employees were spontaneously striking because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the wrong paying conditions and alleged queer.
The leadership opposed that overtime employees have to work to meet the requirements for car delivery.
The experts in their Monday announcement also demanded that no sanctions are affected by employees who interrupted production last Wednesday.
In the overtime area, the company's unions require to mitigate overtime work to minimum.
Furthermore, they want to pay the reward of 5000 crowns this year.
Hyundai's car is now employing 2,000 people.
The serial production company broke in November last year.
By September, she produced approximately 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200 000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also takes into account the 'poor' viruses of HIV
The Czech and German scientists are testing new compounds that can slow down the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also takes into account the viruses that have already obtained against immunity medicinal products.
In some cases, this fact overrides the fact that the compound on the normal variance of the virus does not affect as much as any of the medicines already available.
AIDS can't be healed yet.
However, a mixture of medicinal products that prevent HIV reproduction in the body may prolong significantly.
However, a number of side effects are being carried out.
Furthermore, the incomplete absorption of virus multiplication resulted in the development of so-called resistant viruses against which drugs are already ineffective.
The work of experts from three institutions of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, of the WCHT Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that the substances called metal carborates are affected by protein responsible for the multiplication of HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are compounds of pine, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come with new “eveloped” compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their connection to the virus protein.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-dimensional cells produced by pine, hydrogen and carbon are connected with a atom of metal, in this case cobalt.
Traitor and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein of HIV virus which is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV vaccination, there would not be mature infectious viral particles.
If we stop the HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemicals and Biochemy of Sciences.
In the work published in the Scientific Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe the series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are associated with a short organic chain that is further systematically modified.
Something weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of HIV-protease substances was tested in the researcher and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metal carborates on a normal variant of enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used medicines, but does not lose its effect for resistant variations against which drugs are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of the effect and their other features such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical adjustments, as well as of metalocarborans, makes interesting combinations for further studies to design effective medicines against HIV, says Paulina Rjezačová, head of the Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemical and Biochemy and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of Science.
A fight about the budget.
The head of ODS Mirek Topolanek has identified the approved budget for the next year as "scary" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider further existence.
The statement of the OSS was marked by the President of the Government as strong statements.
He's keeping time for analyzing.
Vice-President OPS Peter Neweather said that the concept of the official office with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Parties is obviously no longer working.
The President of the Government, according to the Time, must decide whether it will resist a minority in the House, which is to combat a growing deficit, or whether he is intending to function with a parliamentary left handicap.
Access to ODS and social democracy to public deficits is diametrically different, noted The Time.
The House adopted the budget for 2010, however with the left-handed amendment proposals for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House has increased the money for the payments of state employees, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's elevation to the proposals of social democracy was hidingly to increase the budget deficit.
The C.R. should handle the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, so satisfied the Government's wish that the modified budget is a less bad option than the budgetary provision.
Disappointment and vainness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of disappointment and sense of vainness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government would consider the current situation.
Untime is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened the departure of the function in the event of the adoption of amendment proposals, the situation could look different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota ordered himself Monday after the government to the Prime Minister.
He pointed out that he considers further resistance in the function.
The reason is that he disappointed in negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer is pronounced for further combating the deficit of the budget, they do not have time in the government to do the nominant of the ČSSD that has made changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will demiss if the House approves other laws of deficits that increase, such as those relating to hospital, retirement, or the novel of the service law.
Topolan: Ministers of Nomination of OS did not blame themselves
It's the matter of Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The Ministers Nominated ODS did nothing wrong, stressed the Topolanec in the US text report.
He recalled that in several ministries there are people reporting to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
The time underlined that if Fischer decides to resign on the principle of combating the highest deficit of public finances, "is absolutely logical and correct to resist the left majority that is currently in the House."
He said he can't count on support and tolerance of civil democrats.
I didn't think about it, and when it's real, I'm going to be devoted to it, told the journalists in the House of Defense Minister Martin Bartak, who was just nominated by civil democrats in the government.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to the European Council in Brussels this afternoon.
At the request of the Prime Minister of OS resigned
At the same time, he emphasized that the ODS would apparently vote against the revised budget if the Prime Minister of Civil Democrats did not expressly ask for the adoption of the budget.
We don't feel as orphans, we are not small children, and he responded to the question whether the ODS was not obsessed with the absence of the President in Parliament and the Czech Republic in political negotiations.
I didn't notice my voice would miss.
Since I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the next months, the Topolyans were going to be mainly the Bolsheviation of the House and the destruction of all positive things, the Topolanac himself responded.
According to the new order, the CD will ride less trains for almost the same ride
The Czech roads will cancel or limit some less difficult speeds and locations from 13 December, while other links will strengthen.

This year's account for regional railway: 200 million more
Rapidly orders and pays the Ministry of Transport, totally paying for so-called proof losses, will give the expenses the next year four billion crowns, as well as this year. The localities are ordering the Regions, totally paying for them next year eight billion crowns, with less than three billion countries contribute to the state.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The trails of a new 10-year contract have been made to the locals and speeders, and the contract has been always for one year.

Philippines are still detaining over 50 persons, children released
Today, in the southern Philippines, weapons were abducted by 75 people, including a number of basic school students and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP, which originally informed only of 65 kidnapped.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The abduction took place in the Agusan del Sur province.
Approximately 19 armed men said he used hostages as a live shield to escape from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the issue of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, armsmen belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is a armed component of the Communist Party of Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP Agency, the police were originally persecuted by the kidnapper for violence that demanded accounts between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, the province of Maguindanao was declared for the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre related to the elections to the governor's office, there were 30 journalists.
For suspicion of the participation in the massacre, the governor of this South Philippine province was arrested and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influenced house of Ampatuans.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But on Tuesday, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government.
The JAR story relates to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next days, the new Hollywood movie Clinta Eastwooda Invictus (the official name in Czech is Invictus: Unexposed), which is a part of the life story of the former President of the South African Republic of Nelson Mandela.
The role of a world-known warrior against apartheid has been made by Morgan Freeman, whom he said he chose Mandel for his creation years ago.
The man's role of a legendary South African champion in the rugby of Francoise Pienaar was made up by Matt Damon.
With a picture in the movies, they arise from the voices of critics and public
Nelson Mandela
The entire name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the South African Muvez.
In 1988 he received Saharov's prize for freedom of thinking, then in 1993 with de Clerk Nobel Prize of Peace.
The President of the South African Republic was in 1994-1999.
A great expectation, since it comes to the public at the time when the top of preparing for the world football championship in the South Africa, however, the media are shaking anxious reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants of the Montenegro Ruling Most.
According to the AP reporting agency, the announcements for a new film in JAR are currently positive, despite the numerous obstacles to the main roles of "proflected" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, according to his words, is proud of a new movie.
I've dreamed about that role for years, and I've been doing good for it.
I have also met with Nelson Mandela in person to, as it is said, draw up his energy, in a conversation after a celebrating film premier in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remind Mandel's personality and the message by film.
It's the story of the South African Republic, but it's about everyone, he added.
In the country's rugby team's coat
The photograph based on the book proposal of the British writer John Carlin with a freely translated name In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and a game that has given the nation a portrait of the South African Human Rights Person during his first presidential election period.
Thus, during the film, Morgan Freeman is trying to screw two racial and long years after a mutually defined group of populations, and, as in 1995, Nelson Mandela, he also plays an acting role in the South African National Rugby Shoes on the World Cup field that JAR won.
For entering the grass in a coat that was understood in JAR almost as something holy, Mandel scrubbed 14 years ago large sheep mainly of the white audience and acquired a recognition of the white population.
The football championship may be able to reconnect people to a nation, stated by the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in 1995 in the national team.
Whether the tense situation in the JAR improves, it will only appear.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, as in the recent LN conversation, the fan of the Christopher Dawson Rugby, who fled from the country, gave an example.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
In Lounsk, tens of millions of crowns are on fire.
The fire was caught in the morning by the transformer of Cheps in the divorce in the village of Highs in Lounsk.
In the fire, he's interfering with six troops, according to the speaker of the restraining troops, Lucas Marvan.
The firemen originally wanted to let the transformer burn, but later they re-evaluated the opinion and fire fires mixtures of water, pens and special exhaust substances.
The cause was a technical disturbance, an internal abbreviation of the transformer.
No one's been injured, the crash according to the speaker of the company Paula Mandata is not threatening the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated to dozens of millions of crowns, exactly counting it will succeed until the fire is completed.
The destroyed transformer will, according to Mandat, be replaced with a new one.
In ten years, nothing like this has happened in the company Chaps, the disturbance of this type is unique, complemented.
The supply of electric electricity was not interrupted, household functioning, offices, or companies did not affect the traphostation fire for northern Czech Republic.
A.s. Cheps operate in the territory of Czech Republic as an exclusive transmission system operator, electrical management 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, reconstructs and develops 39 divorced with 67 transformators transmitting electricity from transmission to distribution system and routes of a length of 4339 km.
The Janchura shall submit a criminal notification for the negotiation of three heitmans from the ČSSD
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Janchura, will present today a criminal notification to three social-democratic heitmans.
And on Michal Haška from the South Moravian County, Radko Martinka from the Pardubian district and the heitman of the Olomouck region, Martin Tessarik.
The Janchura reported it in the 20 minutes of the Radio Journal.
The complaint relates to the efforts of the company to operate regional train transport in certain regions.
But in the end, all regions signed long-term contracts with the Czech Roads.
All three heitmans attack us and talk about choosing biscuits, bringing a bid only for what they wanted.
He claims that we are more expensive than the Czech roads, which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech roads that were closed last week.
So there's nothing left to defend ourselves.
It's for a talk against the Student Agency, he said to the Radio Journal of Janchura.
At the same time, he stated that he had evidence from all countries that they did not take their steps in accordance with European law.
It therefore prepares an incentive for the European Commission.
The hash of the application of a criminal notification considers the further continuation of Mr Janchury's media show, which serves him as an unpaid advertising to his company and its own person.
I am, of course, ready to protect my good name and my district, and I will call on the same to other heitmans.
I assume that even at this occasion it is clear that it is Mr. Janchura, who manipulates the public and uses false and false arguments, Hashek said.
The Janchura announced last week that he invested several million crowns in the advertisement, which would warn the inappropriate step of the Regions.
He told the Radio Journal that the Christmas campaign would interrupt and continue after the New Year.
He stated that the campaign would be led against corruption as such.
The Campaign launched Janchura after the regions agreed to operate regional railway links with the Czech Roads and the procurement of about 150 billion crowns did not tenders.
According to Jancura, similar acts are illegal and in contrast with the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train transport in the regions, Janchur was threatened by the messenger for the CHSSD.
The only threat was that if we don't let it go, we can lose the bus license.
He was represented as a member of the CHSSD, and I know what the master is about, I will not say his name, he said to the Radio Journal of Janchura today.
Vaccination against tyres will be free and unnecessary
The vaccination against tyres from January will break experienced habits.
It should be first for the families free and unnecessary.
However, the voices are already called to make vaccine more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccine against the top of the tyres.
The Medicinal Institution already sets the maximum prices of vaccines to pay health insurance.
Experts are also clear in the vaccination process.
New vaccination
Free vaccines for August children
Since January, children who were born last August 2 and later can be checked freely against tyres.
The condition is that they haven't received any dose of vaccination yet.
Whoever started vaccinating last year or sooner, has to remune the other vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between 3 and 5 months of child age.
Last year, a quarter of the families volunteered their children to vaccine against their tyres.
Parents paid 1600 crowns for one dose and more.
Four doses are needed for the vaccination of the youngest children.
General experts estimate that health insurance provides 300 to 450 thousand crowns per year for vaccine doses.
However, it saves the treatment that children need without vaccination.
So far, he gave about 500 thousand a year for all the general vaccination of children.
The suppressed vaccine was introduced by the so-called Janot package.
Pneumokok causes middle ear inflammation, but also serious infection including brain blans and blood poisoning.
He'll die on a pneumococ infection in our hospitals for a year, up to 28 children in the age of 10 years.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the general vaccination of children against pneumococas approximately in 40 countries has been introduced.
Will vaccination be obligatory?
At the same time, there are views that this vaccine may be obligatory in the future.
Since January, it should be paid by insurance and innocent.
That the mandatory vaccine would be better, for example, the head of the Civil Association Naglas Rudolf Kalovski.
His association of tyre vaccines has been promoting for a long time.
The experts at the international conference that our association attended were not fully satisfied with having voluntary vaccination.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we're glad that we've managed to put this down.
I think that's the way we've got to go now, Kalovski said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination process against tyres.
At this point, we are not even considering it, said his speaker Vlastimil Sršeń.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, according to doctors
The Chairman of the Expert Society of Practice Children, Hanna Cabrnoch, admits that she has voluntary vaccination of her disadvantages.
If all children were expected, they could be considered to reduce the number of reversions "For the situation where this vaccine stands so high, we relatively understand the political decision that the vaccine was launched as voluntary," Cabrnoch said.
Experts expect that their babysitters will be vaccinated against tyres since next year, more than 80 percent of the fresh parents.
The vaccine against tyres is also broken in the fact that as the first general vaccination of children is prevailing from health insurance, not standing.
Insurances should spend money on prevention, save for another treatment, Cabrnoch explains.
The physicians will have to buy the substances themselves
However, it is related to the concerns of practical child doctors dealing with the shopping of vaccines.
According to the original intention, vaccines should be purchased by insurance and the doctors should receive the vaccines as provided by the State for other vaccines.
However, some Members were afraid that insurances could "extract money from health insurance".
Therefore, the doctors will have to buy the substances and wait for the insurance to pay them.
According to estimates, individual practical child doctors will invest in vaccines 40,000 per month, which is a significant sum.
It's not gonna be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
The American Artist's son stole in the museum
The son of a renowned American creator, Frank Frazetta, was accused of attempting to rob images worth $20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
The Pennsylvania Police stated that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught in loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
The named Mr. Frazetta and the other man used to break into the museum in Poconco Mountains Bagr.
Mr. Frazetta senior, aged 81 years of age, was celebrated by creating the forms of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time it happened, the artist was located in Florida, as the press agency Associated Press said.
The AP quoted the unnamed police officer who stated that Mr. Frazetta, younger, could be motivated by long-term family disputes.
In front of the police, Mr. Frazett issued a younger vow, age 52, that he did so to his father's instruction, "to get into the museum any way and move the images into the salad space," said the agency.
Mr. Frazetta, the senior, denied the grant of any consent as the Agency said.
Labourists are preventing planned tax growth
The Ministers defended the increase in tax and shortage of expenditure notified in the preliminary report on the budget against criticism by the opposition, businesses and commissions.
As Alistair Darling stated, Tory's "protracted" the possibility to show that they mean a serious delay in deficit deficit deficit deficit deficit to the time after elections.
Even the Chancellor got under fire because of low and medium-sized workers' infections.
According to his proposal, the increase of 0.5 % in social insurance and 1 % of the adjustment of public payments since 2011 is mainly in question.
Insurance on social insurance
The committees protested that the low income workers were punished for a recession that they did not blame and warn before "probles".
Social insurance is increasing - an increase of approximately 3 billion pounds per year - which caused the communities of entrepreneurs who stated that it was tax from employment, while it should be focused on renewal of the economy.
This increase, limiting these revenues over 20,000 pounds per year, affects approximately 10 million employees.
CERTIFICATION OF PBR
Social insurance shall be increased by 0.5 % since April 2011
The economic situation will worsen more than expected, by 4.75% this year
New taxation 50 % of banking bonuses
Increased 1% tax companies for receipts in small companies
Tax reduction for electrical vehicles and wind power plants
Increased pension measurement by 2,5 %
According to the estimates of the government's financial administration, some revenue of 30000 pounds will be reduced by 90 pounds per year and some revenue of 40000 pounds will be reduced by 190 pounds, while some revenues of 10,000 pounds will increase by 110 pounds.
The Ministers announced that their objective to reduce deficit by half to 2013 means "complicated decision", but insisted that 60% of the special taxes should be 5 % of the highest income.
The Minister of Finance, Stephen Timms, denied that the proposed increase in taxes and expenditure limits would be a "cap in the ocean" compared to what was needed to be done.
"There are large numbers, which allows us to reduce deficit by half, which is absolutely the basic requirement for the next four years," BBC said.
Mr. Timms said he was convinced that economic growth should take place at the breakdown of the year.
But the development of the prognosis for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of the necessary loans and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be discouraged after the Chancellor was forced to revise the previous amounts.
In his opinion, the decrease in the economy was 4.75% in this year - far worse than the decline of 3.5% foreseen in April - because the loans were 3 billion pounds higher than previously estimated.
Wasted opportunity'
Conservatives who launched a new promotion campaign on Thursday, warning against the "cress of debt" of labourers, marked the planned loan of 789 billion pounds of pounds in the next six years as unlawful.
The Ministers failed to present a credible plan, as it could be paid, added, "cinicically" postponed this decision until the time after the elections - which must take place until June 2010.
"They didn't add anything important to be done," said the shadow Minister of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do this, but they wasted it."
" All important notifications will be made after the elections if we win them "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labourists insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future scratches, unlike the Tory proposals that would want to reduce the deficit faster and more.
But the Liberal Democrats claim that the money gained by tax and spending should be used to support expenditure in the next year, not to reduce deficit, and argue that the plans are "built on sand".
The Political Commenter BBC Nick Robinson reported the timeout of the communication - for example, the above inflation will increase and there will be an inability to pay the doses in the next April - that this could lead to the accusation of the Chancellor in the election campaign if the money would be gained difficultly back a year later.
But labourists insist on providing special assistance if people are very needed and the situation will be revised on September 1, 2010.
Suspicious budget'
Although the ministers did not publish the expenditure details since 2011, the economies stated that it was clear that the reduction of public expenditure would only be the beginning of medium-term restrictions.
The Recognised Institute for Budgetary Studies noted that Chancellor's digits indicate substantial scratches in many areas, potentially include transport, high school and defence.
"It's really very painful yet," his director Robert Chote said.
"The highly important statements will come after the elections, if we win them," added Roger Bootle, economic advisor to the Deloitte Revior Accounts.
"It was a report on the suspect's preliminary budget, and the markets carry it out."
The FBI is conducting an investigation in 'American prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting an investigation in a prison in Pakistan with five Americans suspected of the connection to extremists.
Men were captured for attack at the house in Sargoda in the East Panjab province, as reported by the BBC of the US Ambassador in Pakistan.
The FBI reported that it was an investigation whether it was the same men who were declared missing in the last month in their residence in the state of Virginia.
The American Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stated that it was also about getting information about these men.
Three of them are reported as originating in Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestors and others come from Jemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in what conditions they were detained and under what circumstances they were delayed there," said Ian Kelly, speaker.
The FBI speaker Katherine Schweit reported that the agency was informed of the imprisonment and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We are cooperating with Pakistan's authorities to determine their identity and nature of their beginning here and whether they are really missing students," she said.
The Pakistan Embassy in Washington stated that men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
It stated that the house was always the center of local police interest and that there was no charge against arrested men yet.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillry Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, but the press agency Reuters stated that the United States must "cooperate much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in the discovery of the infrastructure of terrorism that entails the recruitment and training of persons".
The disappearance of these five students from home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Refusing amnesty for the Iranian tyrants.
The situation in respect of human rights in Iran is as bad as in the past 20 years, as the Amnesty International Group Transport Report states.
The report detailedly describes "commodities of torture" in the regime before and after the controversial presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened by rape.
Iran rejected the above criticism of this report on human rights.
The officials have identified this criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands were imprisoned and dozens were killed after President Mahmud Ahmadinejadad, which led to the largest street demonstrations from the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Dozens of them were arrested, and the prosecutors sentenced the last five persons to death.
Writing BBC in Teheran John Leyne, now located in London, stated that earlier in the protests, the highest leader of Ayatolah Alia Homeyni declared the inadequateness of some of the ways of torture and prohibited their implementation in the Karizak correction device.
But since then, almost no critics of legal power have been tolerated, as said our writer.
Incorrect confession
Amnesty International quoted the report of a 26-year-old student of the field of calculation technique Ibrahim Methari, who stated that he was accused of "working with Facebook" and protests against the results of the elections.
"They often beat me in the face," he said in his deposition.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, my neck, their head... threatened me with execution and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, the Amnesty said.
In August, the presidential candidate Mehdi Charrubi was detained after the protests and was tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
Iranian higher officials rejected the charges of rape, but admitted torture.
Amnesty also indicated the case of a former prisoner who stated that he was held in the container with 75 other persons for more than eight weeks in prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and justice established committees for the investigation of eligible concerns and reaction of the government, but stated that the mandate and authority of the authorities were incorrect and the findings of parliamentary committees had been published.
The group stated that at least 90 persons were detained in the last three weeks in order to prevent further demonstration.
A ski scroll was created in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow was used to convert the memorial in Bristol into the season race.
The conventional race in the park attracted 16 semi - professional skiers and snowbordists to compete for financial prices.
At the top of the Station Road in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short skip bridge 100 m ago of the long highway.
The student of the fourth year of medicine John Hickman said that it was a beautiful view from the top of the highway, but that it was really creepy.
It was a beautiful view of the blinking lights of the city downstairs.
There were some of the best skiers and snowbordists from all over the country -- some of them are real talents," he added.
Prices were made for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the highway.
After the Thursday night race, the snow was left to cut apart.
Still they and we
Can he be a Muslim French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the secular state.
At the time the Swiss voters called after the ban on the construction of minarets and generally broadcasts the warnings of alleged islamization of Europe, John Bowen, the American academic wrote and informed and wondered whether Muslims could integrate - and whether they were integrated - into one of the most open secular companies of the continent.
Some of the readers, after reading this book, became the admirers of the author's last work, "Why the French do not like tags on their head" (2006), this elegant and discussed study on issues that they have divided and employed the country for 15 years and whose impacts are still experienced today.
The last book of Mr. Bowen has a wider and much more ambitious recording.
As a good anthropologist wants to know not only what politicians and media reported about Islam in France but what really happened in the foundation.
He spent all months in meshits, schools and institutions that are now taking care of 5 £ 6 million of French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He's a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students about questions that most disturb them.
Should Muslim enter a marriage bond in a messenger or in the council (or in both places)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about the development and gay rights?
Can the Muslim marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Is Muslim right to use an interesting banking system to get mortgage?
These are the seemingly worldly disputed issues that are being discussed and which are part of daily life rather than political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of possessions, teachers and intellectuals, among others generally known persons, not exclusive Tarik Ramadan, Arab, Muslim researcher and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open a debate about how good Muslim and a good citizenship in modern secular society can be at the same time.
They have no arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are untrusted to the real idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophy and activists with whom Mr. Bowen interviewed are attached to the scenario that it is the antipopolies of Selafi – the fans of Purity Sunni Islam, associated in Saudi Arabia – this group is small, but affects European Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromise on both sides.
He asks himself how far the French politicians (and the intellectual elite that defends the laic public) are truly devoted to the idea of pluralism.
The view is that the Muslims are likely less experienced in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to compromise historical compromise with secular republicanism.
Rather than the development of pragmatism, he found out "shooting of values".
After reading this book, someone may be inclined to say "Yes, but not now."
The world’s most uncomfortable prospects
The arctic change is more dramatic than the other planet's environment.
The limiting ice has a alarming speed, which affects animals and their survival as nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural water sources, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers during their waking.
Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, in the book "On a thin ice" is facing the natural history of the North's icon, a polar bear.
A well-known complicated history and whaling procedures describes the long tradition of polar researchers who were trying to earn a white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson with a brave 14-year-old swimmer who only fought the musket is really a myth, but everything else is true.
The young bears who were swimming for the bodies of their just killed mothers were caught and sent to the zoo and circus.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears appeared suddenly in a circus state.
Even today the zoo gardens have a typically million times smaller area than the area available by adults in the wildlife. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.
After clicking here, you'll find more!
Mr. Ellis draws from the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Even though the hunt is forbidden in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greece and Canada, where they hunt from helicopter and the Indians on the skies and they are all armed with the executive towels to shoot their capability.
It's ironic that it happens in the water north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book "On the ice" Alan Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and unconsolved responsibility for science for the Arctic and a boundaway long view of how the future can change it.
Not everything the scientists have answers.
Even meteorologists and oceanographics have no adequate response to the speed of change.
It's for lack of tests.
The research roads of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century first indicated how the ice floating is going.
The submarines for cold wars then maped the slides when they were floating.
Satellite surveys and widespread fields of probes in floating ice supplement are a useful supplement, but many are still doing thanks to unsubstantiated individuals, camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson is observing the extremely fragile world of the falling system within the arctic ice, which is produced by salt water, which is crushed during the freezing.
But from the expense of that bear to microscopic miracles, it is all condemned to disappear when the summer ice moves, which sometimes happens between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... that can be us.
6000 seamen have put the vein on the graves in Arlington
De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to put a simple vein on the grave of a soldier who never met.
For him and other marines who took a journey from Johnson's camp to Jacksonville to North Carolina to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate the graves, this was the day when he gave up the holding to men and women who used to wear the same shoe.
In a few months, when we get on the boat, we can be the ones, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If that happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me in order to show respect for me as I am trying to do.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to put the veterans on the cemetery of veterans in several departments at the Arlington Pete Act.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester's funeral company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Pete Act.
It is now 18 years old tradition when Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen take this trip every year and stop in different cities along the road to honor the memorial of the members of the army and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters are not looking for profits across America, which are also in other countries.
In this year, volunteers put over 16,000 cities on the Arlington cemetery, in the territory of Pentagon, on the graves at the National Cemetery Fayetteville in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City, and at a memorial location of 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, Walmar's foundation has been devoted to more than $150,000 for shopping and transporting the veins.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she took a trip to Arlington to honor her husband, a dead member of armed forces.
Because her husband wasn't buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said that it was her way to return what the victim was doing.
It's a small way that citizens can support our units, she said.
It's like a family grave visit.
The volunteers walked through the cemetery in the coats of the warm substance after the surrounding grave and hills.
Volunteers headed to the older graves from the first and second world war and from the war in Vietnam, because they are not visited as often as new graves
The mood was positive when the children played and held their hands together when they transported a young pine to the stones of the grave.
Each circuit vein was darkly green with a small red sheet of wheels on top.
Nearly in section 60, where most veterans from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, they remained silent.
The Joint Services Organizations devoted 1,000 branches to decoration the department, but the cloudful mood of wars just filled this area.
Some cried sincerely, others prayed, and families, and friends kept each other in a cold air.
Some read the names loudly, derived into stones, while others were shy to look at small black white names put in the wet mud where the grave stones were not yet placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who washed tears from their eyes in front of their son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the sergeant's last rest of the sergeant's artillery of David Shane Spicer, who fell in the fight in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. ..my son paid for it, the rules.
"Although I've been away for a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
American government supplier imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has imprisoned an American government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, as officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs introduced on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, has worked for the company Development Alternates Inc. with a seat in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the American Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the American Interest Section in Havana, were looking for access to the detainee who was imprisoned on December 5th.
Specific charges have not been published, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner may be imprisoned for almost anything that is referred to as "dangerous".
All so-called contrarevolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical states, are causing a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-governmental graffitis and speeches are considered to be serious crimes.
There is a young bloging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are monitored and disturbed by government agents.
Mrs. Sanchez repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country so she could take the prices, but her permission was rejected.
The detention of an American supplier may be the result of a growing tension between the Communist Caster Brother, ruling in Cuba, and the Obama Administration, which was followed as a "restraint tactics" in improving relations with the island.
They first reported the New York Times prison on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasized that if the Cuban government takes specific steps, such as release of political prisoners and create more space for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and searchable commodities in the country where the average pay for the state employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has given ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are used mostly by sending text messages because the 15-minute phone call would cost more than one day's remuneration.
Use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to log in must announce their names to the government.
Access to many websites is disabled.
Detention of Americans in Cuba is rare.
Most of the U.S. citizens in Cuba prisons are behind networks for drug trafficking, Gloria Berben, the Press Office of the Department for American Interests in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about prison.
Detention and detention were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open company - let's give it free mobile phones - are in Cuba criminal offences, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the American Human Rights Programme, who recently published an unfavourable report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, Cuba, the same," as an instant on the installation of Raula Castra as the leader of the country and the refund for a sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco stated that the defendants were often arrested, convicted and imprisoned in one day.
He stated that all solutions would be rather political and that the Cuban government often provokes negative reactions in the United States, just when these two countries are heading towards a larger dialogue.
Pakistan's public administration employees have a conspiracy on the transmission of men to Afghanistan.
The Pakistanian authorities revealed on Saturday the alleged conspiracy leader on sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill members of the American units, and said they hoped that this case could help to disclose a wide network of terrorists who are following the Internet and searching for radicalized young men.
The investigators stated that they were looking for grey rebels, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after he first discovered them when one of these men published a comment that approves terrorist attacks has websites of YouTube.
Saifillah took the lead of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, he tried to help them get into the distant area of Pakistan in the area of the native tribes of Pakistan, which is the home of al-Qaeda and its camps for the training of terrorists.
But the Pakistani rapporteur who reported the case said on Saturday that Saifullah was failed to convict commanders of al-Qaeda and that men were not part of the CIA attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were planted in a few days to the east of Sarghoda, far from the threatening mountains in the northwest, which became a refuge of terrorists.
They were considered a strike unit.
The reason why they were expelled was stated by the official who spoke of preserving anonymity in relation to the sensitivity of the case.
The official stated that men were not intimidated and were still trying to obtain consent for access to al-Qada camps when they were arrested by the execution of Pakistanian law.
The case of this five -- which remained in Pakistan and was interrogated by the FBI -- emphasizes the critical role of the retainers in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, which is much more important, the designation of the trustee.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US Intelligence Service has assigned the highest priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qada.
Organists act as guards, excluding those who are not serious enough in their commitment to holy war and those who could be investigators.
The American false recruitors were subjected to a special study in al-Qaeda, the analysts reported.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group, because, given their potential approach to American goals and their promotion value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation with the US residence, said that terrorist groups have also become significantly cautious in the recent years of being able to access them because the US reporting agencies have acquired experts on their methods.
If we are trying to get into these groups, is there not a better way than to follow their model that has already been monitored? Mr Kohlmann said.
This model is one of those that are much more based on the web.
Thousands of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanded climate action.
Twenty thousands of protesters walked around the streets this Saturday and demanded more emphasis on climate than negotiators in Bella's city convention centre.
The protesters indicated the number of hundreds of thousands of participants in this event, but the police rejoice that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively calm and a bunch of masked activists placed several small places near the government building group in the center of the city.
On the day a small event occurred in the interviews of the United Nations, thousands of activists passed through the city and carried transparency with English inscriptions "This is not a planet B" (i.e. second order) and one in Spanish, which said "The Earth says "dost."
The protest took part in several celebrites, including the Danish model and photographers of Helena Christensen, who stated that she traveled to her mother's parents in Peru and provided me with information about the uncomfortable state of the country in which the impact of climate change continues to occur.
That is a partial reason why we decided to join this great march -- to walk through the world and appeal to the leader of the world's personality to submit a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not a easy task, but it's necessary to be performed, it can't be avoided.
The police prevented the protesters from approaching the center of Bella and said that they held 19 people, first of all because they had either masks or pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstration.
According to one of the non-participating viewers, who do not want to be identified because he is involved in climate rogues, activists masked as sportsmen and put several places in black clothing near the Copenhagen main channel, located near several ministries.
They agitated at the buildings, he said, they started with lightlights, but then followed "a few big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not enter the awareness of key officials, such as Su Weie, the main Chinese climate negotiator.
When he was asked whether the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he answered English "Actually, that is something I was not aware of" (really it is something I don't realize).
Then he continued in Chinese and said, "Because the story is large, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He was watching if the march was painful or helpful depending on the prospects of everyone.
The focus of the broad public and different sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words, "I can also say that it is a breach or freedom of others.
The test data revealed continuous persistent racial differences
The federal certificate from the last week on the achieved knowledge of mathematics was a welcome element of good news about the public education of the district of Columbia.
Although the district remains far behind the highly performance systems of the country, the certificate has shown greater progress in the fourth and eighth classes in the last two years than in the cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers of the National Assessment Centre for Progress in Teaching is the continuing differences in the achieved knowledge between African and white students, both local and national.
The average result of white students of the fourth classes of the Colombia district in the past two years increased from 267 to 270 points (of possible 500), but only three points increased from 209 to 212.
The difference in knowledge achieved has actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
Progress in the Africans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a statistically unsignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The average result in white students was not included in the results of the test because the sample size was not sufficiently large.
The picture in the horizont of six years is not very encouraging.
The difference between white and black students of the fourth grade in 2003, when the first NAEP in the district was performed, was 60 points of the degree (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved in both groups were improved during this period, the difference was hardly nearing 58.
Some advocates of education in the district last week expressed that the results, celebrated by Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fentym (D), were more stimulated in white students where the results were already high.
This would suggest that we have increased the amount of support of those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, executive director D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends the equality of empowerment in the district.
I'm not jumping up and down for two or three points, said a member of the Committee of D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Eaton basic school.
Frequently criticizing Mrs. Rhee's management style, Mrs. Brown said that the report on the results of the test means high school in the city is in desperate state and requires attention.
It's obvious that you always want to see the claws, and I respect it.
But what's terrifying is that we haven't spent almost any time and energy that we needed to devote to our high school.
Mrs. Rhee said the efforts of the district were to continue looking for better ways focused on the needs of students with low results.
In this case, for example, some teachers are trained to use new bases of reading, Wilson’s reading system, focused on students of high school classes and high school students who have failed to manage the basis for reading earlier in their career.
Daily mathematics and basics of mathematics to the sixth grade, emphasizing the games and experiences of real life that reached the district as former director Clifford Janeyi, can be added to the NAEP progress top, which was given the report last week.
And I think we should continue to work and do the best interventions in those students who remain under class level, Ms. Rhee said.
Others stated that the results of NAEP explained whether Ms. Rhee could continue to increase the overall performance of the system and continue to provide additional money and funds for schools with low performance, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It is a certain dilemma of Mrs. Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley where she studies the results of urban tests.
The conventional correction procedure is to focus funds and administrative reforms on schools placed in the worst parts of the Colombia district.
Thus, focusing can bring political sounds that aim against the important agenda.
But the lift, of course, belongs to other urban directors who are trying to maintain a medium range between white and black.
We need to focus on building the system of large schools.
We must exploit our schools’ relatives so that all families, no matter where they live, can trust that their children will be given excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now the Director of Newark Schools, said this week in an interview that the main element of reducing the difference between the achieved results is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district to achieve the power of schools.
You have to get up to 200 days to make changes, Mr. Janey, who concluded the contract with his association of teachers for the school year last 185 days, which is considered "sign" for finding a greater increase in the next year.
To make higher education a part of the better future
The race bus drove to the Gettysburg Railway with a loud breathing.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, came out and rested on white columns, bricks and smaragd green grass.
Graciela's parents barely graduated high school in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the railway land.
Now she and other eighth grade students in the group were exploring Gettysburg, where the school cost $38690 a year, their position was rather than the frightened visitors of the excited potential students.
That's it! called Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? the rules were thoughtful when they were given a low relationship of teachers to students.
The Pennsylvania railway was one of the seven who visited their classroom and were now fully obsessed with the future report: The question is not whether you enter the railway.
The question is from where.
Of course, this is a nose problem with the high number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who are expelled from high schools or pregnancy as teenagers, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive another education and thus enter high schools.
In fact, the fifth of this "long generation" of Spanish students from the railway - the remarkable achieved results suggest that many of their immigrant parents, most Mexicans and the inhabitants of Central America, have arrived in the United States without finishing high school.
Their story of success is important, according to researchers, because it underlines their way forward for a generation that played a border role in the fields of the country's workforce.
Those who have achieved high school education say that they had natural affection for school and inherent inhumanity and efforts to achieve success.
Many parents also had high targets for their children and searched for ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciela and millions of children who would like to graduate a railway - especially if these efforts last in time.
If we consider that children are from low-income groups whose parents have no experience and ability to help them normalize themselves in the system, any simple intervention at each point will not solve it, says Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American area.
We have to think about providing these children with a grid in pre-school age in all ways to pursue high school.
The Federal Programme that funded Graciela's railways is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (application) provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch further preparatory programs starting for students from small income groups in high schools and continues until these students finish high school.
Since 1999, this programme has served more than 10 million students, of whom more than% has entered the railways, according to the US Ministry of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industries has reached agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of the fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to reconstruct a significant oil company during two auctions held on Saturday.
Ten agreements concluded by the Iraqi Oil Industry Ministry with foreign oil companies, which suggests that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in renewing the Iraqi oil industry, covered by decades of war and sanctions.
The American companies left with capital participation just two of the 10 outraged fields.
Seven American companies paid for the second auction that started on Friday.
Only one made a lost offer.
Two American companies reached agreements on the fields that were irritated in June.
The participation of American oil giants in an open Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and instead of American companies you have here first on the road of Asia and Europe, said Ruba Husari, editor Iraq Oil Forum, online reporting.
It'll be a long time before anything else is sold in Iraq.
The concerns of security, emphasized by massively coordinated bomb attacks on Tuesday and political instability, as the downloading of the US army, are likely to disturb American companies from much more intense business in Iraq, which has clearly the third largest raw material reserves, say analysts.
In some cases, American companies were in disadvantaged, in particular Chinese and other governments controlled by energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more inclined to risk because they do not respond to shareholders.
The Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that concluded agreements with the Ministry.
The front companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintained close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industries and offered technical assistance in the past years, left with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts allocated at the end of this week.
China's National Petroleum Corp. participated in offers for more contracts than all other companies and left with large shares in contracts on two main fields.
We all know that China strives to become the main economic force, as technology force, said the speaker of the Ministry of Oil Industries Assam Jihad.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be comparable to competition and are worthy of its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were previously selected to submit offers, which were then compared by the Ministry according to the price of the barrel and the Ministry are willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current level in each field.
The al-Kayda planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
During the impact of an American missile on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, it was apparently killed by a top planner of operations al-Qaeda, as the US anti-terrorism Division announced on Friday.
As confirmed, it could be the second death attack on one of the highest terrorists' leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several missiles hit their car on Thursday near Miran Sah in the North Vaziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistanian officials in the area.
Local authorities have informed that missiles were fired out of a plane without a type crew operating with the CIA in the zone of illegal domestic tribes.
These were indicated to the white car that was heading towards the Afghan border when he was hit, the official stated with the Pakistanian citizen interrogation agency who was calling from Miran Shah.
The official stated that local weapons have accompanied the point and quickly entertained what remained from "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the victim's identity, but two American anti-terrorism officials quoted an unspecified witness who stated that Somali was a death poison.
Somali was introduced as a highly constructed planner of military operations al-Kaida, who was running the operations of terrorist groups outside of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in the world's creation, said a higher official who does not want to be appointed, who has indicated the sensitive nature of American air strikes in Pakistan.
If he was in such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from Al-Kaida's highest leadership and planned possible terrorist attacks based on them.
Another US official said that Somali was rapidly acting in the al-Qaeda hierarchia and was well connected to other extreme groups in the region.
He must not be a generally famous person for some Americans, but that he did not in any way humiliate himself to post before us and our allies, said another official.
When his death was confirmed, Somali should be the second highly built leader of al-Qaeda or Taliban who should be killed since September, when at a similar attack, the Namudin Jalolov, the leader of the military fraction in the area of the native tribes and three other top-operative leaders was killed.
The rate of attacks launched by the ClA through pilot aircraft has been reduced from the average summer of approximately six operations per month to two, according to Log of Long War, websites managed by an unprofit group.
The reduction may have a reason for improving terrorist tactics, which have made steps to reduce their vulnerability by also unjustly killing people who have suspected that they are informants, the site stated.
The United Nations Supreme Delegation in Cabulu departed.
The United Nations Supreme Delegation in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would want to retire from his position in March and end such a violent functioning period that was detrimented by the charges of large corruption in the election of the President in Afghanistan, supported by the UN.
Eide's departure is happening because Obama's administration decided to send another 30,000 American soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations delegation stated that it supported growth, but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for reducing the state, which starts in 18 months, should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO countries to withdraw their powers.
We need to accelerate the construction of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans to trust in the international community, he stated Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment accepted must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pushed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian employees assisting in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
Increasing on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said that he did not leave, but that he simply fulfilled his promise to his family in March 2008 that he would spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has now stated that he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it's time to look at the follower, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has launched a search for replacement.
The officials stated that it is decided between Staffan di Mistura, who has Swedish-Italian origin and has previously led the UN mission in Bagdad, and Jean-Maria Guehenn, France, who had before it conducted peace operations of the United Nations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won in the earthly presidential elections from masking the presence of massive elections.
Eide denied this claim, but he stated that the charge of Galgraith -- which was released -- "decisively damaged the mission, because there was a high degree of scope with regard to international intervention" in the election.
Eide stated that he proposed a meeting with the highest representative of citizens to coordinate the relief of efforts in the management of the United States forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to rent them for the Afghanistan mission, and he said he would want to strengthen their confidence that their money is needed properly.
Eide expressed disappointment over the limitation of his efforts in Afghanistan and stated that the UN heavy employment regulations undermine its ability to use its capacities.
The rules of the United Nations are such that I had the opportunity to get only one person since May, he said.
It's a disaster, and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces other sanctions
Robert M. Gates, Minister of Defence, said on Friday that the world's powers will soon put on Iran "other significant sanctions" because of the lack of engagement in the conversations on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq during the weekly journey on the areas of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, batalised the prospects of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to the question of the soldier on the likely development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I have learned something from Iraq in the past six years, [this] is an unpredictable unforeseenness in the war.
Obama's administration decides on a package of sanctions that could affect the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of these sanctions could also be affected by ordinary Iranians.
He said that "the package of incentives and restraints" would require "to make the Iranian government feel really less safe with nuclear weapons" because "her inhabitants will be exclusively suffered" by sanctions.
According to the Friday opinion issued by the speaker of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration has included the European leader in warning that Iran will bear serious consequences if it does not fully comply with the UN Nuclear Safety Committee and its supervisory Authority, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that he wants to develop his expertise only for peaceful purposes.
During the Geneva talks on October 1, he pointed out that he wanted to return to the discussions on the restriction of his nuclear programme and agreed that he would provide a major part of his wealthy uranium stock in exchange for urgently necessary fuel for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The administration has been established for such an agreement as a way to establish confidence between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to be derogating from temporary agreements - partly why, the expert states, because Irish leadership is divided in view of whether to engage in the United States.
Honestly, if it concerns the Iranian stubbornness against the international community in the case of some of the proposals he really agreed at the beginning of October, I think it has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese together to the road, which is not for the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set a final term for Iran on December 31, to answer proposals before he returns to search for other elections, including monitoring, which the Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions".
In the opinion issued in New York, the Iranian mission in the United Nations condemned on Thursday what it called "unreasonable and unfounded charges" before some members of the Security Committee on Iranian nuclear activities and stated that he wished to continue interviews with the United States and the five other world powers "to achieve a reasonable long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before he flew to Kurdistan, rich in oil to meet soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
It lasts high tension between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, especially because of borders, property rights and income division.
Gtes urged both parties to reduce conflict potentials to prevent US plans to limit the number of US soldiers from 115000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to eclipse the Kurdish concerns of the persistent depression. The U.S. official places quoted Gates when he told Massoud Barzaani, President of the Kurdish regional government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In aging China, change in course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew surrounded by propagandistic posters on which they read that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to take more children" and "One child means one more grave."
Then they learned that when official government seats in Shanghai, alarmed by low birth and ageing the population in their city, suddenly changed the course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never.
We always devoted all our time and energy to one child.
We didn't keep anything for others, says Wang, 31, the managing of human resources, who has an 8-month son.
For more than 30 years of the last policy of China to have only one child has been introduced and has created two generations only noorically boubelled and screwed children, which are, in effect, called "small emperors", the country is threatening the population crisis.
The average birth rate decreased to 1.8 children per pair in comparison with six before politics entered into force, according to the UN data.
The population division, where populations aged 60 years and higher are predicted to grow from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This is far above the total average of about 20 per cent.
Inequality is more rich coastal cities with high school education, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and were higher in Shanghai, almost 22 percent of the registered inhabitants, while birth was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning, said that many couples must have children to "help to reduce the proportions of the ageing population and to reduce the number of working forces in the future".
He says it's about "being old, it doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries, such as Japan or Sweden."
Consolidated calming
As put into the country's constitution in 1978, one child's Chinese policy is probably the most controversial mandate established by the Governments of the Communist Party.
The two who violated politics faced enormous penalties -- up to three times their annual salary in certain areas -- and the discrimination at work.
The Chinese official sites promoted a policy that helped the country to prevent criticizing natural resources, while the human rights defenders were convicted in promoting policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women at the second child to submit to abortions.
Furthermore, many couples had to act sexistly selective abbreviations leading to unnaturally high men’s relationship with women.
In the past years, the population officials were gradually mild in their opinion on one child's policy.
In 2004, they generally authorised exemptions -- including towns, members of national minorities and cases where men and women were single -- and in 2007 they mitigated the dictions of their passwords, promoting a hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research of the Peking University, said that the central government officials had before discussed radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children, unless one of the partners was a single.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city that launched an aggressive campaign to incite more births.
Almost overnight, posters, encouraged parents to have only one child replaced by copies of regulations detailing how the second child would be authorized and how to ask for permission.
The city administration sent family planning officers and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and put them under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, the family planning officials indicated.
Answering response
Even though officials in a village city in the area of Shanghai have recorded an increase in interest in couples that would like to have a second child after the campaign, most urban districts have not reported any changes.
The Huinan City District with 115000 population, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
The disappointed officials in Shanghai stated that, despite the campaign, the number of born in the city in 2010 is still expected only about 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but less than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in the Shanghai Quartet of Caolu, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people don't want to have more children.
They want to provide the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juungan, 26 years old, said she would like two children, and it was legally permitted.
But like many Chinese who only have insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without the incidence network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the west view the politics of one child as a disputed legal issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant in the seventh month of pregnancy with the first child.
Yes, we were deceived about the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It's about money.
Other couples indicate psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the managing of human resources, says they want only one child, because she was also the only one: "We were the center of the attention of our families and we were all taking care of us.
We were not used to provide care and we really didn't want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who puts on the translation company, expressed it much more incredibly.
For two career parents from the high-class that reduced birth, he said, to be successful means to be selfish.
Today, 20 and 30 years of age, adults view parents as the first days of the Czech experiment with capitalism and do not want to feed for themselves, he says.
Just one child puts in a huge demand for parent's time, he says.
Mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still disputed issues of space -- "You have to stop your apartment" -- and strategies -- "You must have resumes ready when the child is 9 months for good pre-school education.
Most of his friends want to satisfy one child, says Che, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher food standards, he says.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
The UN Group has shaded the emission reduction plan.
The United Nations sponsored Conference on Climate -- characterized by far-discriminated positions and mutual conversion -- again focused on the release of a document on ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases during the next 40 years with industrialized nations, which are not most of the burden in the nearest term.
The text that can provide an exit for the final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulations emphasizes the remaining obstacles as illustrates the way forward.
But there was an important progress in negotiations that took place in the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc working group, this text unduly states how much money the rich countries should provide to the poor to deal with global warming shortly and long-term.
And it provides a whole range of elections for key issues, including how to develop and manage the emerging economies so that they can limit their carbon output and what the upper limit of global temperature growth should be, which political actors will still be able to tolerate.
This delivers a large dose of flexibility, says John Coequyt, the highest representative of the Washington Club Sierra.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, declined from 180 pages of the text in the negotiation to focus on what the top Climate Officer in the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, described as "great image".
It sharpens the margins for a possible agreement where industrial nations could reduce their emissions together to 25 to 45 per cent in comparison with 1990 levels, while the main developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 per cent during this period.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions to 2050 between 50 and 95 per cent.
The European Union has accelerated the promise on Friday that it will provide $3.6 billion in the next three years to help the poor countries adopt adaptation to climate change -- from coping with floods and drought until preventing the forest.
However, on Friday, he stated the same type of verbal fireworks that were overcome in the interviews last week.
The U.S. Special Ambassador for Climate Affairs, Todd Stern, rejected a speech which requires mandatory restriction on greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries compared to voluntaryness in major developing economies if they were not financed by the developed world.
The movement signaled that Obama's administration set a harder line towards China to be Bush's administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not accept a contract without transfer of main developing countries and action, said Stern, who also complained that the text is not sufficient to secure restrictions and should be verified by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei informed the U.S. main negotiator of climate issues that either the lack of "settlement reason" or "extreme non-response" had led before a week to the communication that the United States would not financially help China to deal with global warming.
With the future of the economic path of the main world powers in the bet, the tags broke both within the development world and between the industrial world and the economies developing.
The current struggle is a majority of preserving individual economies rather than preserving the planet, between China and the United States on the fulfilment of their respective obligations, while the poor nations notify that two dozens of the world's most influenced countries ignore a scientific impetus to carry out more important actions.
Ricardo Ulate, the delegation of Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the main powers are fighting for who should bear the cost of the restriction of greenhouse gases, while the vulnerable countries became much more aggressive in searching for the way to prevent large emitters responsiblely in their actions.
It is a clear game that a new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, which also serves as a regional advisor in the field of regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature protection.
Some countries that are the most vulnerable impacts of climate change suggested that they would want to continue promoting a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants said that the best result of the interview would be a political agreement.
The alliance of small island countries with 43 members created a 24-page agreement last Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, who conducted international climate negotiations for the benefit of the European Commission, said that the promotion of small island nations "provoked a political pressure to the whole politics process" partly because they are now united and require action from growing economies such as China and India.
The proceedings raised a new urgency as soon as the delegates focused on the fact that they had to address most of the remaining issues before the heads of the governments faced the agreement.
High-level officials, such as the Indian Minister for Environment Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, have exited the aircraft and ran the Halls of Bell's centre to the closed doors of the meeting and the new conferences, so they could emphasize the rights to be assessed next week.
The total scale of the meeting - when 13,000 people moved every day from and to the congress center, the guitars playing activists inscentized the ironic viewers on the countries they thought they had sent them, and there were proposals from hand to hand on paper rather than electronic mail - controlled by the challenge.
Intensity is only a building: nearly all key ministers were present in Copenhagen and earlier in the middle of 60 heads of the States.
We entered high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Deputy Minister for Global Policy in the International Nature Protection.
They're coming tough weights.
The British first train with speed 140 miles per hour redefinied this Monday's feelings
at 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, the whistle cut the darkness on the sign of the departure of the train, which meant a transport revolution in Britain.
The first high-speed personal train in the country reaches a speed of 140 miles per hour and flys from Ashford to Kent to London St Pancras and crosss the distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and entered the first high-speed personal composition outside the lLdines.
He hopes that the new service will connect Britain with the international network of rapid, reliable trains and connect the great aglomeration of Midland, north and Scotland with London.
The limited standing waters should reduce transport time in personal transport and on business roads and crossing from aircraft and railway cars could reduce car emissions and eliminate road trailers.
Theoretically, three major political parties have obtained this vision.
But dozens of billins of pounds needed to build a new national railway network, an imminent fight for projects and concerns about environmental disturbance have now impeded the construction of British high-speed tracks.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide a government's conductive study, gave his report to Lord Adonis on December 30, as the Times stated.
She gave him a detailed map of the route of another planned stadium of high-speed network.
The new tracing of London's connection with Western Midland was designed up to five meters in urban areas and quarters where the prospect of life could be problematic.
In the open land, it was planned to 25 m of the final route.
HS2 also assumes to determine three choices for a large high-speed network leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will answer the spring.
The preferred option is the configuration of the shape of letter Y, where one high-speed trail should lead to the West Midland.
The trail should be divided near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the second leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One trail should lead to Scotland.
"It seems to have been the most executive choice," said the railroad expert.
As soon as it's done, travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first phase that will not be opened before 2025 could allow travellers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in present.
The proposals should allow trains to drive at a speed of 2250 miles per hour, which would make the British network the fastest in Europe.
The starting track is already proposed to abduct trains within 400 m , which would be able to transport 1100 persons .
Once 18 competitors could operate every hour on the trail of London - Birmingham.
This means that the London Terminal would be able to operate if necessary up to 20000 passengers per hour.
In view of the capital limits, the existing station is expected to expand so that the high-speed network can be reached.
Training experts claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offers such a potential.
Lord Adonis will notify whether he is thinking or not to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not come before the general elections.
Even if it moves the wheels, the network should be built in parts.
The trains should first be launched, not on high-speed tracks, but already existing routes north of Birmingham and maintain travel time between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered to be a decisive contact point to ensure the transition from aircraft to trains, the orientation point for railway revolution.
The taxpayers paid the mortgage of 75,000 pounds on the Tory orangeries
Alan Duncan, the holder of the Tory seats in the Parliamentary House, paid thousands of pounds of expenses last year for the orangeries he built in his house in the electoral area.
The speaker of the party behind the prison, which was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the Members lived "from the awards", increased his hypothesis to 75,000 pounds to build a dust-coated expansion in his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, a total of hundred pounds per month to taxpayers.
General authorities approved their claims in time, so Sir Thomasen Legg was not interrogated by who was conducting control of the issuers. Last night Mr Duncan expressed his requirements "to be cleaner or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns two two floor houses at all in his electoral area Rutland and Melton.
The houses are worth approximately a million pounds.
There are kitchen, living room and dining room on the ground floor, but the financial office agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added a winter garden to the house, which is in the plans called "organgia".
The neighbours describe it as a "the fun glass and accommodation."
Mr Duncan has not been requested to provide any explanation for an increase in loan during the last check by the General Standards and Privileges Committee in the last comparison of the mortgage.
The Committee informed him last month that he violated the rules after the examination of his expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the pupilary security of the mortgage of 271406 pounds from his property in London to his electoral area, which he bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the Parliament.
The documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately 1400 pounds per month for mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds per month.
The interest in paying RBS of Mr Duncana mortgage could not change at this time, which suggests that all of this was intended to finance a loan of 75,000 pounds.
The standard RBS variable mortgage payment decreased in December 2007 from 7.94 per cent to 4 per cent in March this year, where it remained.
The last document of the general authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to claim 1250 pounds per month in May this year.
Mr. Duncan quit his work as a shadow leader of the House in September after a secret rapporteur filmed it and said the Members must survive "to award" after the scandal with expenses.
"It's basically nationalized, you have to live for appointment and treat you like a shit."
He said, "I spent my money for my garden and my claim and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim the whole goddamn share, but I won't do it."
The messenger, a millionaire of his former career as a oil trader, was first invited to explain his publications in May when it turned out to be claiming thousands of pounds for his garden, before the financial office approved, that "this could be considered excessive".
One of the activists dug a gap in the form of a libra mark in Mr. Duncana's grass to protest after he discovered that he had claimed 4000 pounds for three years.
When he was asked last night about an increase in mortgage, Mr. Duncan said, "It was because of the increase in capital, which was approved by both the financial office and then by Legg."
He added: "It is not a question of hiding and clipping or violating rules or something else.
It's absolutely equal to a line down, according to the rules, justified, and that's all.
It would not be much more clean or easier."
Come all carefully to see the cabin on the brighton coast with an adventure calendar.
The coastal houses in Brighton found a new meaning of life in winter months as an interactive adventure calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that induces the cultivation of creativeness, called for 24 owners to decorate their houses for every day in December, and to use Christmas wheels as the subject of this decoration.
The event began on December 1, when it allowed visitors to see the last chamber from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and the bishop’s bread and the wine delivered free.
The chosen holidays included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noil, when the chamber represented the work of Janetty Tozer, the local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, assistant at the Hove TV marketing, is a priest without scholarship in the chichester diet and leading Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion much more important for people in the post-Christian society.
"Why should we as a church expect people to come into a foreign old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in awakening way.
"The idea of an advent calendar in the chambers was just like a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic and pulsing place and we tried to present it in a spiritual way."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world against climate change.
Thousands of thousands of people came to the streets on Saturday with a demand for an important and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be adopted at the Copenhagen Conference, demonstrated throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where the police arrested hundreds of people at that occasion.
At least thirty thousand people according to police resources and 10,000 according to organizers showed in cold weather in the Danish capital at the occasion of the United Nations Conference on Climate, aimed at adopting an agreement on Friday, which could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, declared that the growing global mobilization, whose clear evidence is current manifestation, contributed to the "political tax" of possible failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to AFP journalist, incidents in Danish capital shortly after the start of the show, when about 300 demonstrators dressed in black began to break the exhibitions with plate bones and clays.
The order police immediately hit.
In general, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and stated that it was especially members of "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical separate groups that were already shown in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, Eastern France.
Coalice Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the action, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without difference" and emphasized that about a hundred of them were in leaflets and in the seat "holded in the streets on Saturday night" even over the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the passage peacefully went towards Bella Center, where the negotiations were held.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
For speakers, a stage was built before which a spiritual meeting was held at candles in the participation of the former South African Archbishop of the Cape city Desmond Tut.
Most protesters arrived by bus and trains from large European cities, and other than Africans there were a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Almost 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue coats, have created the first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning at the challenge of the Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create "blue waves" for "justice climate".
Today, we go to the streets to require a compensation for the ecological debt for the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine warrior from Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep saying, "That's the time," the Beninian singer Angelique Kidjo declared.
In Africa, rivers and water flows dry, and today we can walk in them, and that was never possible before.
For the first time in the history of the climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 by the adoption of the UN Convention, the fighting movement for another world approached ecological organizations.
The French European Ambassador José Bowa, one of the figures of the fight for another world, said he arrived in Copenhagen with a view to "incorporating climate and social justice." "There is the difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The first phenomenon began in Asia and the Pacific, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, some 50,000 people went to the streets according to organizers.
In Manile, several hundred people, mostly students, in red clothing and with plates evolving the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators have come to the streets with a requirement for a major measure against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people attended the protests organized by the "350" movement, especially in Paris, Marseille (they), Lille (sever), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
Separatist Abchazia has chosen her president, Georgia condemns it as a "frash"
Abchazia chose her president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognised this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent in Georgia, Tbilisi, on the contrary, declares this step "frush".
About 131 000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian and Georgian war in August 2008 on control over South Osetia, which is another former Georgian territory recognised by Russia.
Election rooms closed in 17 hours GMT.
According to the officials of the Abkhaz Election Commission, a few hours before the final election rooms were closed 58%.
The first preliminary results should be announced at Saturday night on Sunday.
All five candidates, including the official President Sergei Bagapš, категорically reject the idea of merger with Georgia that condemned these elections.
These choices are frag.
On the other hand, Georgian President Michail Saakashvili "regrets that Abchazia has fallen completely into Russian superiority," his speaker, Manana Manjgaladze, said.
In addition to Russia, the independence of this territory with 216.000 inhabitants only Nikaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally engaged by Russian troops.
After the division from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict, in which several thousand people died, Abchazia is trying to show through the elections that she is ready to return to international policy.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said AFP Kvarčia Svetlanová, 54th-year-old historian who also admitted that she voted for President Bagapsha.
She was one of those who came to the electoral room in school in Suchumi, the beautiful white building with several palms at the entrance.
The question of Russian rule is the main theme of presidential elections in this region on the shore of the Black Sea, which can be proud of a beautiful nature.
All over this small country with 216,000 inhabitants are located in large billboards with Bagapsh next to Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials who have arrived to surveillance the long-term progress of the elections have awaited warm adoption by the district mayor Beslan Arshby.
"We, Abchaz, we are grateful," he said in a small ceremony, having in mind Moscow's support and in particular its decision to recognize Abchazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, said Alexei Islandski, a member of the Russian Parliament, and had a glass vodka for it.
The opposition, which was represented in the elections by the former Vice-President Raul Khazhimba and two traders, Zause Ardzinba and Beslan Boutbo, criticised the contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as a contract that allows Russia to control the rail network of Abchazia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current government or opposition.
The victory in elections requires over half a majority of 50% plus one vote.
If none of the candidates reaches this result, the decisive struggle must take place within two weeks.
Climate: world manifestation, events in Copenhagen
Thousands of thousands of people came to the streets on Saturday with a demand for an important and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be adopted at the Copenhagen Conference, demonstrated throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where the police arrested about 700 people at that occasion.
At least thirty thousand people according to police resources and 10,000 according to organizers showed afternoon in the cold weather in the Danish capital, hosting until 18 December 193 delegates, which are referring to an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the passage peacefully went towards Bella Center, where the negotiations were held.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
For speakers, a stage was built before which a spiritual meeting was held at candles in the participation of the former South African Archbishop of the Cape city Desmond Tut.
According to the AFP journalist, there were incidents shortly after the departure of the passage, when a group of several hundred demonstrators, dressed with cells in black and armed bricks and clays, began to break exhibits.
The order police immediately surrounded them and hit them without waiting, and several manifestants hit the ground.
In general, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and stated that it was especially members of "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical separate groups that had already been shown in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, Eastern France.
Late afternoon, one jacket cop on his jackets was injured and four cars were burned near the squat near the incidents that had resulted in the police's detention sources of about 20 persons.
We focus on extremist groups, warned the speaker's police Henrik Jacobsen, while the helicopters went into the air again.
Most protesters who arrived by bus or train from large German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan were European origin.
But there were many Asians, including several Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue pants, created the first meeting in Copenhagen in the challenge of the Friends of the Earth, which wanted to create "blue waves" for "justice climate".
Today, we go to the streets to require a compensation for the ecological debt for the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine warrior from Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

The French European Ambassador José Bowa, one of the figures of the fight for another world, said he arrived in Copenhagen with a view to "incorporating climate and social justice." "There is the difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Oxfam organized several famous personalities, such as the Danish model Helen Christensen, or the former UN commissioner for refugees, Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first phenomenon began in Asia and the Pacific, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, some 50,000 people went to the streets according to organizers.
In Manile, several hundred people, mostly students in red clothing, showed the councillor of the capital of Philippines, and with patches of evolving solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred demonstrators also met with the requirement of a high-level measure against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people attended the protests organized by the "350" movement, especially in Paris, Marseille (they), Lille (sever), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
The subjects of geographic and history will be strengthened under the reform of the general high school, Chatel declared.
The Minister of Education, Luc Chatel, stated on Sunday during an interview for the JDD magazine that the subjects of history and geographic will be "increased" in the framework of the reform of the general high school, although their training will no longer be required in the last year of the high school with focus on exact science.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week and for everyone the same program from the universal culture, Chatel confirmed.
According to the Minister, "It is necessary to end hypocrisy," because he believes that S is not already focused on exact science," but "the best students are in it."
The EC and L specialization cannot be for some sub-specializations, continues and emphasizes: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would regret not to learn geographic and history in the last year of professional high schools."
The Survey of the Agency of Ifop, which published the Humanite journal on Saturday, showed that seven French of ten (69%) did not agree with the government project to cancel mandatory teachings of history and geographic in the S graduation, and therefore many intellectual and teachers criticised both the left and some Members of the right.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "does not come into consideration" to cancel philosophy in the S specialization programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform in educational education, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for participating in the Tuesday Mobilization against this project, which they believe is sacrificed by the educational education of future high school professors.
In the context of the magistrate study 2 (M2), the Minister explained that at the beginning of the year, a receiving test focused on their fields and at the end of the year to test their ability to teach.
Participants are trained during the second year of the magistrate study, and in the first year they will speak to their students as a teacher.
If you collect all the stairs that you will be offered before the receiving procedure, you will get more experience with students, almost 300 hours , he continued .
The Minister also announced that he would propose "personal right to education", which is not yet in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to cancel the school map by 2012.
In the École elite university, normal supierieures have 15 minutes to convince experts of climate.
Fifteen minutes for the presentation of the Copenhagen Summit objectives: this is the challenge he announced in the summit in the morning, Jean Jouzel, a multi-president of the International Group of Climate Development Experts (GIEC) to initiate Ecole normale supierieure in Ulm Street.
As informed by one AFP journalist, the Nobel Price Laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the Ernest conference, which is some one-day seminar composed of 15-minute expert contributions to be filmed and opened to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people, and on the basis of which they would be more eager to learn more, he explained at the occasion of the 22th conference, Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, who got the name of fish from the local pond, which the students named as this.
Approximately 20 contribution experts from individual scientific disciplines are chosen and indicated that the selection is based on their charisma.
We can talk about climate warming "we can talk hours, but we can also summarize the basic objectives in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke before a fifty of the listeners without preparing notes, only using graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, emphasizing with the hope that the listeners will recognize that "the Code Conference is based on very seriously prepared scientific bases".
Videos recorded on these lectures will be placed on web schools since 15 December.
The next Ernest seminar is planned for February and the following will follow with regularity every two months.
Payment delays: angered overseers in prisons, planned measures
The prison overseers' committees announced on Friday “the general mobilization” because they demand that they receive premiums and overtimes whose refund was postponed on January for financial reasons.
Inmate FO (2th Unions of Overseers) requested employees who would not have the service to attend demonstrations held on Tuesday morning before prison facilities and to "block" them and thus warn them of "thefting of their rewards".
CGT for prison overseers (3. Unions of this sector) called on them to "convene meetings in individual prisons and start a substantial mobilization" with the "shame and unacceptable" that "times and supplements for work in the night, on Sundays and holidays" worked in October are not retained in December.
The first Union of Overseers, the Federal Union of Prisoner Overseers (Ufap/Unsa), "requests for total mobilization... to demonstrate dissatisfaction and agitation".
The Directorate-General and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtimes has increased much in 2009 and not all were included in the financial budget, but assured that the debt amounts will be repaid in January.
The Office stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari sent to the prison overseers' committees of the communication in which they were assured that the payment will be carried out next month.
I know about the efforts that the prison staff is making to ensure the functioning and modernization of our prison system, the minister writes in his communication.
I have ordered the administration of prisons to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation that occurred by the wrong assessment of overtime is never repeated in the future, the Minister Alliot-Mari added.
The December pay will therefore be low, except for governing employees who receive a famous premium for performing the function and fulfilling the goals, states Ufap/Unsa, and for those "will always be placed in the budget".
It's just a scandal, the interregional union of FO in Marseille, and it announced its decision to boycott to the appeal of "all meetings and calls".
The employees will not come to work on Sunday or on holidays, unless their supplements for these October days are paid in December, as well as overtime, FO Rhane-Alpes-Auvergne is also threatened.
At the time they give us more work and more jobs without giving us additional staff, it is sad to allow those lowest employees to pay for it, states CGT prison guards in Bordeaux.
According to unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better than others.
However, in any case, financial resources because little, the Secretary-General Ufap, Jean-François Forget, established.
Obama claims she gives "better gifts" on Christmas than those that she gets.
The American President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, conferred on "the goddess" of Oprah Winfrey's screen that he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than those that I receive."
President and his wife Michelle talked in a special edition of a show that will be transmitted on Sunday night at the ABC station about how to spend Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, a small four-foot family colleague gets his part.
Jesusek also likes Boa, Michelle Obam said that the dog also "of course" gets a gift, as it comes from the passages from the preliminary show.
And Michelle Obama also restrained her husband's claim on the subject of the quality of the gifts she gets, "Surely not, I gave you a great gift last year," she scattered the president.
Well, of course it's true, he was forced to agree with the president, but right after that, he showed his finger on the pearl necklace of the first lady, "And who gave you this?"
In this single very relaxed show, the famous moderator, who strongly supported Baracka Obama in his presidential campaign, also spoke to Obama's husbands about their most favorite gifts that they received as children.
Barack Obama indicated a bike with ten degrees of transmission, but also a basketball ball that dedicated him on Christmas to his Kenyan father, with whom he was only very rarely.
I remember seeing my father who came to look at us for Christmas and how he gave me that basketball ball, the president told me.
A long time later, I realized that the ball actually gave me.
The first lady remembered the doll house again.
I didn't know how to organize all this in the house, so I balanced all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the chamber, but I loved that little doll house, remembering Michelle Obam.
Johnny Hallyday surged again, RTL states he's in an artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was reoperated in Los Angeles because of the "injury" caused after the bigger operation he performed in France, but the situation is according to his nearest "controlled", while the RTL station stated that the singer is in an artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated from Wednesday to Thursday in Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors established "injury coming from the operation" of the brushed plotches that he performed in Paris on 26 November, reported in Paris his press office, with these leagues required "regular operation".
However, the press department tried to calm the public and stated that the situation was "controlled" and also announced that new medical communications would be issued by 48 hours at the latest.
According to the RTL station, which is the main partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was placed in the artificial sleep to prevent "sickness and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we'll be a little more sure, RTL delivers.
The press office, on the AFP question, did not confirm or confirm this information.
The RTL also states that, according to "some sources", no drone was placed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was surged to the International Clinic Parc Monceau for a scratched platene.
The operation scheduled for a few days earlier has been performed by the neurosurgeon Stephan Delejoux, a well-known physician in art circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to speak to the RTL information.
After this surgery, Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized in Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles for the infection that happened after the intervention.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallydaye, said on Thursday in the RTL radio that his friend is just passing "wrong time", but he added that rocker "no worry," because it's a big "fighter".
He called me just before he left in Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing stupid because spending 12 hours in a plane after that surgery wasn't funny, Eddie Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the site of the singer producer Jean-Claude Camus, who stated that Johnny Hallyday "reaged well on antibiotics" and that the infection was "stoped".
Mr. Camus also said that he met Laeticia, the wife of a singer, and that he did not notice any special concerns.

Two months later, to surprise everyone, it was discovered that Johnny Hallyday was operated on "little tumor of thin womb" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his salutes.
But since then, each of his health problems has been very monitored and commented. The fans and journalists noticed that the singer has difficulties with the movement at the stage.
In mid November, his team had to dement the new hospitalization report again.
Euro-2009/ small pool: Prime Minister Bousqueta in his favorite discipline
French Frédérick Bousquet, a three-fold medailist at the world's championship in 2009 in a large swimming pool, received a title on Thursday at the European Championship 2009 in a small pool in Istanbul in the discipline, which he especially likes: 50m free way.
The first day of the championship that last allowed suits, only three world records fell, although they were expected much more.
One of them overcome the Hungarian Race Evelyn Verrasht at 200 m position race and two remaining men's chafet Russia on 4x50 m position race.
A great grief for Bousquet, who has made the world record in a 50m free way that already holds in a large pool (20,94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, 50m free way, 28-year-old French won with the final time 20,53 seconds in the final, where the prime minister launched ten swimmers instead of the ordinary eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatia Dje Draganja (20,70) and Russian Sergei Fesikov (20,84), but he failed to overcome the world record (20.30), as he assumed.
We can always dream about something better, but I said, if the world record is in my reach, I'll try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all the swimmers had on them combines made from polyuretan that would be prohibited from 1 January.
Combineses helped from February 2008 to 238 world records and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first host in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the suit this time did not help the Germans Paul Biederman, a double world master in a large swimming swimming pool in Rome, who had a world record at the reach of his hand.
The young swimmer failed to overcome the record that holds 400 meters free way (3:32.77), but yet he won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian race Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything in that race.
I knew I couldn't overcome the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and fulfill my task.
Lobintsev will be a serious competitor to the future, explained Biedermann.
U.S.: the Romanian sarkofage board belonging to Zola has been educated for 1.5 million USD
The Romanian sarkofage board, which belonged to no one other than the French writer Emil Zola, was educated on Thursday for $1.5 million of US dollars, which is significantly more than it was estimated, said the Sotheby's art trader.
The price of this two meters long and 63 cm high foreboard, from the third century of our year, was estimated to $150,000 to $250,000.
Mramor "representing four dionisov scenes in architectural decore, surrounded satyre and bakchants is a rare part, similar pieces are very few, perhaps four or five," AFP reported on Tuesday, Florent Heintz, Vice-President auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art in Sotheby’s.
The work was sold among hundreds of others.
The sale is still in progress, but it is the subject to which the AFP spokesman Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy, was told to the AFP.
The fact that Emile Zola bought this marble was found a few days ago.
The board was nearly 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borgia family, and then gradually appeared at the French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated the van with her in her private hotel in Paris and at Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic in France, and shortly the President of the Council before the accession of Marshal Petain.
She's been shaded there for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz discovered in the search of the Museum database in Louvr that this board was part of the "remnants of Emila Zoly" opened since 1903, a year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the fresky "Rougon-Macquart".
Interrupted attempt to leave President Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico decided on Thursday that no conditions were met for the transport of the President of Honduras, Manuel Zelayi, whom rebels refused to guarantee a safe departure.
After a telephone conversation that I had with President Zelaya last night, everything now suggests that there is no way to implement this transport, the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosová, said.
The Mexican government plane, which arrived in Salvador on Wednesday, flew back to President Zelaya, stated the source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The government of the pumps wanted to force President Zelay to "demision" and to ask for political asylum in abroad, only so it would give him a chance of safe departure.
But the dismissed president refused these requirements because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exile head of the state.
The government of pure "featured another failure when she wanted me to give up my functions... they wanted me to demiss," said Zelaya Radio Globo on Thursday, which often expresses the political crisis that lasts for five months in this Mediterranean country.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, adding a dismissed president, hid on the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a few ifrds.
The embassy of Mexico asked us to provide a safe transport guarantee, but unfortunately we can't accept it because it does not contain a asylum request, said in the middle the Minister of Publishing Government Oscar Raul Matute to the Honduras Radio HRN.
I will not ask for asylum to any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview for the Telesur station in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, and I leave as the president of the Honduras people, he emphasized.
The news of Zelaya's departure was mobilized in the middle of the embassy of the President who came to gather around the embassy of Brazil, where the army strengthened protection.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticised the position of the purity government.
They show their marginal attitude to international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who approached the Socialist Venezuela President Hugo Chavez, was removed on 28 June on the day he organized in preparation for his re-elected public consultation against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
From the exile in Costa Rica he suddenly returned on September 21st and found refuge in the Brazilian Embassy.
If he gets out of here, he will be arrested and responsible for the crime of the "velesrade", which he is accused of, the purple government claims.
Publish President Roberto Micheletti was able to organize presidential elections on November 29th to replace President Zelaya.
In controversial elections recognised by the United States but condemned by Latin America as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo.
Three days later, Congress voted against the return of President Zelaya to power until the end of his 27 January mandate.

Cuba : hundreds of advocates of the regime printed "Ladies in white"
Several hundred members of the Cuban regime have released the women of political prisoners meeting in Hawana on the occasion of the World Human Rights Day and prevented further manifestations for which dozens of disidents were arrested.
About 40 "Ladies in white", wives or close political prisoners were printed directly on the street by Raula Castra regime at their walk towards the center of the capital, with a request for release of political prisoners, informed the journalist.
Go away with Yankees!, "Golders!" "The street belongs to the revolutionary!", "Let's live Fidel and Raul!" were scandalled by the raised fists of the dissident regime.
Disidents were eventually escorted by civilians who arrived to "secure security".
A day earlier, there was a similar manifestation in Hawana against "Ladies in White", but there was no injury or arrest.
But in the Havaan quarter, Vedado was detained by some ten disidents who were also going to show on Thursday on the occasion of the World Day of Human Rights, informed AFP journalist.
According to this journalist, the police have imposed disidents who have been printed by government supporters in civil vehicles using force.
The arrest of disidents in similar conditions lasts only a few hours.
The European Parliament's owners of the Sahar Prize for 2005, "Ladies in White" organized an unauthorized march for "release all, according to the disent, about 200 political prisoners", said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is resigning 20 years in prison.
Mr. Maceda is one of 75 Cuban disidents arrested in March 2003, 53 remaining behind the nets.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents as "free" or "agents" paid by their main enemy, the United States.
A complete miracle, the Cuban television has brought a report on the fourth manifestation of the advocates of the government regime against the opponents of the Revolution.
Cuba with the Communist Party headed and the government policy of one party is regularly accused by European or American non-governmental organizations of non-compliance with human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A mad man killed an eighty-year-old man and wounded five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A mad man armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old man and wounded another five people in Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at the time of the summit on Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary results of the investigation, an attacker at the age of 28 reportedly attacked with two knives and for unknown reasons an eighty-year-old man in the pharmacy or before it, on 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, this is the version of the police and witnesses.
Hardly wounded old master, born in 1929, died by the Alliance police union in the hospital for the consequences of injuries.
In this pharmacy or in front of her, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
A husband, aged about 30 years, began to defend himself and was hurt.
The first two seriously wounded victims were adopted to the same hospital where an 80 - year - old man died.
The life of the second wounded is in danger, according to police resources, apparently vital authorities have been affected.
The pregnant woman then crashed and was transported to the hospital "in shock," said the police source.
A armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as he stated by a police source, then fled to the street, still on the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He hurt two more people, apparently accidentally: a 30-year-old and 40-year-old man, the other man seriously.
As it all happened, it's not quite clear, because it all happened in the evening hours.
He was armed with two meat knives he was carrying the cross behind his back, said at the position of the head of the Alliance union in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several circuits, including young people, have tried to stop and disarma the mad man according to the testimony of the AFP.
I saw some 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commenting on Alberto's situation, a bar waiter.
He was a mob, including a city cop who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at level 61, two city police officers, including their commander, tried to arrest an armed man and were injured with their hands, said the police source.
There was an incident in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
The colleagues came to tell me there's a wounded person out there.
I walked out and saw a seventy-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and I noticed big wounds on my stomach, I told AFP Frederic Allione, a 30-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, another approximately 30 - year - old person who also had a knife wound.
A man who didn't have his IDs arrested the police.
The State Representative in Nanterre has transferred the case to the District Police Department in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspect attacker was transferred to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody and's waiting for an interrogation.
The police source did not exclude his location in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source stated that six police officers needed him to handle the police station in Clichy where he was transported.
He was "a lot out of himself" like "all the mads of this type whose power is ten times increased in action."
U.S.: Polansky's lawyer again requests the termination of the criminal prosecution
The lawyer of the Polish-France director Romana Polanski asked again on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States) to stop a criminal prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence because of the moral affair that happened 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a legal representative of the Pianist film director, criticised the three judges of the second district appeal court in California of serious mistakes, which occurred during the receipt of the event in 1977.
I demand a stop of the prosecution now and now, stated attorney Hummel, and added that in the conduct of the judge who made a decision then, Laurence Rittenbanda "had freezing in his back."
According to him, the judge (which died in the meantime) had reportedly to be treated with a state representative who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to jail – which is a serious offence against the law.
The information on this conversation appeared in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, requested and requested), from the mouth of David Wells.
But Mr. Wells eventually declared at the end of September that he lied to the author of the document.
In case the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, the lawyer Hummel will require the proceedings to be conducted to submit evidence of his claims.
The plaintiff repeated what was already said in the first state, that there will not be any serious study of the request for the cessation of a criminal prosecution until Roman Polanski is brought before court.
76-year-old director escaped from the United States in 1978, before the court sentenced in the matter of "Illegal Sexual Relationship" with a minor girl aged 13 years.
Since then, he has never entered the territory of the United States again.
The prosecutor's deputy at Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said that Roman Polanski "she should be there to participate in the courtroom."
We want to tell not only Romana Polaska but also other defendants that it is possible to escape? Mrs Asayam asks.
It is the opinion that the director "seeks a court service and contempts his authority."
One of the three judges, now having 90 days to make a decision, also stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape."
Hummel's lawyer wasn't the one who asked to stop Roman Polanski's criminal prosecution.
The legal representative of the victim, Samantha Geimer, also asked again for the end of the criminal prosecution.
She recalled that her client would no longer endure the eternal disturbance every time the case of Polanski comes up and adds: "No one in this room can say that the process was fair."
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on U.S. command
After more than two months behind the nets, he was released to a home prison in his chamber in Gstaad, where he was waiting for any proof.
Wall Street ends without direction, he's stopping up a dollar
The New York Bureau ended on Friday without direction, the market is wiped between the indicators that are better than the US expected and the increase price of the dollar: Dow Jones won +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final conclusion, Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points and Nasdaq, with technological domination, left 0.55 points and ended at 2.190.31 points.
Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of the trade is very low, and I think it's going to stay until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected, and which "have helped improve the mood on the market as regards the stability of economic recovery," analyst Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail markets have increased by 1.3% in November, and it has been the second month after it and much more than it was expected.
According to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index, the confidence of American consumers has also returned and has increased strongly to 73.4 to 67.4 in December in the previous month.
The indexes, however, have been inhibited by a new increase in the dollar price against the euro, which is highest in the last two months, which "built down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank.
Technological stocks are losing the ground under their feet.
The sale of securities has fallen down.
State treasures with a 10-year view increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday night and with a 30-year view, to 4.497% compared to 4.492% earlier.
Miss World's choice back in the South African Republic.
After the monthly journey across the South African Republic, 112 candidates for Miss World title on Saturday will cross the target to achieve their dream: to be elected by the most beautiful woman in the world before a billion television players.
This great celebration of beauty has been held in Johannesburg for the second year, and so far five candidates have obtained a semifinal process.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasakiová, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Maria Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Maová from Canada were elected Miss sport or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a true faith of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape City.
I've seen a lot of things and I have so many experiences!
The competition in the South African Republic will be transmitted in direct transfer from Midrand, northern Johannesburg, from 17 p.m. (15 hours of world time).
I couldn't dream about a beautiful country in which I put my crown.
It was fascinating experience.
I'm happy that I could have experienced it twice, Miss of the world of Ksenia Sukhin, in the hot south summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in the South African Republic was in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and the new discovery of the country and its "real lands".
After a month of performances, tests, press meetings and safari now focuses on the competition itself.
India Pooja Chopra hopes to go in the steps of Priyanka Chopra, selected in 2000, which also participated in the elections of Aishwarye Rai, the winners of 1994, which both became Bollywood's stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is a dream of every woman, but it's not just a look.
We are the ambassador of our countries and I want to go home with a crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to organizers, the 59th year old will be carried in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates will be presented in traditional suits and, of course, in swimming.
The presentation will be presented by the Chinese TV moderator Angela Chow, the former Queen of the Beauty of the South African Republic of Michelle McLean and the Chairman of the Miss World Committee Steve Douglas.
The South African Republic has shown that she can welcome the world with heat that it is difficult to deal with, said Julia Morley, President of Miss World Competition.
Like last year, candidates attended safari, visited a famous town of Soweto, this time on the bike, and tasted local kitchen.
An extraordinary event was the meeting with the South African President Jacob Zum, who shakes their hand.
The president's unusual, Miss Sierry Leone noted.
Undoubtedly, the most beautiful memories will remain in the Cape City (southwest of the country) for the World Cup that will take place in June 2010 and which has helped the country to support something more.
I could have met people I didn't even dream of.
I will certainly return to the 2010 World Cup, with the enthusiasm of Miss Italy Alice Taticchi.
According to David's son, reports of Hallyday's state are "very positive".
The reports of Johnny Hallyday's state are "very positive", as his son David assured us at his Friday arrival in Los Angeles, where he arrived to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong and everything goes very well, David Hallyday declared when he arrived from Paris a moment after the 13th hour of local time (21st World Time)
The singer's son, who acted quietly, declared that "as soon as possible" would get to the Los Angeles Hospital Cedars-Sinaë, which Johny Hallyday was adopted on Monday due to postoperative infection arising after the surgery of an immune inter-reverse plot, which was approached on 26 November in Paris.
According to the press statement, the night was singing in Los Angeles because of the comfort of "related into artificial sleep", which would prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was already incorporated to the hospital Cedars-Sinaé in Los Angeles. The hospitalization was infected after the surgery of the rigged intervertible plotches performed on 26 November in Paris.
Because of serious damage caused by this intrusion , a singer must have been reoperated from Wednesday to Thursday .
According to the photographer AFP, his wife Laetia attended the school show of the French Lycea in Los Angeles, visiting their daughter Jade on Friday morning.
The privilege of the ortopedic surgery and traumatology of the hospital la Pitié-Salpetrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he leaves for a singer to Los Angeles on Monday.
The manufacturer strongly accused Dr. Stephana Deliouxe, a neurosurgeon who operated on Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on November 26th.
They told us it was a massacre.
The surgeons from Los Angeles declared they were upset, M. Camus said.
I heard about the possibility of the future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes Johnny Hallyday's gone too fast to Los Angeles with his Paris surgeon's permission."
I personally spoke to the doctor, and he assured me that this trip was not a problem, which surprised me so much, since I had already had two times suffered from an interreversal platelet, he added.
A moment earlier, at the RTL radio station, he said that the singer must have flew after the Paris surgery without a drone, without anything."
Dr. Stephane Delioux is very famous in art circles.
He operated the actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic, which he was working on at that time.
In 2007, he also operated the actress Charlotte Gainsburg in removal of a hematom resulting from bleeding into the brain.
It is also a doctor with a dark reputation, sentenced several times in cases of neglecting medical care, for tax escapes and fraud.
A doctor's attorney Olivier Metzner called him "the man without scrupule", which is "regularly" called before the medical chamber, and which cannot be "recommended far away".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stephane Delejoux expressed himself on Friday to the matter through his lawyer David Kubbi.
He announced that the operation had "perfectly good progress" and the post-operation examination was "normal".
Operation was not a haemorrhagic nature, therefore the introduction of the drene was not necessary," he added.
The health problems of the singer has grown since this summer and, in any case, it seems to remain with the questionnaire.
It is obvious that the term of renewal of the planned tour on 8 January (Amiens, Post Red.) appears too close, Camus declared.
The UDF association increases the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre to continue to use their shortcuts.
The UDF, controlled by the Party of MoDemFrançoise Bayrou, responded on Friday to an attempt by the President of the Nouveau Centre, Herv Morin to accommodate a briefly the former Giscard Party with the abbreviation of any media under the threat of a criminal prosecution.
Herve Morin publicly announced his intention to own a short UDF with the fact that François Bayrou does not deserve to bear her legacy after he handed his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of Nouveau Centre (NC).
This step has received support from Hervego de Charetta (ex-UMP now for NC), who assigns the ownership of the UDF mark, because he first registered it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institution national de la propriet industry).
But on Friday night, the UDF Association of Managing Friends of Françoise Bayrou, who do not intend to be expelled, left their silence and filed a formal request to the Minister and the Members to stop using a short and render the property of the security mark under the threat of a criminal prosecution.
In the last days, you have raised an alarming statement that you will propose your political movement + new to take up+ short UDF, the Association of 19 of the 24 members of the Committee, such as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, or Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance Center.
At the same time, you considered it suitable to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement name+Nouveau center+, with a slog +UDF todayška+, also set up signators of the letter.
As you know, you do not have the right to use this shortcut, explains the UDF committee that requests the NC's movement immediately to remove all the names of UDF from all promotional materials, including (all) web sites."
At the same time, he asks Herv de Charette to "train the property of the protective mark to legitimate owners".
If you do not, we will turn to the courts to respect the law and legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories are alerting.
In their letter, they state that UDF "is a full political movement in 1978 " and reminds Mr Morin and his friends "selected" leave in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as well as others in 2002 to establish UMP.
The Nouveau Centre therefore does not, according to them, have no right to use the UDF shortcut (Union pour la democratia française).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF convention voted in 2007 to join the MOD for three years and to protect the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valeri Giscard d'Estaing.
With regard to Hervego de Charette, the committee continues, "if it registered the security mark", not "for three years of membership," but UMP.
In a scandal and fraud, he used non-existent registration of acronyms to make it on his own account.
This irregularity begins to be converted into a criminal act, they declare, and then, with irony, they express to the NC strategy: "We seem that both in politics and normal life, it is more valuable to create a name for ourselves than to come out of anonymity by a deception of a name that we do not have the right."
The case of Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness.
On Friday, the Tribunal in Nanterre decided to judge Françoise-Marie Baniera and judge whether he used the weakness of an 80-year-old billionaire to lose her part of her fortune, which blames her daughter Liliane Bettencourt.
Photograph (62 years) known by its photographs of famous will be judged by 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, which is a criminal act for which the penalty is stored for a maximum of 3 years and a penalty of 375 000 euros.
This decision confirms that the process in the case is really to be identified as a family stag of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are attacked and fighting for the management of the L'Oréal cosmetic empire.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be conducted by the three doctors' colleague.
The inheritance and chief shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to take such investigations, certainly not under the conditions offered by the State Representative in Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors chosen on Friday should develop a report by 10 March 2010, while expressing whether Liliana Bettencourt could be in the state of weakness and in which period.
I think he'll get him.
I'm going to talk to her, he said after the hearing of Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyers, Georges Kieman.
As for Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
It's a great report(...). Expertize will show that with this old lady who needs protection, he manipulated (M. Banier), he confirmed.
There are two years that the only daughter of Liliana Bettencourt launched a criminal proceeding against François-Marie Banier, the photographer and the artist whom he blames for years that he used the state of his mother's weakness to gain a billion euros form of checks, contracts for life insurance or images of masters.
So Liliane Bettencourt always refused to be a photographer who she considers a long-term friend to be manipulated.
While the court had to judge the jurisdiction of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers' lawsuit, the Friday court speech of lawyers changed at the family hour of truth.
The attorney of Liliana Bettencourt presented three letters (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notebook, in which she expressed her untrustedness to the husband of Françoisa Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt, according to a lawyer, delivers, : "you could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for 15 years once or twice a day.
Since she was married, I could never talk to Françoise."
The state representation in Nanterre reiterated that the complainant's proceedings were not eligible, more that the custody judge in these days rejected her application for the initiation of a procedure to issue legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully capable of participating in the court, is not under protection or in custody.
No one else will act for her," said the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The Court finally decided that Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers will be expressed at the time of the process.
Managing revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for economic intelligence development was useless...
For more than ten years, it reminds the conduct of the management of large companies against employees of the company's access to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is to identify collaborators with "values" designated from the mountains, as it was earlier when consumers needed to force products that came from the ideas of factory techniques.
By becoming the customer's centre of business companies, the marketing revolution of the marketing strategy in the right direction... even if the authoritary attempts to force products different from customers' preferences are regularly returning!
Passive access to employees can lead to death demoralization.
Suicide in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only a visible part of a much wider general phenomenon that mainly affects the managerial cable.
This demobilization affects the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including research and development, and, more important, economic intelligence.
And indeed, EI "requires all parties involved... active access and ability to predict" and requires from employees commitments that are completely in contrast with the revenues of the authority management.
We therefore call for the manager's revolution that should be aimed at bringing employees into the business center as well as the client.
Relative usefulness of internal public opinion studies.
Internal public opinion surveys - as a questionnaire submitted to employees of Orange - will contribute to the revolution in managerial procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mostly because I've already convinced myself that the structure in the face of the new situation will be returned to... what she always did!
Furthermore, because authorization, as one of the pathologies of power, increases moderately with the severity of its own failures.
And finally, because most of the governing employees have a simplified view of human behavior.
Since graduates are high schools for engineers, they have mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For reason of the convenience of mind, they are conquering an old behavioristic theory, now renewed by "neuved" from the United States, and widely spread without greater knowledge of the scientific constitution and the media.
With the possibility of moving "packs" (sic) the involvement of managers, the recent Ipsos survey on Figaro.fr pages showed that only strengthens managing employees in their position of mechanical management that is inappropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure the factors of mobilization.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises is expected to adopt the final vision of human behaviour.
It is incorporating basic attention to all intentions and practices of management : For employees, commitments to the undertaking will be possible only if they appear as a clear means to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects.
This concept of the motivation of employees is currently addressed only by studies Thematically Functional Analysis.
These studies showed that they evaluate their undertakings on the basis of the pre-defined dox that would enable them to assess what it offers to meet their objectives.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, managers can control, predict and anticipate on their "social performance" and place their management of human resources "in the right way".
This creates a live soil for the development of solid and effective economic intelligence.
With the expression of Oslo: "the righteous war" Obama was praised by the right hand.
The American right welcomed on Friday the speech Barack Obama presented a day before in Oslo, satisfied with the concept of "just war" against the enemy of the United States.
The Conservatives who first laughed at the price of Obama on October 9th, this time the presidential speech was flattered, including Sarah Palin, former vice presidential candidates in the elections in 2008.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the museum of the right republic wing, for the USA Today journal, and added that she had expressed itself to this theme "every time necessary" of war in her memorys that are now coming.
Of course, war is the last thing the Americans would like to have to do, but it's necessary.
All terrorists need to be held there, he thinks.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his precedents, George W. Bush, on Thursday in Oslo justified the sending of forces and used the speech to explain his decision to send another 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days ago.
Another Obam's opponent, Newt Gingrich, estimated the president was doing a very good job in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, congratulations from the former President of the House of Representatives, who appreciated the president's main reference to the "existence of evil in the world".
In my own way, I thought this speech was completely historical, Gingrich declared during the interview in the "The Takeaway" radio.
Former Member, whom some consider as a possible Republican candidate in the presidential elections for 2012, was excited to see the " left president" to remind members of the Nobel Price Committee that they would not be free and could not hand over the price of peace if the use of forces were not there."
According to Michael Gerson, the former author of the speech George W. Bush, now the editor of Washington Post, Obama presented "very American speech".
Not only did he represent himself as "the world inhabitants" as always, but "he spoke as an American president" and reminded the Europeans that they live in a safe bubble they didn't create themselves and that they did not do too much to save it," Gerson estimated.
Among a few displeasants from the series of right belongs the jarbus of Bush's era, the former Ambassador at the UN John Bolton, who referred to as " uniform, incredible and inspired", as he stated on the National Review Online website .
On the left of the president, for example, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is frightened by viewing Baracka Obama, as he justifies the use of forces.
"When we put the war into the package of justice, we can easily reason the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the medium-left press stands against the president's commendable opinion.
Although Los Angeles Times continues to consider the price of peace to Obama as early, he considered his output "superfinance" even for a speaker famous with his talent.
The manifestation of Oslo should serve as an instruction for international decisions to address conflicts, in the fight against poverty and oppression," the California journal notes enthusiasticly.
Obama "pronounced the speech he needed," estimated in New York Times, and marked the expression "a simple and lessonable."
Road carriers: three maratones to a deal that saves the delivery of supplies for Christmas.
After three marathons, the road carriers and TLF communities, the only employee organisation that remained until the end, on Friday night, to an agreement that terminated the call for an strike and a threat hanging over the supplier of Christmas supplies.
The Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, during the Friday signing of the agreement, expressed "happiness" after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night, the negotiators broke up on Friday morning with hope that the text of the agreement will be signed as soon as possible at the end of the morning.
Even though three employees organisations (FNTR, Unosra, OTRE) have withdrawn from the negotiations.
But there was a need for more than six hours of a meeting that started at 11:00.
This conflict "will hurt businesses very much" and "threatened to disturb holidays at the end of the year", Bussereau said.
The text contains a 4% increase in remuneration for lowest salaries (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
The hourly pay is increased from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we'll give our members a order not to block blocks, no blockage of supplies.
But there may be several other opponents who are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, welcomed the "proper agreement", even though it was difficult to acknowledge the increase in high salaries in relation to international competition ".
According to him, increases by 170 euros per month in the lowest responsibilities and 100 to 120 euros in the highest.
It is a healthy understanding and respect for employees, said CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), it is "admissible compromise".
The Agreement also envisages the revaluation of travel expenditure of 3% and a report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow focusing on the question of 13 payments and modernisation of the collective contract.
Bussereau recalled "declined by 100 million euros on taxes from the remuneration of businesses" which was the subject of the Government's amendment proposal for the 2009 draft budget law, which was voted on Thursday to Friday of the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate for "proper" vote.
The signature allows this Agreement to apply first to undertakings which are members of this organisation, later to the whole sector, in case of extension by the Ministry of Labour.
It will be "in the shortest term," Bussereau assured.
The whole process can only disagree with employers' organisations.
The FNTR speaks of "wrong trade" because 100 million euros "but offered to the sector under the compensation of part of carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to do emergency negotiations not as a result of mutual analysis, but in order to make sure that he does not wrath the crochets at the coming Christmas holidays, Unoster complained.
For the organization of Otre, the agreement is threatened in the next 12 months "to bury a large quantity of small and medium-sized businesses in the field".
RER A: interruption of the weekend transport, commissions are not satisfied with the proposals of the RATP transport undertaking.
The interruption of the transport line of RER A, which is the largest line of urban bunch transport in France, will continue during the weekend, as the Friday talks between the sites and the RATP leadership did not lead to any specific results in the issue of the premium.
Saturday and Sunday, so the days of an important buying weekend before Christmas, trains will only ride between 10 and 20 hours, on the main section (mean La Defence and Nation) will ride every other train, outside this section only one train from four.
The SNCF connection will be interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture and travellers will be forced to move on another train.
Trade houses Galleries Lafayette, which expect more than 200 000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that RATP was trying to ensure connection with large business houses.
RER A line leads from the west to the east of Paris aglomeration.
The RATP controlled section leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, there was one of two trains operating in the highway, and practically no boarding was driving outside the time as planned.
Like Thursday, the people of Ile de France settled differently, and there was no confusion at the stages.
So early in the morning, the Station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less people than usual, including because the students and students were missing.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he rose up about an "hour and a half early to make sure he's arriving in time."
The Station of Saint-Lazare has not been filled, the SNCF state railway announced, as more establishments and order guards were predicted.
The suburb trains RER A operated by SNCF in the direction of or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left Station Saint-Lazare with a metro connector.
Further striking meetings will be held on Saturday and Sunday, where the results of the Friday afternoon meeting will be evaluated by the committees as "slab".
The RER leadership proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER trains and on all pages, adjustment of working hours, career progress, etc.
However, this is not about drivers who demand the deserved bonus, according to Thierry Garon (CouncilsJih).
RATP has even postponed proposals on the premium so far, which made CGT worse with the leadership "not able to solve the problem, while it was done with travelers and SNCF".
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, the RATP transport companies “review the conditions of the performance of the job” set out.
Which is why experts think that the company is making fun of the weekend travelers.
In the morning, about 150 drivers were employed by the business committee in its Parisian residence.
The leadership that has denied any debate during the strike has therefore decided to meet in the interests of "settlement".
It is threatened that the conflict will be extended on Tuesday to the RER B line, after Unsa and Nedependence announce the strike emergency.
The Committees require a premium of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros of variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (Jih), Independents (Independents)) and difficulty at the worsening working conditions on this line, which will transport a million passengers daily.
The Prigrad train drivers RER earned a career of 2200 to 2700 euros of gross remuneration and 600 to 650 euros of premiums for an unregular working period and for work on Sunday and on holidays.
The Turkish justice has set up for the Kurdish side, and this decision brings difficult consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court decided on Friday to abolish the main pro-kurd parties in the country. This decision immediately called for protests in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision may significantly complicate the task of the government, which is trying to give the Kurdian community a friendly hand and thus try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for Democratic Society (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become "the nest of activities threatening the independence of the State and its inseparable unity," the Chairperson of the Supreme Court Hasim Kilic told the journalists after four days of the negotiations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, when most or seven votes were needed to dissolve the party, said Kiliç and added that 37 side cads, including her President Ahmet Türk and Ambassador Aysela Tugluk, were prohibited from taking part in political life for five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity taken by Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation of the property of the party to the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP Party has 21 chairs in Parliament (of 500).
The leading party has already warned before the verdict that the Members would rather leave Parliament than act as Members without political properity.
The decision is the continuation of the process launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Casation Court, Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obedience to the "commands" of the Worker Party of Kurdistan (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider as a terrorist organization.
Many observers are convinced that DTP is a legal political vitre of rebels from the PKK.
The country assures that there is no "basic connection" with the PKK, but refuses to designate it as a terrorist organization and invites the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's judgment comes at the time the government offers a friendly hand to the Kurdian community and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and attempts to limit the support of the Kurds against the PKK and to end the conflict.
The DTP leaders confirmed that the dissolving of the party could lead to renewing the tension in the southeast of Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions under which the leader of PKK Abdullah Öcalan has been detained to conflict with the police during the past weeks.
Since the notification of the decision of justice, thousands of demonstrators have gathered before the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast, mostly the Kurds.
The police used tears and water guns, demonstrators were throwing Molot's cocktails again, or shooting stones from the barrels.
In Istanbul, there were also about a hundred people.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk said that the decision of justice only "increased desperation".
Turkey cannot solve this question (Curds, Rec.) by the prohibition of the party, he declared in the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamic Movement, also condemned this decision.
We are from the principle against the interruption of the parties.
It's nothing, Mr. Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a complete shoot of democratic proposals launched by the government, commented politician Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can wait for the PKK response, he added.
On Thursday, PKK joined one of the most murdered attacks in northern Turkey, who killed three days ago seven soldiers.
Snow can come
That's what Wolfgang Brauburger wishes.
Not because he'd like to push citizens, says the head of the winter department of the FESs Technical Services.
But so that his employees can try and learn to control all the vehicle techniques.
It could be the first time that meteorologists say it would happen this weekend.
More than 300 employees and 120 vehicles are prepared to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is working according to the precise plan.
Once it snows in Frankfurt, and the temperatures fall under zero, they go to 20 so-called sections and large-speakers, Brauburger explains.
Among these sections are main and passages such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, lines of pregrading public transport, walking zones and segments with declines like Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at 3:00 a.m.
If necessary, it is necessary to sulp with wet salt that holds better about 1040 miles in the maximum of three hours.
That's why the FES starts at 3:00 a.m. "to make the road free when transport starts to work."
It's hard to start snowing at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the chief of the winter Technical Services, "because no one is willing to make a place for the sypkers."
Only when they don't snow so much, there are arrival and connecting communications, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority has side and sideways.
Brauburger knows they'll complain there.
Five o'clock in the morning, the FESs pedestrians will go to the trip, rather cleaning dangerous places and transitions.
FES cannot usually take care of all cyclostes.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which follows from 22 to 4.30 mostly bridges, says Brauburger.
As a fast ice cream is made, the syringes go immediately as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
If necessary, the police will also call them.
Dinosaur colleague
Tawa Hallae looked like a lot of other mass-free dinosaurs: a animal long two meters and 1,50 meters high running at two strong back ends, had a long skull with sharp, tight teeth, short front lips with screws and a long tail.
If this kind lived a few million years later, it would be nothing extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt from University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the quarter edition of the Science magazine writes that Tawa Hallae was but one of the first dinosaurs with these physical signs.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then in the equitable dry area of the Pangea supercontinent.
Tawa opens a new window to the former evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He's showing us a lot about relative relations, expansions and signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006 Nesbitt and other paleontologists in Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico began.
Sometimes in one day we found a dozen dinosaur bones, which is unseen for accommodation from trias, informs a member of Randall Irmis from the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones have identified scientists quickly as a new species.
During the digging, the remains of five individuals were collected.
The finding confirms theory of the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sunny god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual finding: "The fossils of the dinosaurs of the trias are very rare, mostly only individual fractions are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without an exception.
Especially sensative this finding is not, but it confirms some theories of the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the university in Bonno.
According to the current scientific opinion, the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of pradinosaurs is mostly disputed.
Experts discuss, for example, when the squirrels divided into three of the most important development lines: massojad terropods, which later belonged to Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor, and also birds, "long-night" sauropods and their relatives, and biologists of Ornithishchia (birds), including Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa Hallae is after Nesbitt's analysis and his colleagues' original terrapod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
In Tawa Hallae’s skull, for example, the researchers found evidence of air vacuums that the birds also have in their descendants.
The air vacuum makes the breathing of birds more effective than the insects.
In Tawa Hallae, the bones of the back were obviously partially filled with air.
Tawa's the oldest and most primitive terropod with air vacuums, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative lines of huge sauropods later had air waxes and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestor of both groups created this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most famous dinosaurs ever lived in South America, scientists exported that the messengers appeared there for the first time.
According to this, three development lines have been divided early and have spread from South America to all continents that were then as a supercontinent of Pangea, forming a united earthly meat.
She would also speak about the fact that the team found the remains of two others with Tawa Hallae, not particularly close relative terrorpods.
Those three cannot come from a common, immigratory ancestor, the scientists argument.
We believe that there were at least three migration waves in North America, says Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a coautor of scientific studies.
Of course, there are also disputes.
Another older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to the group of the most difficult dinosaurs, lived in Poland today, says the Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His assumption could bring together an illustrated image, because many primitive fossils of dinosaurs remained preserved in South America, with rarely when on other continents.
As the dinosaurs have proved that the relatively rare sidelines of the plasma rod have developed to ruling converters on earth in the mid - century times, they remain a mystery.
During the trias, dinosaurs shared their lifespace with many other beaches, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying gysters and the number of other gutters.
At the end of the trias, dinosaurs spread across the world and many new species developed, while relatives died and the trias and jury interfaces.
The History of Success has not lasted forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been mass extinction that dinosaurs accidentally survived, but no beach.
Or the dinosaurs adjusted better, so they could push the competition.
The history of success did not last forever.
150 million years later, the struggle of the meteority to another group of animals that also developed in the trias and lived in the shadows since then.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
There are professors of University Toronto, University of Cambridge, Vienna University or Berkeley in California.
The docents from Neapol, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paul, Berlin or Brem joined.
The police cleaning of the busy casino of the Frankfurt University of Goethe took care of the world's disturbance.
278 professors and teachers of the University of Goeth, as well as high schools across Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidarised with protesting students in Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "don't approve" by the presidency of an incited police intervention.
Because walls and art works were scratched, the university president Werner Müller-Estler had to clean up the building that the striking students and lecturers had taken over last week.
Five students were injured.
The damage to the matter, the signatories, do not justify the "violent dissolving of self-organized learning of students and teaching police commands".
Cleaning represents "unappropriate intervention" in the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "illigibility and criminalization of the protest" and distracts attention from content.
The Bureau has avoided the necessary discussion.
The lecturers call to stop the criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most strikemen did not support real damage.
Administered Protest
Youths of Verdi and the German Union are also solidarised by students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern about its own future, says the mysterious Earth Youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
The Hesen Minister of Science, Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), are currently defending the procedure of the university president and police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destruction and employment are completely unacceptable, she said on Thursday in Actuellen Stunde (Aktual hour) in the Wisbaden Earth House.
We have understanding for the protest, but we have no understanding for vandalism, said the Messenger of the Earth's Snow for the CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition fractions of SPD, Greens and Links saw it.
The CDU takes painted walls for a reason to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and requirements of students, there were cleansing.
Lincle filed a proposal that calls on the Minister of Interior to report on the police station.
New Silicon-Valley
Long years have been paid for a secret city that is not available to visitors from the West.
Greengrad, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a strictly guarded location where a secret armed research was conducted.
Today this district is considered with 216 000 inhabitants, 37 miles away from the Moscow center, as "Russian Silicon Valley".
There are significant micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres.
Since September 2008, Green City representatives have been contacting the Frankfurt Scientific Centre Riedberg - with university institutions and firms of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and they signed on Wednesday in Frankfurt Greengrad and Ridberg "The Protocol on Close Cooperation".
The Russian delegation led the Moscow multiannual Jurij Rosljak and the prefect of the Green City Anatolij Smirnov, for Frankfurt, the leading referee of planning Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will be headed to a seminar to Greengrad.
Scientific exchange
It's a periodic scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
Fiscal companies will be allowed to be captured on the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian Scientific Companies want to get orders in Germany.
Greengrad is the seat of significant Russian research institutions and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large concerts of Sitronics and the Russian Electronic.
The period was established in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for armed research.
Greenegrad (relevant translation "Green City") obtained its name according to the forested hill landscapes in which the research facilities are planted.
Stuttgart brake
The size of Stuttgart 21 can not be prepared at all sufficiently.
The project's favors are completely simple for the "new heart of Europe".
S21 is more than a railway launch, more than a monster building that will throw the capital of Badenska-Württemberska for a decade into the desperate construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 came from spirit in the 1980s.
The main stations with railways that ended in the center of the city were then considered to be transport and technical fossils in the 19th century, which acts as brakes of modern railway transport, because it took enormously much time to cross locomotives from the back of the front.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, it's supposed to work.
And that's why the head station disappears: Frankfurt and Monk.
And in Stuttgart: Travel Station, which is located nearly in the middle of the trans-European railwayway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, is why the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
It really begins with S21, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with the fact.
Very ambitious designers have learned that the construction is almost unfundable in the Hesen and Bavorian city.
Since modern cyvadle trains with motor and control vehicles on both sides have no problems with riding and riding.
However: It begins with Stuttgart 21, including new ICE trails to Ulmu.
It's made by land and community politicians.
The roads cooperate, even because the risk of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic is a taxpayer, not a state concertency.
Urbanistically, the project can be apologised in another way.
There will be a new urban space that - if we trust computer images of designers - will contain a lot of green.
For the railway transport system S21 is harmful.
Travel railways and railway construction are designed for personal transport, which, typically in the 1980s, has been associated with a huge increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights then.
Modern transport policy must, however, go first on strengthening the car transport, because railway transport is much more ecological than the carriage on the road.
But the new trail is not suitable for cargo trains because of a rapid rising.
More seriously, S21 directly touches a lot of other railway projects.
In Sweden, good six billion euros were to be buried.
It's an official number.
Experts consider 10 to 15 billion real.
It is clear that in the next decade, finances will be missing for the next nodes and tight nets in the network.
There are 60 larger projects on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important things is the construction of about 180 miles of a long route by the Rina Valley.
Since 1987, it's made it slow.
We'd need to push it right here.
But S21 will be like a brake.
The trail in the Rina valley will become the throat of the bottle of international cargo transport: directly in the heart of Europe.
The government is investigating the judgment on the airport
The nation's government has left open in the Wiesbaden Earth House if it goes against the judgment of the Hesen Administrative Court (VGH) on the ban of night flights and will let it be revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition committed experts to legally assess more than 400-page VGH judgment, said the Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel today has written reasons for the State to re-establish the night's ban of flights in the event of the construction of the northwestern ranvey of the Frankfurt airport.
The authorization of 17 years between 23 and 5 hours, as the earthly government assumes, does not correspond to the law of the protection of the population against night air noise.
The coalition must be decided by 4 January if it requires revision of the judgment.
The opposition criticised this delay and insisted on the representative of the government to deny the revision of the Social Administrative Court in Libya.
The chief of the SPD fraction, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, called for CDU and FDP to return to the promises on the ban of night flights that she gave before the election. Otherwise it is possible to evaluate as "breach of the word".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, said the chief of Green Tarek Al-Wazir in the front of the FDP electoral slogan "We hold the word."
Minister Posch refused the Schäfer-Gümbela lift, the country's government is trying to get to his night flights through "crimination of law and tricks".
The exact legal control needs time.
The coalition doesn't want to work on the "fast first impression".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The words of his fraction to ban night flights were never as opposition.
American banks pay the help
The American, the crisis of the great banks is getting rid of the state liaison.
The Bank of America paid suddenly the aid from Tarp's bank rescue fund in the total amount of $45 billion (approximately 30 billion euros).
According to the US CNBC report, Citigroup also plans to pay State aid.
In this way, the institutions want to eliminate the limits to which money has been taken -- the limitation of the payment of bonuss to managers and the refund of high fees.
The Bank of America has obtained good $19 billion from the investors.
The remaining amount was taken from its treasure, which was, inter alia, filled with trade sales.
Kenneth Lewis, head of the bank on Wednesday night, expressly thanked the American taxpayer: Money injection helped us to overcome the difficult time.
The monetary institution has damaged the top of the financial crisis by taking over Merrill Lynch's investment bank.
Citigroup also wants to release its commitments to the State by receiving money on the capital market.
The CNBC was informed with the appeal to the source that this US bank could notify already on Thursday an increase in capital of approximately $20 billion.
The Citigroup speaker didn't want to say that.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley were already paid for help.
Quick Selection
It just went faster than it was expected.
The station presented the successor only two weeks after the ZDF Board pushed the Office of Chief Editor Nikolaus Brender.
Last night the grammy wanted to be agreed on that person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in Berlin, was marked as a favorite.
But the station hasn't confirmed it - officially not to go ahead of the trial.
However, the role could also be that they did not want to harm the ZDF Marcus Schächter if this proposal had not passed by the Governing Council.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of 14 members of the gramy.
The result of the vote was not known before the conclusion of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter lost his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
For Brender, only seven members voted against him. Brender's loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, even though it was expected.
The majority of the Union in the Administrative Council has signaled a few weeks before the election that it does not want to confirm Brender in the office.
Resistance to the Chief Editor was organized by the Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to keep the office of a highly respected chief editor by argumenting that the quotas of monitoring of the ZDF reporting were dropped for Brender.
So, shortly before the election, protests have been criticised by a political influence on the ZDF.
The last time the debate included even 35 national legal lawyers who have considered Koch's procedure as a constitutional.
It was no use.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogics and romantics.
Then he worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 Frey went to ZDF, first to "heute-journal".
Next station: 1988-1990 personal reference manager; 1991/92 a writer in Washington; until 1998 leader and moderator "Morgenmagazins"; 2001 head of foreign policy of ZDF; from then to the main ZDF study.
After Brender, who was elected on Wednesday by Medium Magazine as a journalist of the year, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional lawsuit.
Koch's counter-candidate in the Governing Council, the Rico-Falsh Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the United States should change the state contract with the ZDF so that the personal intendance proposals could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Beck, however, also rejected the exclusion of foreign politicians from the Overseer Board of ZDF.
Brender's presumed successor Peter Frey ordered the Administrative Council with a smart chess move - immediately after the Brender sealing, he criticised a strong grammar for that.
Thanks to this evidence of journal independence, he could be nominated as the head of the editor without losing his face as Schächter, so he could be elected by the Governing Council without suspicion of being pushed into the office.
In the side aritmetic, Frey is still attached to the left liberals.
Study Reduced Harampades
Partial success for students: After the year of strike, the Ministers of Culture finally took place on Thursday in the Communities: At the conference of Ministers of Culture and College Rectors, both parties agreed that it was the will of improving the study conditions for bacalars and magisters.
Students should be able to manage their study in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the load of tests: In general, each study module should be completed with one single test.
Furthermore, the workload of students should be checked, and it should be guaranteed "real and defence measure".
Politicians and high schools want to simplify recognition of trials between high schools in Germany and abroad.
Federal countries are committed to creating a more flexible common structural assignment for bacalary and magistical study obstructions.
Earth deviations should cease to exist.
Less Tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in the worm, the ministers of culture and universal rectors had cried words of better study in their mouth.
Now they're first filled with specific content.
The so-called accreditation council concluded that the number of tests is partly drastically reduced: "Each module will normally be completed by only one test," says the 30-page report, which should partly regulate the approval of the study fields.
"Explicitly lower test burden," said the President of the Reinhold Grimm Accreditation Council, "is to stop the mistaken development which significantly limited the difficulty of study."
This should be the "expectation of study" in the future of "decisive criteria" in the implementation.
Modules and contents are "Must be hardly checked" so that "do not limit students at the choice
The seminars."
Students should have "acquisition for space that allows and supports their own initiative".
The rules should apply in approval of new study fields, after reviewing, but also for existing studies.
It is necessary to "preaccredit" every five years – which, however, means that it will last until 2015 before all studies are verified.
There are ten accreditative agencies all over Germany who are subject to the accreditation councils established by the common countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture challenged the United States to influence the agencies so that the completion of the teaching is not too large and the test regime is not strict.
In individual communities, universities and high schools have already agreed with the country ministries on appropriate measures.
As so far, the only country has promised Porinie-Falco additional means for further development of the Bologne process.
Money, primarily high schools, should build consultative programmes and study advice, and strengthen the expert and foreign authorities.
This is what countries and high schools want to make up ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, he wants to rule in Parliament a novel of the universal law.
According to it, only one test should be required to end the study module.
The forming of the study should be even more flexible, thus guaranteeing recognition of tests from other high schools and facilitating my access to the master.
By the end of the next year, the difficulty of all studies in the country should be verified.
The government and opposition again argued about the study conditions in the country on Thursday.
In addition to praise, the criticism of the resolution also fell.
Juso's Social Representative of High School Groups called for not to play "for closed doors" of ministers and high-school rectors in the future.
Later after the strike, the students as subjects should "speak at least a word" also.
The future academy also received support from the President of the University Rectors Conference (HRK), Margreta Wintermantel: "We need student experiences," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture with whom the HRK was consulting on a joint reform report.
According to the Committees for Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolution has not gone sufficiently far: They require legal privilege that would allow each graduate with a bacalary title to access the construction master study.
Secondly, the states must ensure that for today's generation of students the bacal area is available enough places in the magisterial study fields with the best study conditions, said the member of GEW Andreas Keller.
The social countries must hire much more lecturers.
But the Ministers of Culture did not speak to free access to master programs.
More than a note on Herta Müller
To get to Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." The introductory line of one poetry of Werner Söllner, who in this erected linguistic piece discusses the experience of a disident who won freedom, also lost his linguistic environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Romanian Banate, first worked as German teacher and English in Bucharest and later as a teacher of a child’s book publisher, then moved to Frankfurt over Mohan.
Söllner was awarded by different literary prices, 1993 lectured a poetry at the legendary Frankfurt University of Goethe, and since 2002 he was head of the Hesen Forum of Literature in Mousonturm, Frankfurt.
A significant extra-literary disturbance took care of last Tuesday at a seminar in Mnichov, which was about "German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken mirror of its security acts".
Apparently, the infected Söllner left a statement in which Romanian German writers, namely Richard Wagner, William Took, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, confessed to cooperate as a secret informant of Romania secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the presents, Söllner received the German Language Price in 1989.
The attempts for recruitment began unthinkablely, first in 1971.
I'm, continued Söllner, "then someone who didn't defend enough attempts to frighten Securitate."
Poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent Walter.
Almost at the same time, with Herta Müller's Nobel Prize and her inappropriate literary dealing with the dictatory government mechanisms, the literary scene is, and especially the German authors' communities originating in Romania, are in a shame in the case that marks depths and shame of the political system based on control and spicking.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said according to the real state of knowledge, only a perpetrator, but also a victim.
In the Securitate records, a secret agent Walter played a role, said after Söllner's confession, Michael Markel, and pointed out a positive impact on himself by secret agent Walter.
"He's cutting me out" at all the important points for him then, says Markel.
It's morally obliged to make this note.
The statement of Söllner was in this form and unexpected before this audience, but it was not a surprising confession of the former disident and his cooperation with Romania's secret service.
Herta Müller wrote in July when she read her own records, 914 pages that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the securitate spicles.
Dossiers, can be assumed, will speculate and, in some cases, probably know what the name is hiding behind the covert name Sorin, Voic, and Walter, too.
Otherwise, in the country, while a very certain examination of the Passe, manipulation with the remaining control of Securitate is still very difusive.
In the past years, systematic education has been wasted and limited.
One of the Birthler's offices, which corresponds to the National Council for the processing of Securitate (CNSAS), was established only in 1999, and the issue of the act has been held quite long since then.
Only since 2005 there is a law that manages the management of the files.
That former members of the Securitate have still a major influence in Romania, he reported after the publication of the Nobel Price for Herta Müller, a conversation in which one of the former heads of Securitate from Temeshwar expressed the appreciation holder denied.
He said his psychiatricism was only interrogated once after all.
The absorption of power was expressed completely incorporated in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, Söllner's case, as in relation to silenced pronecution, is addressed by inevitable questions.
The special response of the listeners to Söllner's confession allows us to expect the continuation of this chapter to determine the desire for knowledge rather than the claim of guilt and shame.
To Herta Müller's genesis, who accepted the Nobel Price yesterday, it's more than a note under line.
Saturated contribution Champions League
It seemed like a purely dressed trader from a cute Christmas party, at which the manufacturer of sports goods of sweethearts was handling when he was coming about a quarter of an hour after midnight to the called Mercedes of Class C a new coach VfBr Christian Gross in accompanying orangely colored sponsor bag.
The man with a markant baldness has driven another foreign city because of him.
Otherwise, he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and he was lucky to be a 55 - year - old man too.
It was a nice night, but tomorrow it'll continue to work.
Or it's just starting.
Words only three days of the Swiss engaged: "We have achieved the 8-final" in the Champions League victory3:1 over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves shine with success: It will be a brutally hard fight against accommodation."
"Most important task" stands in front of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the Royal Class in Mohuc and in the ordinary League Day.
And avoid re-explicit weaknesses after the three rapid goals of Marice (5.), Träsche (8.) and Pogrebnyak (12).
Smoothing
Osmifinal Champions League (fetch 16/17. + 23./24 February/retailing 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be held in Nyon on 18 December.
The joy of the babel’s successor will therefore remain.
Not only with a suspected healer who added uncertain stattgart professionals during a short period of self-consciousness, willingness to plant and joy from the game.
I went to the players and told them that they were to focus on their strong pages and I encouraged them to be more courageous, explained the healer of the souls of Gross so simply sounding a successful recipe, but for the effect of the therapist, Babbel, did not show no more effectiveness.
He was sneaking some magic, acknowledged Babbel's fan Jens Lehmann, "if a new impulse comes in football, there are sometimes things that you don't think possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a weekly break caused by injury, became his dynamic immediately the best player on the field, tried to describe the discovered "phenomene" by the "free wind" and the working procedures of the new superior: "He is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the present situation."
Apparently, Babbel missed it.
VfB Stuttgart is not saved yet, warns Sports President Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
Like Gross, even players and managers do not want to overestimate victory against a weak replacement and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would also win in Glasgow before the ugly awakening came after defeat 0:4 in Leverkusen, he considers Khedir.
And the sports president Horst Heldt reminded that, although one goal in the season was achieved, the other one is far away.
We're not behind the water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate at his 40th birthday even after the first home victory after three months, it was caused by weekend events that freshly lived in the form of a television conversation with Mr. Jens Lehmann in front of the match.
There are decisions that active others and not Jens responded to the hard Lehmann's criticism.
He was pre-filled to a weak leadership and decided to change the coach after the puberty of puberty fans.
Even the cancellation of his day off after the fights, Lehmann marked as a sign of missing sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's words "forms pure egoism," he answered Heldt and announced the consequences for the branners.
Both of the 40s will probably have no joy in their life.
Anyway, they're on their side with each other that without the work of the trainee team, it would not be possible to play so strong and fighting.
Babbel and his assistants had a "great share of success," say Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man with the igelit bag agrees.
Fighting the world's championship in heavy weight
Your duel in Bern: The challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of the Master of the World of Vitalia Klička.
However, after twelve hard wheels, the Ukrainian defended his title in the heavy weight of the WBC boxer organization.
The verdict's statement was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitalij Kličko remains the master of the world in a box of heavy weight.
38-year-old WBC champion defeated on Saturday on Saturday in Bern American Kevin Johnson on a loud basis at points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klick, it is the third successful defense of the title after his return in October 2008.
Previously, Ukrainian was twice the WBO and WBC world champion.
Unfortunately, it didn't come to the.o. that everyone expected.
Kličko improved his balance to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice been defeated by injury.
The challenger Johnson was first defeated in the 24th battle.
About 17,000 audiences in the Bernard arena he drove 2,02 meters high Kličko battle mainly with his left.
At 11 inches of smaller Johnson, who before duel announced the end of the Klickov era, was downloaded before the attacks of the master of the world, so Kličko could not plant a decisive hit by his dangerous right hand.
In general, passive Johnson made it very little on the challenger and just tried to get into the other wheels.
Although the click provoked words and gestures, his hits but the master of the world hit only a few times.
But yet it's only the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, who fought full of twelve wheels with Click.
The challenger took care of disturbance in Switzerland’s capital before the fight.
He insulted Click like a "free zombie", which "nothing can do right."
During the estimation on Friday, the champion was allowed to provoke, pull Johnson's sunglasses off his nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Click's return
Kličko remained unbeaten after the fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008.
After a nearly four-year break then, he defeated in Berlin Nigerian Samuel Peter and took back his "his" WBC belt, which he had to give up without fighting before.
This year he defeated the title of Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreol of the United States.
In this fight I only got one shot and physically in good shape, I justified Kličko fast return to ring.
But his dream remains the defense of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is a world champion of WBO and IBF organisations.
The WBA belt wears, however, Brit David Haye, after he settled from the throne of 2,13 meters of Nicolaj Vulajevo in November.
Haye denied the summer fight against Klickov, which was planned for September.
Its promotional company is allegedly planning a fight against Klickov at the London Wembley Stadium.
Case Kunduz
The head of the opposition: The Chief of the Green Faction Jürgen Trittin marked the wrong information about the affair Kunduz defence minister Guttenberg as a liar.
SPD and Links (Lefts) call for a chancellor for explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest knowledge of the attack on Kunduz, opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed aware fraud.
The Minister for the Death Bombing of Two Cisterns in September said "with awareness of falseness," the chief of the Green Yurgen Trittin fraction said in the Saturday reporting show ARD "Tageschau".
Let's call it the usual expression: he lied.
The murder order was issued in disrespect of the rules of the International Security Support Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the principle of the NATO report that Mr Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it showed that the attack was not only the destruction of cars kidnapped, but the targeted murder of two Taliban leaders.
In an American attack required by the German Commander Kunduz Colonel Klein, the NATO investigation suggests that 142 people have been killed or injured.
Greens, SPD and Linke called on a joint chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to express her immediately in front of the Federation and also explain what Guttenberg really knew about this event.
Mrs Merkel has to explain whether the strategy of targeting killing is part of the Afghan Politics of the Social House - and, if the Office of Officer, Bundeswehr and the rapporteur service have approved this new strategy, the Jürgen Trittin and the colleague of the Green Renate Künast.
The government speaker Ulrich Wilhelm definitely rejected the criticism.
The Office of the Officer has no effect on the specific placement of Bundeswehra in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also no doubts about the treatment of the Ministry on the background of the release of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both Guttenberg were informed correctly and fully about the background of the attack on tanks.
Officially, they were to deny the existence of NATO reports and silence the Minister with sensitive details.
However, from the area of both top officials, the Ministry of Defence was notified even of several reports, including a two-sided document of Colonel Klein and a report from the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sontagsheitung" reports that Wichert was meant to request in a letter of clarification of the situation.
It is noted that he has not received any answer yet.
The Ministry did not speak on Saturday and pointed out that this would be dealt with in the Investigation Committee of the Social Charter, which will be established next Wednesday.
The worlds of dreams
Some see images in awake and hear voices that others can't see and hear.
Not only mentally ill or drug connections are linked to the limits between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in the sleep, everything's fine.
If we're lying closed eyes in our dark room, we can surround the wildest ideas and fantasies.
However, who experiences awake in dreams, sees and hears things that others can't see and hear, mostly in today’s Western world is a fool or a drug addict, or at least as a freak.
However, such images and voices are not only in the mentally ill or in drug connection.
The guilt has our imagination: The same neuronal processes that allow us to propose houses, paint images or write romans, will make sure that the borders between dream, imagination and reality are connected here and there.
A changed state of consciousness can occur in different forms, in a better case, we call them visions, in worse voids.
Even though the initialator and effect can differ, the visions of Hildegar von Bingen, drug experiences of the New Age Carlos Castanedy, the shaman states of blundering, psychos and halucinations can be distracted from similar processes.
Halucinations or visions will occur if the balance of neuronal brain transmitters is eliminated - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and fraudulent thoughts occur very often in schizofren psychology.
Gravity has no power over it.
The bond between looseness and dream has been employed by philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotels understood the hallucinations as a form of dream in awake, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, founded in 1861 "a great similarity of lying with tangible states", for Sigmunda Freud was a dream even "psychia, with all nonsense, translusion, deception of senses".
It's autumn 2001, Henning T. is transforming into a comic figure.
His body is double-dimensional and screamingly colored.
The gravity has no power over it, it rises up at the ceiling of room.
He feels a bump.
Behind him, crooked hell figures with bloody red grimas, valuing teeth.
They're chasing him, digging into him with heavy, fired shoes, throwing him around the wall, feeling pain all over the body.
Volume, bad voices are threatened from the walls and from the radio.
He can't stand the voices that give him and insult him anymore.
Henning T. takes two cables out of the stereo, takes them into the loop and puts it on a hook on the ceiling.
He gets on one reproductor, and he's got a pin around his neck.
He's jumping.
The slide allows.
Learn, the congregation's voices screaming his drums, "Go to the clinic and let me be treated!"
Today Henning T. 40 years ago, experienced six acute psychosis, last two years ago, first almost 20 years ago.
They were launched by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoafective paranoic psychosis, but also maniodepressive, taking medicines against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned how to live with his illness. He's been married for three years.
I've experienced the worst fear and the deepest doubts, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality
Approximately one percent of people are sick at least once in the life of schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics, it is after depression of the second most commonly treated disease.
In acute schizofren psychology, the infections cannot distinguish mostly from the internal and external world, they get into awakened state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusion or illusion of persecution.
Especially expanded is hearing votes - votes that command, comment or lead dialogues.
Even optic hallucinations are not unusual.
Infected is unable to distinguish importantly from unsignificant, the brain cannot filter disrupting signals, consciousness is flooded with the impression.
Just like the dream opens the psychology has built a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychology is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, high doctor of the Clinics of the universal psychiatric clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizofrenik is located in the center of action, everything is important to him.
At the same time, it gets into a passive role, it becomes, like in the dream, overcome by events and cannot actively form them.
Therefore, Schizofrenia often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
The comparison with reality is not mostly possible for them, the ghosts are a terrible reality, the awakening is excluded.
Once for life, hallucinations
Otherwise, Fuchss says, "but there is a senseful and space structure of the fact that people perceive in psychology, essentially preserved."
The fraudulent thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the deception of experience occurs in a real framework.
The scientist still stands in front of a mystery why our brains are making such a turnover.
Extraordinary states can lead to a short-term loss of relationship with reality, says Fuchs.
But not everyone gets into psychology.
It seems that there is a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists come from the minimal brain damage.
We believe that in the early stage of development there will be damage to neuronal brain failure, such as the mother's viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery of how there will be a breakthrough of the neuronal system, which has not been shown for years.
The role also plays the effects of the environment - stress or traumatic experiences can be an initiator of psychology if it is available.
Halucinogenic drugs can also start psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain cooks
It's crazy that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive medicinal products, others give money for drugs to get them, says Erich Kasten's psychology professor from Lübeck.
If we perceive the transgressions as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often just a question of attitude.
Kasten has been gathering reports about hallucinations and prehumanities for the past year, interpreting his results in the book "Die ireale Welt in unserem Kopf" (Inreal world in our head).
The hallucination belongs to typical phenomenons of psychosis, but also to surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as border personality or depression, often diseases such as migraine, epilepsia, distorted sclerosis or Alzheimer or brain trauma.
Surprisingly halucinates under certain conditions also the brain of a healthy person.
The hallucinations, according to Casten, consist of the contents of thoughts that are normally oppressed.
They arise when parts of the brain processing sensitive senses are too active or uncontrolled; if our brain cooks, or if there is no stimulation.
Drugs can start this condition as well as brain damage or psychology.
But also the abduction of stimulations, stress, concerns with love or other exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, only one third of the questioned people had hallucinations experienced at least once in their life.
In the summer 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mexico-Front Maritime and attending a secondary high school.
Actually, it's a totally normal girl.
If there were no pictures and voices.
The breaks can happen to call her a colonel with long, dark hair.
When he answers, the students look at her with a surprise - no one sees her and hears this boy.
This silly girl considers a dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't eat, she knows.
She's up, she hears and sees that boy, exactly as she hears and sees a girl sitting next to her in the club.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, she likes that boy.
Am I crazy? He asks once.
But he knows that this boy and other nonsense are not real and he'll disappear again.
The phenomenons are more embarrassing at night
Frequently, it's a burden.
When he's sitting in class, he can't watch the teaching several times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears just represents a new classmate, but he explains to all the others in a sensitive and visible manner on the mathematical equation table.
The phenomenons are more embarrassing at night.
When he waits in his dark room for a sleep that comes shortly and too late, he can often distinguish whether he's up or sleeping, whether the images he sees, grimases, or girls with bleeding cutting wounds on his hands and legs appear in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she's screaming at those figures.
They don't tell parents and friends about it, they'd think she's crazy.
It's autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated and lives with her boyfriend in the year.
The hallucinations stopped a year ago.
Since Casten's psychologist contacted the Internet, she knows exactly she's not mad.
Transluces are also art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or is taken from stimulations, he'll have a great probability of hallucination, says Kasten.
I think the brain doesn't have enough jobs then, and it takes care of its own fun.
Sarah K., the only girl, was afraid of other children, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when at 13, she learned that the man whom Dad's been calling since when she thought she wasn't her own father.
Because visual and acustical hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that also process real ideas and sounds, it is difficult to distinguish from each other the fraud and reality. "Every experience," Kasten says, "It occurs in the brain, and the reality is also presented there.
Halucinations are also images that let the brain occur, so it works so real."
The night dreams also evaluate Kasten as a form of hallucination.
The hallucination of healthy people is not essentially different from hallucination in acute psychology.
In contrast to schizofrenics, people are mentally healthy, capable of identifying their frauds as unreal.
Casten therefore advises his patients to evaluate hallucinations as extraordinary ability.
Border status between dream and hallucination
In our world too concentrated to awareness, the imaginary experience is mostly pathologised, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor in Heidelberg and the Psychiatric and Psychiatric Hospital Clinic Florence-Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
Psychology is a severe, tough disease, but it also brings positive, creative - translucency is also art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied a so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of changed consciousness for sleep.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams that the concerned considers real and cannot distinguish them from awake.
The oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness, such as polyradicular experience patients who experience full awareness of motor disorders.
When a person threatened by the loss of the world and himself, perhaps the lasting, complete incapability of movement, replaces life threatening the real situation with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
The type of border status between dream and hallucination.
Because in reality there is no way to deal with a situation, there will be a change in worlds, but the real situation will be present to the imagination.
The intense form of support for the senses and transfer of senses into some inconvenient situation that allows us to form our own ability to go through the moment to lose consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memories
Also, a historian of art Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (Herzwechsel) as a rescue action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when his consciousness was released on a multiple-day journey after the heart cloth operation, while his body lived on an intense care unit.
Claussen flooded into the world that he created, visited abroad times and places: He becomes an old man attached to bed, in the train sanatorium, the robot guards his health.
He lives in the early Middle Age between the nobility that produces blood-made substances.
On the motorcycle, the Greek will take him to his country, surfing on the hospital bed in the Alps and meet the Korean mafian.
It's going to be completely in imaginary, everything's real, even later in memories.
These internal journeys are essentially different for Claussen from any dream.
The dream is a different state, describes his experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of those mental paths have been clear after years and in unrelevant details.
Even clearer and more intense than real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizont of our other true experience, says Schmidt-Degenhard psychiatrist.
In the end, they show oniroid states, psychologies, hallucinations and drug connections, as fragile as well as in the awake of our internal images are outside.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Casten, "can lead to deformation of what we call reality."
Reality that can also be enriching.
Snow can come
Burda
At 27 years, children are to take over the supplies
The new Managing Manufacturer Kallen is a transitional solution: Hubert Burda has long wished to hand his business into the hands of both of his children, said SPIEGEL.
Holding has to belong to the future in 100 percent of the family.
Hamburg - Computer Hubert Burda sees his business for a long time in the hands of his children.
Both children will inherit at 27 years and have a firm will to enter the company, says 69-year-old SPIEGEL.
We were carefully dealing with it.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is to be postponed.
Even the question is if they're capable of it.
It cannot be built to the head of 7500 employees of their children unless they are capable enough.
That would kill both the kids and the business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he was retrieving from the Presidency from January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
52-year-old Kallen has been a member of Burdy's office since 1999.
First he was in charge of technology.
Later, with the section, the Treasure added responsibility for the property of the company and after the retirement of Jürgen Todenhöfer, also the direct marketing, the Citizen, the press and the Finance.
For the first time, none of the family members are headed by the publisher.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Callen's name is also used to "close 10, 15 years," Burd told.
Holding should also belong to a family 100 percent in the future, Burda says.
In view of the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda expressed that even family businesses have no certainty before the disappearance: "It has always affected companies that have been infected by the desire of capital that they speculated and thought they could become big players.
It was never my strategy.
He never had "the dreams of the world power," Burda says.
I don't think of this country as a political preceptor like Springer, and I don't want to play a world league with "Time", these trades are too large.

Escotes variados
Christmas is coming, and that's the time it's appropriate to find out what celebrites wear, and to adapt to it as well as their ceremony.
The face of the cut is very important to emphasize the figure, which is necessary to be aware.
We're introducing several proposals.
Fergie's singer chose an extravagant and very complicated cut.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electromobile
The Endes Endes energy company and Barcelone's council founded the Live Office.
It is a project for the development and promotion of electromobile in the capital of Catalan.
Live's office (Electromobile Logistics) shall establish and manage a travel plan for the introduction of electrical vehicles in the city and ensure mobility agreements, organise, coordinate and present contributions, etc.
It will also develop the project MOVELE, promote electromobile, collect opinions and results of the activities in the sectors involved.
In general, the aim is to support this future transport.
3 'Electric Cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the project of introduction of electric vehicles in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will also join the project.
It is three cities chosen by the government within the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electrical vehicles.
Endes' energy company has already signed the framework contract with the Catalan government.
The aim is to promote research and technological development activities in the catalan autonomous area.
This includes energy-related activities and energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative with the participation of Endesa in promoting electromobile.
The company is represented in European normalisation teams and actively implements a number of additional projects, such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts the 'climate period' in the car industry.
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, predicts that the Spanish car industry, the main exporting sector of the state, is waiting for the "climate period".
In the 2009 Government's economic report, Zapatero summarized the measures introduced during the year for the support of the car sector.
"Beyond the Competitive Plan for the Automotive Industries, we would have been waiting for the state of desertivity today, closing some of our main production businesses," stated the government's chairman.
"Thanking this plan and the wish of individual marks to continue to work in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of peace in this industry, which is our main export sector, is predictable to the future," he added.
In this regard, he underlined that the competitive plan forming part of the Integrated Automotive Industries Plan (PIA) set 800 million for projects of 19 producers and 137 subsidiary companies that mobilised the investment exceeding 3 billion euros.
The President explained that this investment was intended to develop new models, to modernise production and existing processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government measures to support the request and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is applied in collaboration with autonomous areas and car marks.
According to the president, this plan has made it possible to reduce 6% of the average emissions in new vehicles sold in the Spanish market, and ensures a significant increase in the records, specifically in November by "40 per cent".
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first International Hall of Classical Vehicles will be opened, which is a space for meetings of professionals and amateurs from the world of motors.
This initiative will take place on 5 - 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavillon of Madrid Casa de Campo.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, which will represent more than 200 foreign and foreign exhibitors.
Here you can find not only classic motorcycles and cars but in ClassicAuto Madrid also products of all types related to the world of engines.
Exhibitors in pavillon will offer accessories, replacement parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, publications, miniatures etc.
Thousands of products relating to classic engines, real flavors for collectors and custodians.
Among the companies involved will be the following:Clasicos de Mos and Good Old Times, sale of cars; Juan Lumbreras, renewal; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and renewal of cars; or Cochera Clasicos, specialized Mercedes Benz.
External eligibility tests
Furthermore, the commercial activity of this saloon will be complemented with parallel activities: focusing, sports performance, testing, presentation and competition.
The eligibility tests will also be performed in classical cars and motorcycles in the adjusted circle outside the exhibition zone.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Conservation of sports style
Mazda is going to show that precaution to the environment does not have a negative impact on sports style.
And therefore Mazda3 has a built stop and engine launch system - baptized also as-Stop-, which is currently available only with gasoline engine 2.0 150 horses.
This second generation Mazda3 is characterized by good characteristics that it has achieved as a whole.
Surface adjustment, vehicle performance, population, behavior, mechanic, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent in Mazda3.
The front seats of the driver's seats have excellent ergonomy and are greatly fixed.
The wheel is also extremely gentle.
Using the tools and console composition, we conclude that Mazda continues to develop a futuristic design with many buttons and drivers and a significant red and blue color.
This style partially reminds us of the style that is also presented by Honda Civic.
So we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, are contradicting the soberness of German products and, in particular, more sVolkswagen Golf that everyone wants to defeat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than a sufficient space for four adults who wish a very comfortable ride.
Furthermore, a large baggage space and regular forms should be mentioned.
The automatic stop and engine starting system is currently available only with a gasoline engine on two litres and 150 horse forces assistence hand transmission.
This engine is a real flavor. It is very gentle, marked with a lower noise level, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most desirable Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not find so many miles a year should not exclude this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, because it is marked with greater comfort in driving and reduced consumption.
With regard to equipment, the version selected for testing is named Sportive and includes more serial elements.
For serial equipment, it is necessary to mention primarily the tracking system (RVM), which prevents the formation of a dead angle, control of track and stability, speed control, internal mirror sensitive to light, aboard computer with a large screen, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain sensor and light, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and wheels of 17-inch.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped Pack Premium, for an extra 1.500 euro: adaptable lights of twoxenone and sound system BOSE with the CD holder, except for other parts.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compatible cars of his category.
It shall be defined primarily by the quality of the materials used, by its operation and its high level of equipment.
Furthermore, people who do not find a larger number of miles a year can choose this i-Stop version, which is only with gas engines2.0 and 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is 21.770 euros for Luxury and 23.270 euros in a tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price, Mazda3 offers us a great dose of satisfaction for each day.
Luxury 'Premier'
L.A. has a red carpet, gentle like hands of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars were shineing more than ever in the new elegant and sexy models of the Nine mark.
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose dark 'lady'.
FonPeek Promise
The peek is extremely limited, only serves to view the mail, without the possibility to view a certain type of attachments or to surf on the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of glory in the United States when Time magazine appreciated it as one of the year’s products.
To see him outside is harder, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
In contrast to the smartphones, Peek is a very low price and monthly payments, less than a half amount, for example, for iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company started offering two new facilities: one is only intended for Twitter, the other on the basis of a permanently provided free data service, but it is necessary to pay for Peek a six-fold amount.
FonPeek, who was presented yesterday at Le Web, is a European version of invention and also its third transformation.
It's limited as well as his American revolver, but it brings surprises.
The monthly maintenance price is approximately 12 euros per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People traveling with smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the borders or impatiently looking for a coffee with WiFi (or the Fon connection) so that they can check their mail.
The idea of a solid rooming price is incredibly attractive and was to be implemented for a long time.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but according to my experience, a person would need a physics doctorate to understand them, and very good glasses to read the miniature letter.
The European Commission constantly requires the reduction of roaming tarifs in order to be accessible for Europe, which still does not have a sky effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that a device like FonPeek (it is interesting that it still has the name Fon when it does not have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators start thinking differently and consider different offers to compensate their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offers downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is attached and applied for purchase, not after months.
And that's exactly what I expect to happen once in the case of PhonPeek is the possibility of buying a permanent approach like Peek has already been introduced in the United States.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm checking my mail on the phone, thank you.
I'm expecting it, because I think it's the best type of consumer.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used in the computer.
The color Michelle loves
Yellow is definitely the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
For Barack Obama to become President of the United States, she chose dresses and coats in this color, she also chose the same color when she accompanied him at the second most important moment of his life: the transfer of the Nobel Price of Peace in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: except that it was a similar color - yellow green with brightening effects - in both cases it was a classified set - dress, bag and coat from the same substance - decorated with a large elevation or a batch.
At first, it seemed that the First Lady of the United States decided to go in the footsteps of the Asturian princess and wear similar clothes.
The suit from which the clothing is made makes both models significantly different.
At the opportunity to enter Michelle's function, she used a large branch, in Oslo sumet with pressure.
Changes also supplements: green shoes with medium-sized heels, now-like model, but in gold color.
He also wears various hairs: this time a drill, previously dissolved hair.
75% of the working mothers have work problems with maternity.
Labour discrimination has increased over the past years, especially in women of younger ages who are going to acquire a child.
This is the result of the study “Production and Work Career of Spanish Women” carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
Study attended 9.737 women aged from 15 to 75 years and results are clear: 75% of workers have limited opportunities on the labour market because of maternity.
Study emphasizes that at the beginning of partnership, there are many differences in the views of the number of children according to their work or not, as well as in the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside their homes work for partial jobs or have no stable work, start living early with their partner, firstbornborn child and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partnership and maternity are delaying and have less descendants.
"Women from 35 to 49 years of age with stable employment have the first child on average 3.7 years from the beginning of partnership. This number is 4.1 in the case of women who have devoted their stable employment to the majority of their life and therefore had to postpone partnership and children's arrival.
The type of job also has a strong impact on maternity, even though a smaller impact on the start of partnership," explains Margarita Delgado, who is committed to research in CSIC.
Another factor that affects the age of women at the time of the marriage of the descendants is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the degree of education, the higher is the age the women marry and have their first child.
The differences are also among women of the same generation.
For example, in the age of 35 to 49, women with basic and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25.1, denied 32.1.
"There is another difference between women depending on their degree of education.
Women with basic education marry and give birth to the first child before they find stable employment, while women with secondary or high education are proceeding in the opposite way to gain stable employment, before the marriage and the birth of the first child," Delgado says.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to her prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
Since next year, the German actress will become the face of different products of this mark under the universal password 'Cause I'm worth it'.
The representative of 'Joyeux Noil', one of the most elegant actres of the international level, is added to other famous personality L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fund, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
In front of her, the selected actress' club Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Millioner from the Chamber') entered this elected club.
The male part of this mark of cosmetic is also represented by significant characters:Patrick Dempsey (Grey's anatomy) and Matthew Fox (Evangelin's partner in 'Lost').
Prices of British Mode
The British have a lot to talk about fashion issues.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, former and present - met at the annual transfer of prices made in London, on Royal Court of Oss Justice.
No one missed the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen as the best model of the year.
Poker Manuel Vicenta
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Esov poker' (Alfaguara, illustration of Fernando Vicente) thirty X-ray photographs of writers whom he met in his literary life (and in some cases even in common life).
It does not do that in fearful and predictable genres (biographic similarity, life, and work), but is looking for a similar core of creative personality.
The road brings excitement and Vicent doesn't save the leaks or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reader’s benefit, even in repeated reading.
Here's some of the observations.
About Albert Camus: "I found on the pages of this book that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but spiritual impulse, almost physical, as I feel, but it cannot be called: the benefit of destiny, the moral without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "The Nihilist, butgorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature, not intellectual, something between power and ignorance, with a blind poetical humor, without meaning, as if it was a knife of a knife that almost killed him."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been in front of his passion for this woman for all 13 years, adultery, pleasure and regret, which is a spiritual privilege to reach heaven by the way of damnation."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssea issued in Paris in 1922 Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight-month tops in the universal literature which must be overcome from the northern side, from which the best peasants are often destroyed."
About William Faulkner, "He was a strange man.
He said himself he was the heir of the County County, and sometimes he was the son of a black crocodile with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was a great dream."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught a confused scream on the bridge of this man from Mnich to bring his remarks to the night of the 20th century in his literary form, fleeing before himself and calling to the future and toughly speaking to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One time she kneel and prayed, "My dear God, tell me to stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "The verse of Spencer was crushed on his grave: 'After the effort a dream will come,/ after the storm a quiet port,/after the war of rest,/after full life death."
About Virginia Wolf: "He also took his depression in his luggage.
The husband fully agreed to tell him that Eduard VII was watching her between the assales or that the birds sang Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic, whose literary talent is hand-to-handed with crazyness."
About Peo Baroya: "What else was Martin Santos than to focus Joyce on Baroe?
What else was Benet but letting Baroa execute Faulkner's weapon?
What else was it for to Celo but to make a famous punishment for the glory of the man?"
Coward aggression
Last week, my 70 - year - old mother walked through our neighborhood, in Fuenlabrada, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 years passed around, and our dog, a rescue crusade with a weight of at least six pounds, scratched him twice and severely wounded.
Our agitation is that we see nothing fun in such aggression against a small and unprotected animal, which was also on the lead.
And to that end, the shock of the old lady after the incident, when she struggled in the walk with these individuals, she began to worry about her own security, because such a devil who attacks the animal is able to do the same thing to the woman, the child, the old man or anyone who is weaker than he himself.
It happened at 5:00 p.m., Tuesday, usually a quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been crying all day.
Of course, we filed a complaint about the nearest commissionership, but we doubt that it was something, and that we would not raise a blameful question, we conclude that these coward killers were Spanish nationality.
The agitation made us notify this fact.
We do not understand what happens to today’s youths when they have fun with an unprotected animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don't understand where the right education, respect for animals and people went.
Michelin and Fesvial together for use of helm
The manufacturer of tyres Michelin in collaboration with the Spanish Transport Safety Fund (Fesvial) launched a campaign for supporting the use of helms, especially in the younger motorists, as both of these entities have informed today.
The purpose of this initiative is to emphasize the importance of the use of a helmet, as it is the only means to avoid the head injury in case of death in case of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin states that this campaign constitutes part of their obligations relating to transport security, which "seems more than to propose and produce even safer products" and confirmed that it is trying to fulfil this purpose in other ways, i.e. by a form of instruction and information campaign.
This new campaign to support the use of a helmet on the motorcycle, under the password 'To be or not to be', is the first phase when more than 500 motorcycles are repaired will be placed to reach the most widest public.
Finally, Michelin noted that transport security "is a constant problem" of this company, which is the manufacturer of tyres for bicycle vehicles, and its main objective is continuous increase in product safety.
Sales of light use vehicles are increased
Almost two years later, the market of light use vehicles starts to be recovered.
All 9.425 vehicles recorded in November in Spain meant an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more than more, the first increase after 22 months of permanent decline, according to the numbers of data, the patronatic organisation of producers of Anfac and Ganvam.
However, the favourable figure is better to put in quarantine, since November 2008 is a significantly bad period for comparison and was 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, regardless of the rise in the last month, the total number of vehicles registered in the past 11 months is 40% less than in the previous accounting year.
Since January, it was sold 95.853 vehicles, which includes all vehicles that may fall into the category of light use vehicles: personal car derivatives, pick ups, supplies, smaller trucks and light trucks/cars.
And no clouds that are most damaged by demand, even though private persons were purchased, most of the purchases were carried out by smaller and medium-sized companies and 100% of cases were financed through third parties.
Other factors such as stopping or continuing the bad economic situation should be added to restrictions resulting from the closing of the banking loans.
In this situation, unlike personal cars, the shopping support of 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private persons, it is necessary to mention the non-compliances on the animal sheet of small and medium-sized companies who are going to buy a light use car up to 3.5 tonnes with CO2 emissions level not exceeding 160 grams per mile, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvam, they reiterated the need to pay special attention to the management of these vehicles, as well as to industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The Association of Sellers assumes that in 2010 development will be similar to last year and, according to calculations, sales in private cars and 4x4 will fall by 19%.
The help system on the hand brake is already obligatory equipment.
As in the case of the ABS anti-blocking system, this will also be the management of ESP stability, helping hand brake systems, all of this will become the obligatory equipment of European vehicles.
In fact, it is already a part of the compulsory equipment of all newly registered personal vehicles and light use vehicles, while the term for deficiency is determined in others, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aims to increase the protection of walkers, acting in order to help prevent many crashes.
The hand brake system increases the brake pressure in an emergency case, which the system finds after the driver breaks down.
But it can't always keep this pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by Bosch’s manufacturer of car works, a third of the drivers with accidents did not break the brake before the crash, and half of them did not use the brake full.
Until 1.100 accidents
On the contrary, this aid requires the maximum braking system, reducing the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles are equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1,100 death accidents related to walkers would be avoided annually.
The reduction of this number will be even more marked by calculations would prevent one of the four accidents with the impact of people-affecting the introduction of so-called intelligent hand brake systems.
In this case, the vehicles will be equipped with a system that (help the radar or cameras) captures the obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for easy braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help him increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even when the crash cannot be prevented, the device will affect the brake as much as possible and reduce the risk of minimal damage.
General Motors defers the Opel plan until January
Nick Reilly, new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, Opel's employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza), that the production of new Meriv will be launched in the first week of April - probably on April 8th - as Javier Ortega informed, the US producer notes that it will take more time to meet the renewal plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, a new president of GM Europe, is trying to make every plan point first agree with the side concerned.
As a result, the final document, which will be submitted first to employees and then to the governments of individual countries in which the production races are headed, will be issued at the beginning of 2010.
On the contrary, GM ensures that Saab Saab's sales decision should be adopted in these days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the US producer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wishes to obtain Volvo, but considers the possibility of the Dutch producer of Skyper sports vehicles that operates under the protection of the Russian Converg Group.
In case it is not possible to agree with any of them, GM could sell certain assets of the Saab of the Chinese Baic.
It continues to be decided to close Saab in the end of the year unless its sale is succeeded.
Drive with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In the development of this brilliant model, the Porsche engineers used Boxster S as a base and managed to reduce weight by 80 kg, thus showing only 1.275 kg.
Aluminium doors such as GT3, which means another 15 kg less; air-conditioning 13; reduced fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters also contributed to weight reduction by 7 kg; after mounting the sports seats of another 12 kg, thanks to the 19-palc wheels further five kilograms.
And eventually, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less and the replacement of door traps with textile traps means another kilogram.
It is also offered with a two-level PDK transmission, one vehicle was tested with a hand-red six-step speedbox, mainly on the roads of the second class in California, on the mountain segments with many complicated scrolls.
His behaviour can only be qualified as intact.
The weight reduction does not mean that the asphalt vehicle is not printed.
On the contrary, we haven't tested a small and light model for a long time, which would also carry such security at the turning, even at high speeds.
It's a small athlete able to warm the muscles at a short ride for the time needed until we order him sprint, brake, and renew the use of the engine...
Anything we want, thanks to the control that's as communicative as precise, whatever we show hands on the wheel is what the car does.
And it'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound by will
The V6 boxer sound, with 320 horses (at 10 more than Boxster S) is a very gift and can be strengthened by the option 'sport' and through the system that modifies the engine sound that has already been used in Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is violent, whether or not sucking or recovering.
The curtains are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asfalt roads we're driving with Boxster Spyder was pretty ruined, but the car managed well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride, and in some turns we struggled at the dawn of the frozenness and puzzle even in the advanced morning.
Definitely this ultra-free car is one of the most fun in the market, because it is more than just a Boxster Modification S.
The car will be included in the sale in February 2010 at the price of 70.831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Girl Karla Lagerfelda, the icon of the Coco Cocoon series and the occasional 'starlette' on the shows 'company', the singer presents her face of the evil girl as vegetablely as her purse Chanel.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Basconia has won Israel’s victory
The work treasure was a brilliant victory in 82-91 at its hosting at the complicated Maccabi Electra field, despite many absences in Duska Ivanovice, and thus came to the head of its group after the great performance of the World of Teletovice, which with eight three-points was announced by the best in the company (29 ratings).
Vitoria has been able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertase or Mic's large dose of plantation and collective work, even though it had to suffer until the end to win.
Furthermore, a large accuracy from the circle with 16 triple points was a lot of participating in the final triumph.
The fight began with the face of the blues who stood on the mark from the beginning.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance, already suggested that they attacked the Israeli community very hardly.
English and Teletovic belonged to the main shooter 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alavian company decided for Barac's internal game and Eliyahu's work, which was adopted by screaming and applause when returning to its original activities to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to be the best in his company with 13 points, although'without six' at Splitter's assessment, it was already suggesting that this would not be the best evening for Brazilians.
But even though the game was sharp until the rest, it was not decided in the least, and the Makabeians wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone wins on their field, and 'Elias' had the power to win.
Eidson and Pnini have certainly contributed to returning the yellow (50-49).
More inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, injuries, but not dead at all, needed a few precise games to get a breath, and there appeared a bullet Mirza Teletovic, which was three-three almost after and with the help of English and Ribase returned the score to a calming number (54-67), which reached local at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alabas had the skin in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow someone to lose their deserved results for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their men, did not give up and try to keep the company alive from a line of three points (70-77).
Despite the fact that Splitter and the exclusive selvanovic, they did not impress and defend well, even though the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match had the winner andTel Aviv lost the first time in the season.
Injury prevents the Union from fighting
The Unition has lost significantly in Greece with Olympiacos and has left him the leadership of Group B in Eurolise in the fight, which was marked by three attacks by Unicai, but mainly the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
Malagy’s company did not have the environment of Pavillon peace and friendship or competitiveness, perhaps one of the sicker in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusans to dream. Aggressive defense and three three points, two thanks to Omar Cooku and one Guillem Rubia, brightened the field s12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaia , even though the arsenal of locals in the internal game with Bourousis, Uncle and Schortsanitsis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment the battle between USBeverley and Williams' resistance meant excluding both players.
The Greek company started working and showed its advantage in both zones where the absence of English beer due to injuries of Joele Freeland and three personal errors of Carlos Jimenez have burdened the Uniceja company
Between the internal players and the Lithuanian wing of Linas Kleizas, they increased the advantage of 44-32, a minute 19.
Impossible retaliation
The third part was very attacking by Olympiacos, who, despite losing by 19, showed the advantage and even managed to compare the difference from the Malez Malaga 66-48, a minute 27, which was shaken by the leadership of the group.
The union tried to overcome the absence and the last absence of the Scottish beer Robert Archibald, who was injured at the last match.
Despite all the unlikes of the Unica by the leadership and the three-point Cook and Lewis's contribution, she left a certain hope of the N victory 66-57, a minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because Olympiacos, thanks to strengthening and overcome in centimetrs in his zone, proved unstoppable.
The Croatian beer Nikola Vujcic, was able to solve the average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaya screwed up and passed the lead of Olympiacos.

Brazil set the date of Zelay's departure
The Brazilian government has established the time limit for Manuel Zelaya on its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The settled President must leave the diplomatic mission not later than 27 January 2010, when his mandate is officially completed.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d’affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in the Hondurasian capital, confirmed for TV Globo that "Mel" knows that it has to leave this date from the embassy where it is hiding since September 21st.
"He is aware that on 27 January, after his mandate is complete, he must leave and seek another shelter."
The station also quoted a former state who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the protection of the Brazilian government," Zelaya telephoned.
After the elections on 29 November (when Porfirio Lobo was elected) Zelaya assured that he remained on the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually broke because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum which the government tried to put him on "de facto", which is President of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After the days of wine and roses since the last spring, when the inflation of assets represented the prevailing mood on the markets, there has been again uncertainty on the markets, which should not be surprised, because it is already a natural state in the environment where the actors make decisions about the future that is uncertain about themselves.
The medicinal product used by the Central Market Stabilisation Banks was a direct purchase of assets and indirect relief of liquidity in the nearer zero course so that financial institutions could buy assets for deduction.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been practically over, and without questioning their non-personal liquidity policy, they start throwing a little sand into the collision, as the Spanish Central Bank has done with its auction last year.
Therefore, investors question the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heteroxic measures, and we are participating in the return to the reduction of risk profits.
The movement of the bureau and the differences in communities have regained points, although they are still very distant to the unnormal levels that have reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize the private risk, which has again affected public debt.
Again the pressure on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany became a shelter of selected investors, which has expanded the diversification of the euro zone countries towards Germany.
Spain was almost affected by this unstableness, but at that time the Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the reduction in Spanish qualifications.
On the other hand, certain uncertainty is not useful for the silence of the moral risk players who have tried to re-embark the conscience of the people responsible for the world's economic policy in order to prevent destructive consequences of the restriction of employment loans, when the new day of thanks is in fact needed.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a tribal fight between emirates for renewal of power in emirates, and as to Greece, we have seen it before.
The government that covers deficits, elections and the new government is coming.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berluscon and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barros.
It does not make sense that Ecofin save Hungary from non-compliance with foreign payments at the beginning of the year and that it allows the euro member countries not to fulfil its obligations.
But what makes sense is that Ecofin forces the Greek government to transparency and the commitment of its own citizens to joint responsibility for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If we are expected to be before the period of normalisation of the premiums from the transitional risk, after some excess in supported positions would be within the expectation.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt differences will increase as well as the debts of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If the European differences decrease and ours continue to expand, it would be a typically Spanish risk.
The importance of Standard & Poor's is only an anecdote. When our front indicators force most of the studies to take up their renewable scripts and revise their raise scenario for 2011, including OCDE and the European Commission to return to the Japanese scenario, it is not aware of the great hope of experienced the fulfilment of this warning.
Again, it looks like it's a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for now, "cautionally, friend of driver."

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sanchez Galan first intervened yesterday before the subcommission of the Parliament, where the energy strategy of Spain is discussed in the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by the presentation of President Gas Natural-Fenos, Rafael Villasecy, Galan made several notes on the proposal submitted to the subcommission behind the closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of 50,000 million euros by 2020 and another 600,000 million from this date until 2030, if nuclear power plants are currently in operation.
If not, there will be no need for investments of 60,000 million, but up to 95.000 million.
Iberdrola really believes that in the next decade investments must be focused not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international connections.
Since 2020, the issue is changing and will need to increase its performance.
Its offer focuses on gas and carbon power plants with carbon capture mechanisms and, in particular, on renewable energy.
In this case, he believes that new 18,000 MWs are needed, however, with other "sustainable energy".
Galan, who believes that a woman of the Sustainable Economy Act, which the government has just approved, corresponds to the line that the company has requested, did not want to release a vial as a royal decree to support the consumption of national coal that opposes the policy of fighting climate change.
In his opinion, "the clear long-term bet" is in this sense, despite the "accuracy" of the measures called President Iberdrola.
Whatever it is, Galan believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must be accepted now, because their maturity lasts and is necessary a stable tax framework for their start.
Ferrovial won 'handling' Aer Lingus at ten airports
The daughter Ferrovial for airport services, Swiss Swissport, will play the role of the preferential partner of the Irish Airlines Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels belongs to the most important of them.
The agreement, from which economic terms have not yet been made, has been valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Kastilie-La Mancha and the University of Alcala de Henares signed yesterday a protocol on cooperation on the creation of the Centre for Intelligent Innovation Infrastructure
The Association assumes the investment of 20 million by 2012, 50% of which appears to be Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be research on energy efficiency on roads and airports.
Acciona seeks its first road in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
The Acciona fights for its first concession on the road in Australia, which is a market where it already works as an energy and aquatic business.
The building this is a tunnel estimated at $1,700 million (approximately EUR 1.047 million).
Her rivals are the French Bouygues and German Hochtief.
The tunnel long 5 km in the Australian city of Brisbane on the eastern coast became the closest possibility for the seActiona to settle in this country as a construction and concession road business.
The Council wishes to have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After selecting public and private cooperation (PPP according to the English initiative) for further development of the project in the trading plan protected by Erns & Young, the administration has already a final list of candidates for the construction and operation of the property.
The offers are expected to be presented in May in May, and the estimated investment will reach $1,700 million of Australian dollars (EUR 1.047 million) and in the last stage of the three concerts with a significant presence in European buildings.
A group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies, and the second with the headquarters in Italy is one of the biggest European specialists in the underground buildings.
The Acciona group is in the Northern Direct game with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French Buygues construction group.
The third and last concert that passed through the network is the name of LBRJV and is part of the Australian capital Leighton (the daughter of the company of the German Building Company Hochtief, here represented by ACS), also the local Baulderstone (Germany Group ownership Bilfinger Berger) and a significant company specialized for the Civil Buildings of Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large buildings and privatisation, but it brings a clear difficulty in entering in other ways than medium-sized acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy followed by the Hochtief or Bilfinger is still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector, except the Asian references.
ACS has received a market position through its 30 % share in Hochtief, the owner of the quoted Leighton.
Million assets
The Acciona is betting on the geographical area with the greatest importance for the sector, where it has already a significant presence through its energy supplier activities and in the salt trade.
In addition to other assets, the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and leads a group of businesses that build and manage the Adelaide dissolving facilities with the budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and to use common energy to enter the areas of construction and infrastructure operation.
The underground road subject to the mith, whose promotor is the Brisbane City infrastructure Office, called Northern Link (North Link), has to connect the Western road from Toowong with the district route in Kelvin Grove (see map) at 5 km of the tunnel. It is the biggest action to reduce the transport burden of Brisbane.
The calendar established by the local administration plans the entry for the summer 2010 and starts work for December next year.
Although this payment passage would be opened in the last months of 2014, the complete completion of the work is planned until 2016.
The tunnel started designing in 2005.
It will contain two streams in each direction, an electronic mite and complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland will provide $500 million (308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offered this procurement Hochtief
Australia still brings a significant profit because she announced a contract with the government estimated for 154 million yesterday.
Partial ACS will operate through its local branches Leighton infrastructure of the national network of a wide zone with a cable from the optical fibre.
This situation will allow a rapid internet access for 400 000 people and will provide the German company's work for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the tower building project King George on 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Building work was only about to start and Hochtief closed sales for 129 million.
In Britain, specifically in Manchester, will participate with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC was allocated to a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
By means of its Alpine branch, the FCC received the accommodation of a tunnel at a length of 2.1 km for a highway in Slovenia at a value of 64.5 million euros.
The company won a contract for several days after the work to expand the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
This way, Alpine strengthens its experience in building tunnels.
The start of work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and the time limit for implementation is 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore got a Renfe advertisement
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services to Sra. Rushmore for approximately three million euros per year, informed the railway company.
The Treaty contains a 12-month extension every year. Sr. Rushmore was chosen among 16 agencies who were represented in the Renfe competition, from which four of them entered the final, including TBWA , which was responsible for the creation of advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will take care of the proposals and campaign production.
Penalty 63 million proFrance Télécom for braking competition
The regulatory authority for competition in France has imposed a penalty of 63 million euros of lFrance Télécom for counter-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited the competition of firm and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programmes with the consumer on the border of the regulation.
This sanction, a former French monopoly and still acquired more than 560 million euros since 1994 for impeding its competitors.
The penalty stored yesterday de facto has been raised because the competitive authority believes that France Télécom has committed a similar offence as in the past, and therefore has been renewable.
Sales of applications
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened online applications to increase revenues that will not come from voice transfers.
From the beginning, Orange's applications will be active in France and Great Britain.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries like Spain.
Playing in the Champions League brought from the beginning 476,4 million Madrid and Barçe
The League of Masters has become a source of income for these clubs since its origin in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476,4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth most profit club in the competition.
The paper leads Manchester United.
The paper leads Manchester United.
Wining the League of Masters of EUFA is not just a glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue for big clubs.
Until that the competition divided 5.362,5 million euros between 105 companies (of which 12 Spanish), which participated from the beginning of the 1992/1993 tournament, according to the EUFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have gotten very well out of this section.
The White Club was the third on the continent with the most money he gained for participation, and the only one with AC Milan, who won the main price three times.
The Catalan contemporary champion and the last winner of the missing European cup in 1992 is in the fifth classification.
The list leads the Manchester United and the monk Bayern, two companies who also charged the biggest money for the participation in the last Liaison of Masters.
And yet, she's both lost with Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is a third country that has obtained the most money through the Champions, although it has obtained the most titles of all (fifth against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This seeming paradox is explained by a complex procedure in the distribution of money used by EUFA.
For this accounting year, the authority President Michel Platini plans to earn 1,090 million for Champions League.
From these money, EUFA dedicates 413,1 million for solid payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in the preliminary classification circle (except athletico Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Furthermore, those who have achieved their participation received 3.8 million for their presence only, with the exception of another EUR 550,000 for each match that they participate.
There is also a victory premium (800,000 euros) and a remisis (400,000 for each company). Osmifinalists get three million each; eight quarterfinalists 3,3 million.
Each of the last four gets four million.
The champion makes nine million, while the second finalist is 5.2 million.
This is how the club earns at least 7.1 million and at least 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning in the European SuperCup in August.
Furthermore, there are moving payments for which 337.8 million are intended.
These money shall be shared according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main places and has four seats.
Last year the champion gets 40% of the money allocated, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% Sos
The Nuev Rumas group published yesterday the details of the purchase of shares with which it wants to obtain a top place between 25% and 29.9% of the Sos capital.
This percentage does not oblige the public offer for the acquisition (optional) of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 for a share that would be paid in ten years and would pay the interest for this discount1% a year.
Yesterday the Sos shares finished trade at EUR 1.85; therefore Nueva Rumasa offers a company by 18% below the market value.
According to Nuev Rumas, price 1,50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is provided for by appointing eight of 15 members of the Council.
The Jerezian group shall provide a period of 15 days for shareholders to notify their interest in the sale of the share.
The CNMV declared that it was not informed of the offer, although Ruiz Mateose confirmed that it had connected to the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalisation of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, the sauce continues to change the structure of its leadership.
As an attempt to endure on the edge of possible offers for purchase and compensation for the judicial proceedings of his former leaders, Jesus brothers and Jaime Salazars, the election of Maria Luisa Jord was announced as the head of the internal audit.
This decision constitutes the first woman who has undertaken a high function in the food business.
It's a newly created place to be directly subjected to the president of the group.
And it is not excluded from the dispute, since the company is still underministered in the legal battle for the alleged movement of more than 230 million from the Sos company of the Salazar brothers.
De facto cannot be argued that the Sos will reveal new transfers of funds in the next months
As regards the credit of the Salazars, the former members of the Ildefonso Ortega Council and ANgel Fernandez Noriega (protecters of CCM and Unicaja) had yesterday confirmed that they approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV allows Paternina exclusion option that Inversor Mer participated
The National Commission for the Securities Market (CNMV) authorized yesterday the exclusion of the Inversor Mer, against Federicu Paterninovi on October 9.
The supervisory authority explained that it authorizes this operation because it understands that its conditions meet the applicable standards and considers it "sufficient" content of the explanation of the brochures submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the offer was aimed at acquiring 550.008 shares of Federica Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of the company's capital, which constitutes 6.142.786 shares accepted for trade in markets in Madrid and Bilbau.
Furthermore, he explained that 5,592.778 million shares were disfellowshiped, which would not be able to be transferred in no way until the offer was concluded, which indicated that the price was established by the Federice Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New vehicle assessment tools
In these days, storms and accidents don't only make car services.
Each day, thousands of cars that have suffered the insurance event are dragged to the service where an expert has to estimate damage and repair costs.
No insurance event is the same and the cost calculation of parts and the working time may be a long and complex work.
Calculate manual repair costs from 20,000 to 30,000 euros, including parts and working forces, may take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
That's why almost 100% of the experts use this type of system.
Suppliers of services and solutions for assessments of insurance events and maintenance shall be dedicated to the collection of information provided by the manufacturers to develop and offer a useful tool to their customers.
In Spain, Audatex, from the US group Solera is a leading company; 80% of the evaluation is carried out with its products.
Other companies that compete in the fields of assessment instruments and processing information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Velazquez, business director Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 producers and importers and each of them provides information in another format.
Furthermore, the quantity of data for processing continues to grow, since more versions, variants and engine solutions have been given in the past five years.
Once a new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start working.
It's a very hot job, because each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle must be catalogized and determined its price.
Furthermore, each model is performed with "intelligent" graphic processing", where it is possible to "pull" individual parts of tourist cars.
With regard to a model with massive sales, work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
With regard to a minority car, it may take three or four months. At present Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models that they have on the information belong Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of the park in the circulation, it exceeds 99%.
Audatex has eight centres divided around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each specializes in specific marks.
The national seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than 100 techniques (usually mechanical experts) working with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros a year in the production of these databases.
Every month, 2,5 million data are classified and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this enormous stream of information allows businesses to different uses and deliver different products.
The most common use is focused on repairs and maintenance, but, according to individual countries, there are also tools for the management of replacement parts or for the calculation of the sales value of the car.
The only company available to the guide to inform the value of the vehicles used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex is not offering them in our country, but in the United States, yes.
With regard to products offered by Audatex, it is easy to obtain the support that professionals can use in the sector.
This company offers ten different instruments, with a star product AudaPlus, a standard solution to the assessment of insurance events designed for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, the time to repair the manufacturer or the quantity.
This instrument shall apply according to the application for each assessment.
The highest price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it small, maximum 10 times a month.
Then every insurance that conducts thousands of estimates will negotiate its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow the complete identification of the vehicle and the device with which it came from the mounting line only on the basis of the first number of the trailer.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows vehicles to be removed with a total insurance event.
His statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, geodemographic analysis or detection of deviations according to marks or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many model marks have passed through the service due to the crash or how serious insurance events have suffered during a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company to develop this type of instruments.
Furthermore, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to works or prices and official time of manufacturer.
Gt Motive is the company of the Eins Group established in 1971 as a supplier of services and solutions to damage, crashes or maintenance of cars
Gt Guía assessment is its reference historic product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in services, 3.100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The volume of the turnover increased by 20% a year in the last three years and in 2008 it accounted for €10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization of the office installation in Paris began.
Audatex was created in Germany in 1966, and in 1979 she was tabbling in Spain.
According to the sources of the company, 62% of her brother originates in Europe and 38% in North and South America. She works with 900 insurance and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
The World Invoice Group of Soler (Audatex, Sidexa, Information ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company earns 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Soler Group was standing at the $1,000 million bureau and now its shares are estimated to be totally $2,400 million.
Since 2007 it has been catathed on the New York Bureau and is included in the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Internet auction of disrupted vehicles
Last October, Soler's group bought Autoonline, the Internet database for sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after the insurance event.
The operation assumed the incorporation of 59.5 million euros from 85% of the company's capital that could be expanded next year by 15% remaining.
The goal of the purchase was to provide more services with added value to customers with the possibility of access to the huge international market.
This assessment and purchase and sale service is guaranteed exclusively to professionals in the sector such as insurance, experts, borrowers, services, sales of replacement works and professional sellers who must be registered before the start of operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and managed more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey arrives among the main markets.
The Web currently has more than 1.500 registered sellers and 4.000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and at the Spanish market approximately 100 new advertisings are added every day.
According to the Spanish law, the vehicle whose vehicle number has been deleted cannot be returned to operation but may be used as a source of replacement parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historical value may have authorised operation, although they were dismissed, after preliminary procedure.
Budget of the service in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Auda-Taller Audatex guarantees that the user gets the budget only in four steps: identification of the vehicle, searching for a replacement part, creating a budget and budget generation.
The ease of use is a crucial condition for these systems, particularly for the persuasion of professionals of a higher age, who are delayed in the use of new management techniques.
The database contains 1.034 vehicles, of which tourist 666, 109 territorials, 137 motorcycles, 78 deliveries and 44 trucks.
Naturally, the Internet-connecting computer needs to be used.
After identifying the model to be repaired using the number of the cartridge, a real graphical display of the model will appear and then the required replacement part will be selected.
The user may include variables as the cost of work force, supplements or discounts, and then print and transfer to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a assessment tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference directory.
The main difference between both systems is that it is oriented on the service and does not include the estimates of working forces.
The costs for the use of this workshop tool are 350 euros per year which the customer can finance.
The Audatex is currently working on making this view three-dimensional.
This is the innovation they're welcomed by the mechanic because they're going to allow for example to choose a door and turn it over to show the inside side.
