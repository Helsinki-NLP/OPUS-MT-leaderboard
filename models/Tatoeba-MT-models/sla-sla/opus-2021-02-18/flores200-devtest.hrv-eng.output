Martelly swore yesterday to the temporary election council (CEP) consisting of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth temporary election council in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission referred the previous resignation of the CEP as part of the measuring package towards the new elections.
The credibility was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-reżym protests that started in October.
Sometimes the violent protests launched the absence of the elections that had to be held since 2011.

The FAA claims that the followingGen system would allow the reduction of flight routes and thus save millions of gallons of fuel annually and reduce carbon emissions.
In contrast to older technologies based on radars, this system uses satellite technology so that air traffic controllers can more accurately locate aircraft and give the pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport option will be organized, and the ground trains will not be stopped in Wembley. Also, vehicle parking facilities and parking and use of public transport to the ground level will not be available.
Because of fear of the lack of transport, there was a possibility that the game would have to move to prison without fans.
The study published on Thursday in Science reported the development of a new species of birds in the Ecuador Islands of Galapagos.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and the University of Uppsala in Sweden reported that new species have developed within only two generations, although the process was believed to last much longer, due to the crossing between the endemic Darwin's Zeb, Geospiza fortes and accompanied by zebs, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be formed in any form possible. It can be incorporated into small forms.
It can be dragged into a thin wire, which can be wrapped and plugged out. It can be knocked with a hammer or rolled into planes.
"It can be very thin and stick to another metal. It can be so thin that sometimes it is used to decorate manually painted pictures in books called "written manuscripts."
It's called a chemical pH. Your indicator can be a red cook juice.
Rasol changes the color depending on how much acid or basetic chemicals are.
The pH value shall be indicated with the quantity of hydrogen ion (H in a shorter pH) in tested chemical.
The hydrogen ions are protons without electrone (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electrone).
Mix two dry powders together, and then clean them with wet hands, press them into the ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with an external layer, and the reaction will scratch you and cause you to create a bowl.
In Harrappa and Mohendžu Daro, every house was equipped with at least one toilet with washing connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
The residues of sewering systems were found in mineau cities in Kreta and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. During Roman civilization, the toilets were sometimes part of public baths where both men and women were mixed in society.
When you call someone away for thousands of miles, you use a satellite.
The satellite in the universe receives a call, and then almost immediately reflects it back down.
Scientists in the universe use telescope because the Earth's atmosphere forms part of light and view.
To send satellite or telescope to the universe, a large missile is required to be high over 100 feet.
The collaborator brought unexpected changes to the world, and the biggest change was that the invention of a wheel has made us much easier and faster transport.
It enabled the invention of trains, cars and many other vehicles.
Underneath them are the medium-sized cats eating medium-sized grapes, from rabbits to antilope and deer.
Finally, many little cats (including house cats) eat a much more numerous small prey, such as insects, hungers, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is in the concept of decline, it is a special position that a cat takes, so he doesn't have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats living in large groups called stads.
The lion bowls consist of one to three relatively connected males and up to thirty females and young men.
The females are usually in a close family and make a big family of sisters and daughters.
Lion bowls act like wolf or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behaviour, and are also very deadly for their capture.
As a complete sportsman, tiger can climb (either not well), swim, skip a large distance and drag five times more force than man.
Tiger belongs to the same group (nature of panthers) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These are four cats the only ones they can say.
Rica tiger is not like the rice of all the voice of the lion, but more as a series of unreasonable, cried words.
The ocelots eat small animals, loving monkeys, snakes, hungers and birds, almost all the animals that are hunting is much less than they are.
Scientists believe that the ocelots follow and find animals eating by smell, smelling where the spell was moving on the ground.
They are very well seeing in the darkness through the night's vision and are moving very unseenly.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) separate from the main population from which they came (e.g. when crossing the mountain or river or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often be found in a different environment.
The new environment means different resources and different competition, so the new population needs features or adjustments that differ from the previous to compete for resources.
The original population has not changed at all; they still have to make the same adjustments as before.
During the time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it is increasingly less like another population.
In time, after thousands or even a million years, two populations will be so different in the appearance that they will not be able to be called the same kind.
This procedure is called a specialization, which means the design of new species. The specialization is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
The plants create oxygen that people breathe and then take carbon dioxide that people breathe.
The plants create food from sunlight through photosynthesis and also provide cover.
We make houses and clothes from plants, most of the foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals can't survive.
Mosasaur was the principal predator at his time so he was not afraid of anything but other mosasaurs.
His long jaw had more than 70 sharp teeth together with an additional set on the neck, which means there was no help for anyone who found himself on his way.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a grown language, and his food consisted of turtles, large fish and other mosasaurs, and maybe there was a cannibal.
He attacked everything that would enter the water; even the big dinosaurs like T. Rex would not be equal to him.
Although most of their food would be familiar with us, the Romans had a number of unusual or unusual delicates that included wild pigs, pauns, slippers, and pots.
The other difference was that the poor and women had eaten on their chairs, while the rich men enjoyed the common feasts where they would be treated on the side.
The meals of ancient Romans could not contain ingredients arrived in Europe from America or Asia during the next centuries.
For example, they did not know corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no one in ancient Rome ever tasted turkeys.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered God’s house.
People offered sacrifices to gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of gods by comparing ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramids formed towers, called zigurates, which were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of God.
In warm climate conditions of the Middle East, the house was not that important.
Most of the lives of the Hebrew families took place in the open.
Women cooked in the yard; stores were open to the road. The stone was used to build houses.
There were no big forests in the country of Canaan, so the tree was extremely expensive.
Grenland was rarely inhabited. Norwegian sage tells him that Eric Red, after being expelled from Iceland for murder, on his way to the west, discovered Grenland and found that name.
Regardless of his discovery, there have already been Eskima tribes.
"Although every country was scandinaust," there is a lot of differences between men, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland."
If you were watching the film National Treasure, you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence there was a ticket with treasure.
Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a ticket with treasure.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence, there was "Original Declaration of Independence on July 4th, 1776." The text is at the bottom of the document, in the opposite."
No one sure knows who wrote this large document on the pergament (dimension 29⁄4 with 241⁄2 inches), but it is known that shortly after it was made, it was scratched for storage.
So it's probably just added as a tag.
The landings in the part of Day D and the fights followed were released from the north of France, but the south was still not free.
There were the French from Vishiev France, which were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked together with the conquers instead of fighting against them.
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked South France, the attack is known as "Smooth Operation."
In only two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces released Southern France and headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together – society.
The word of civilization comes from a Latin word of civilism, which means civilian, which refers to Latin Civis, which means a civic, and a civilian, which means a city or a city of State, which also defines the size of society in some way.
The civilized culture implies transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, trail in culture and equal spread.
Less cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence so we don't recognize them as real civilizations.
During the US Independence War, 13 states first established a weak central government consisting only of the Congress.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and since there was no State or judicial authority, he relied on the competent authorities that often did not cooperate.
He also had no power to cancel tax laws and customs laws between countries.
To amend the Treaty, it was necessary a single consent of all countries, and the Central Governments did not take it seriously, so their representatives were mostly absent.
The Italian football team, with German, was the second most successful team in the world, and they were champions at the World Football Championship of FIFA in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, basketball, waterpolo, swording, football, bike, hockey on ice, hockey hockey and Formula race 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions in which Italians compete in international games and olympic events.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (the largest is Honchu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
"Because it consists of the acquisition (group) of the island, Japan is often called "archipelag."
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when European sailors during the sailing along the island recorded the island's name as Ilha Formos, “a beautiful island”.
In 1624, the Netherlands eastern Indian company establishes a base in southern Taiwan and initiates transformation of aboriginal practices in the production of cereals and employs Chinese workers to work on rice plants and sugar trunks.
In 1683, Qing (1644 - 1912) has forced the management of the Taiwan Western and North Coast Area and Taiwan proclaims the province of the Qing Dynasty Empire 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Chinese-Japanese War (1894-1895) the Qing government signed the agreement in Shimonosecek, which gave Japan to the sovereignty of Taiwan that ruled it by 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: Intihuatana, Sun Temple and Room with three windows.
Most buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt in order to get tourists a better introduction of how they originally formed.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchua was renewed and renewed.
For example, the most common format of the photograph in the world is 35 mm, which was the main size of the film before the end of the era of analogue film.
It is also produced today, but more importantly, the same measure has the formats of the image sensor in digital cameras.
A little confusing the fact that the 35-millimeter format is actually a wide 36 mm and a height of 24 mm.
The amount of width and height of this format (sharing to twelve to get a measure shown in the whole numbers) is therefore 3 : 2.
Many default formats (e.g. formats from the APS group) are equal or nearest to this measure of width and height of the image.
The rule of a third that is often breached and ridiculed is a simple direction to create dynamicity with a certain retention of order in the picture.
It states that the most effective place for the main object on the season of lines that split the picture into thirds vertical and horizontal (see example).
During this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church became a subject of criticism.
Over a thousand years, Christianity has connected European countries with different languages and customs.
The strong power of Christendom has affected everything from the king to the pupils.
One of the principal Christian principles is that wealth should be applied in order to mitigate suffering and poverty reduction and that the funds of the church exist specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to ask if they follow this principle.
Shortly after the explosion of armed conflicts, Great Britain started the N-Jamac naval blockade.
The strategy acted because it prevented German access to vital military and civilian supplies, but the blockade violated a generally accepted international law coded in multiple international agreements during the past two centuries.
UK has minimised international waters to prevent ships from entering the entire oceans, which has also caused danger to neutral side ships.
Since there was no too much interest in this tactics, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine war.
In the 1920s, most citizens and people were overwhelmed by the pacifist attitude and separation.
After they experienced horror and beast during the I World War, the nations wanted to avoid that such situation would be repeated in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to accept the job at Edison's company in New York.
In the United States, he arrived with 4 cents in his poetry poetry, and a letter of recommendation that Charles Batchelor (the chief at his previous job) addressed Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of displaying different weather periods; every phase of China or any family that was able to do was a distinguished dynasty.
Between each dynastie, there was an unstable period of divided provinces, and the most famous of those periods was the era of the Trio of Kingdom, which lasted 60 years between Han and Jin.
During this period, rough wars were held among nobles in the fight for the throne.
Three kingdoms are one of the most bleeding times in ancient China history; thousands have died in battle for the greatest place in the great palace of Xi'an.
The consequences are the social and political character, such as the use of the metric system, the absolute movement to the Republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to the ruler.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, employment was available to all men, the most ambitious and the most successful ones were given a chance for success.
The same is true for the army because after the revolution the acts were gained on the basis of the ability, not the stairs.
The French revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to launch their own revolution.
"Muhammad was very interested in questions outside his boring life, a cave that became known as "Hira" in the mountain "Noor" (light) visited so that he could think better."
The cave that survived through history provides a clear picture of the spiritual values of Muhammad.
The cave is at the top of one of the mountains north of Meka and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not at all easy to find even if you know with certainty that it exists.
Nothing can be seen but a clean, beautiful sky and many nearby mountains. Very few of this world can be seen or heard from the cave.
The big pyramid in Giza is only one of the seven miracles that still exist.
Keops’ pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century before Christ, was one of the many large pyramid buildings built in honor of the dead Pharaoh.
"Vizoravan Giza or "Necropolis in Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is largest), several small graves, several temples and the Great Sfing."
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Kufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of the women of Pharaoh Kufu and his family.
"The marking ""goudale move up"" looks like "V" "gooding downwards"" like a connector or a square without the lower page."
The sign above means that you should start from the top and push the push, and the sign down means that you should start with the frog (which we hold with our hand) and pull the puzzle.
The elevated puzzle usually produces a softer sound, while the dropped squeezing is stronger and more imputable.
Please add your own tags, but remember that the tags for movement are printed for musical reasons, so they should usually be followed.
The scared King Louis XVI, Queen Mary Antoinet, their two children (11-year-old Marie Theresa and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister Elizabeth a bunch of women forced them to return from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a bunch of people who screamed and cried threats to the king and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and the Queen to keep the windows open.
At one point, a crowd in front of the horrible queen shoved the head of the royal guard killed in Versailles.
The US Imperialism War Expenditures in conquering Philippines were paid by the Philippians themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime in order to attach a large amount of costs, and interest rates changed through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the supercourse resulted from the long-term exploitation of the Philippines will create a basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the templars, we need to understand the context in which the order was created.
The period of these events is usually called a medium - century development, which is a period of European history during the 11th, 12th and 13th century (1000 - 1300 C.E.).
The Middle Ages developed was earlier in the Middle Ages, followed by a late medium-aged medium-term ended by about 1500 according to the convention.
Technological determination is the concept that includes a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological incentives or technological imperatives to strict understanding that human fate is guided by a fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most of the interpretation of technological determination shares two general ideas: that technology development itself follows a path that is largely above cultural or political influence and that technology also has "effects" on society that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
For example, the invention of cars is necessary to lead to road development.
However, the road network across the country is not worth only a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce car ownership costs.
The mass ownership of cars leads to a larger number of road accidents, leading to the discovery of new techniques in health care for injury.
In Romantism, there was a strong element of cultural determination from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography forms a individual, and with time the customs and cultures related to geographics that are in accordance with the physical population of society are better than randomly imposed laws.
As Paris is known as the capital city of modern mode, Costantinopol was considered the main city of the Faud Mode of Europe.
He was known as an epicenter of luxury from 400 C.E. to approximately 1100 C.E.
The status deteriorated in the twelveth century mostly because the Crossmen returned with silk and spices that had higher value than the bizant market.
At this time, the title of the capital of the fashion has been transferred from Constantinopol to Paris.
The top of the Gothic style was from the 10th to the 11th century and in the 14th century.
The dress was at first under strong influence of the bisant culture from the east.
However, due to slow communication, western styles remained behind 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Age, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the greatest discoveries of that period as a result of crusade wars was using clothing buttons.
The self-supplied agriculture is to produce sufficient food in order to meet the needs of agricultural and its/her family.
The self-supplied agriculture is a simple and often organic system that uses seeds of autochtone ecoregia in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques for maximum contribution.
In the past, most farmers were dealing with self-supplied agriculture, which is still worth many developing countries.
Subcultures unit the same thoughts who feel ignored by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic belongings, classes, locations and/or family members.
Qualities that make some subculture special can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or combination of factors.
The subcultural members often show their belongings to the familiar and symbolic use of style, including mode, manners and chargones.
One method of illustrating the importance of socialization is to give examples of accidents of children who have not been socialized during growing, either as a result of neglect, accident or deliberate abuse.
Such children are called uncultivated or wild; some wild children are captured by people (usually their own parents). In some cases, the child’s abandonment is the consequence of rejecting their parents that their child has severe intellectual or mental damage.
Wild children may experience severe abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or fled.
Others are suspected to be raised by animals, and some are allegedly living alone in wildlife.
If he was fully raised by animals, a wild child shows behaviour (in the body’s borders) that are almost completely similar to the behaviour of the animal that raised him, such as fear of people or indifference to humans.
Although learning on the project should facilitate learning and make it more interesting, the setup of a skeleton goes a step further.
The setting of scall, i.e. supporting (scaffolding) is not a educational method, but support for individuals in front of whom a new experience is learning, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The rocks can be virtual and real; in other words, the teacher is a shape of the skeleton, as well as an animated connector that appears in Microsoft Office programs.
Virtual setting of scales is interior in the software and is intended for examining, indicating and explaining procedures that may be a too big challenge for the student to solve them on his own.
Children are accommodated in a household system for various reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not motivating, caring and educational, but it is still happening.
We believe that the residence system is a safe zone for these children.
Our home care system is obliged to provide safe homes, caring careers, stable education and reliable health care.
Accommodation should satisfy all the needs that are missing in the home they have taken from.
The Internet combines the elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The recognised features of the Internet open additional dimensions in terms of use and access.
"For example, "training" and "socialization" are described as important motives for the use of the Internet (James and sur., 1995)."
"In a study of visitors' responses to web sites, Eigmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal engagement" and "continued relations" as new motivation aspects."
The application of the video recording has enabled important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, the movement of the faces that last several milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to identify whether a person lies with the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his presidency's speech, claims that people who can't understand speech due to brain injury still can exactly assess his honesty.
He said that even animals like home dogs have the ability to interpret human behaviour.
Studies in the twentieth century showed that there were two groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection is removed from the summary of expressions.
Segregation and recombinations in each generation transmit the variable between these two sources.
In the Savannah, the primates with a food system similar to humans are difficult to satisfy the need for aminoxislins from available plant sources.
In fact, failure has serious consequences: smaller growth, bad nutrition and eventually death.
The most accessible plant resources were the proteins of leaves and mahunarians, but the primatians such as us are difficult to make some of them.
On the contrary, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to eat, but contains large quantities of proteins containing all essenceal aminoxilines.
"When everything is taken into account, we should not be surprised that our ancestors have solved the input of proteins in almost the same way as the chimpanzees in the Savannah today."
Abortion of sleep is a process of deliberate awakening during the normal sleeping period and resuming to sleep something later (10 - 60 minutes).
It is possible by simply using a relatively quiet audience to come to consciousness without a full wake.
If you realize that you're turning out the wakehouse in your dream, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorithmic options include consumption of a lot of liquid (specifically water or tea, famous diuretic) before sleep, which makes you rise and wet.
The amount of internal peace the person owns in the opposite correlation with the amount of tension of her body and spirit.
The smaller tension, the positive the presence of life force, each has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can experience enlightenment, and the only thing that stands on our way to that goal is our own tension and negativeness.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it is extended by the Mahaian way of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, including Kundala's yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
Kundalini yoga stimulates the cundaline energy (inflammation energy) through yoga position, breathing exercises, mantri and visualization.
The divine yoga is in the centre of the Tibetan meditation. By visualization of various divines, energy channels are cleaned, activated chackers and creates consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in the World War II, which led to cooperation between the SSSR and the United States. After the war of the differences in systems, actions and cultures have led to enmity between the two countries.
Two years before the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and began the Cold War.
He should have lasted for the next 40 years and would be led to a truly authorized army in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense suffered a collapse, and the only hope was to withdraw and reconstruction along the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans failed almost over the night, when more than 800 000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered Poland and created a Belarus and Ukrainian front after invasion into the eastern Polish region, violating the Riga Peace Agreement, the Soviet-Polish Pact on Invasion and Other International Contracts, both bilateral and multilateral.
Good ship transport is certainly the most effective way in which a large number of people and a large quantity of goods can cross the ocean.
The navy's role was traditionally to ensure that your country maintains the possibility of moving people and goods, and simultaneously disables the possibility of enemy to move his people and goods.
One of the most recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, and the Americans tried to translate the people and material over the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy, who used most submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably be able to win Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
The goats were first attached to some 10,000 years ago in Zagros Mountains in Iran.
The ancient culture and tribes began to grow them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Pitomes were usually held in the flocks that wandered by hills and other sheeps, and they were protected by so - called goats, usually children or adolescents, which is the name for shepherds keeping the goats.
The cars that dragged the horses were built in England in the 16th century.
Although the first wooden railways for the wagons consisted only of parallelly compounded boards, they allowed horses that dragged a higher speed of movement and dragging a higher burden than it would be possible for something more garlic roads of that time.
The thresholds have been introduced very early to maintain the railways in place. However, it was gradually seen that railways could be more effective with iron on top.
This has become a common practice, but iron caused a greater exhaustion of wooden wheels.
In the end, the iron wheels replaced wood. The first fully iron railways were represented in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was walking, people started walking vertically two million years ago when Homo erectus (right man) appeared.
Their ancestors, the Australian, usually didn't walk right.
The bipedal walk appears in the australopics around 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, and it is possible that Sahelanthropus has been walking on two feet seven million years ago.
We can start living more in harmony with the environment, we can join the ecological movements, and we can even be activists to reduce some suffering in the future.
In many cases, it is like symptomatic treatment, but if we do not seek a solution that is only temporary, we must find the root of these problems and neutralize them.
It is obvious that the world has changed very much thanks to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems are increasing because of transplantation and extravagant lifestyle.
On July 4th, after Congress adopted a manuscript draft, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, he was then sent a few streets away in John Dunlap's printing.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies are now known as "Dunlap widesides".
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon, July 8, at the courtyard of the Indepenence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th.
25 Dunlap's copies that are known that there are still oldest copies of the document are saved. The source written by hand has not been saved.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and that lives still today, and we call them birds.
Many of them do not feel like dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many of the birds are like those dinosaurs.
They have shells and paws on their feet, lay their eggs and walk on two back legs like T-Rex.
Practically, all computers used today are based on handling information coded in the form of binary numbers.
The binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers or bits in the computer chargone.
Internal poisoning may not be obvious immediately. The symptoms such as vomiting are general enough to not be able to set a direct diagnosis.
Perhaps the best indication of internal poisoning is the presence of an open vessel with medicines or poisonous chemicals for household.
On the label, look for special instructions for the first aid relating to the poison.
The concept of bugs use entomologists in official sense for this group of insects.
This concept comes from well-known walls, insects that have very well adapted to human parasites.
Murder and ordinary walls depend on their hosts, in whose nests or apartments they live.
In the United States, about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, which is a leading neurologic disease in younger and medium - age people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system that is made of brain, back brain and optical nerve.
Studies have shown that women have twice as much prospects for multiple sclerosis than men.
A couple may conclude that the raise of newborns is not in their best interest or best interest in their child.
Such couples can give their child to adopt.
When adopting, biological parents deny their parents’ rights so that the other couple can raise a child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world functions by a scientific method, and this method is actually a directive for most scientific research.
In addition to this method, experimentation, or experiments that represent tests for elimination of one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and observation also direct scientific research.
Naturologists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotel's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, have been accepted.
As the knowledge of the Greeks fell down, the West broke links with Greek philosophy and scientific roots.
Many recorded rhythms in physiology and behaviour often depend on the presence of endogen cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, not only the response to external cyclic incentives, have been discovered in most living beings, including bacteria, mushrooms, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustainable oscilators that will continue the period of free cycles even if there are no external signs.
The experiment carried out by Hershey and Chase was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used fags, or viruses, to put their own DNA in the bacteria.
They performed two experiments that pointed to DNA in a phase with radioactive phosphorus or a protein fag with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have a lot of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the cells are hit by the germinative lines.
Only sexual mutations can be transferred to children, while other mutations may cause death of cells or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the plant and animal world.
Examples of activities in the location include hunting, fishing, photographing, observing birds, visiting parks and studying information on the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borne.
Every morning, people leave small cities and cars travel to work while they pass by those whose job destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport scenario, all have somehow connected to the transport system based on private cars and support it.
Science now states that this global carbon economy has expelled biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone's participating in society and using transport systems, and almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, there are rare complaints about water quality or bridge destruction.
Why are traffic systems caused by so many complaints; why are they thrown up daily? Are the engineers simply incapable? Or are they interfering with something much bigger?
The traffic flow is studying the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and interactions that they achieve each other.
Unfortunately, study of traffic flows is difficult because the conduct of the driver cannot be predicted with a rate of security.
Fortunately, drivers usually act relatively consistently, so traffic flows have a certain reasonable consistency and can be framed mathematically displayed.
For a better display of traffic flow, the links between three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help planning, designing and working on road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals that flew, and their flying ability made them easier to escape from the enemy and more effectively find food and pairs.
Most of the insects have that privilege to put their wings back along the body.
It allows them to hide more small places from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't swallow the wings of the villa cavalry and the watersweet.
Aristarh said a few thousand years ago that the sun system was turning around the sun.
Some believed that it was right, but many were convinced in the opposite - that the sun's system, including the sun (and even other stars), was turning around the Earth.
That seems reasonable because we don't feel the Earth's moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the longest and largest river on earth. It contains more than 8 times more water than the other largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river on earth, some six miles wide.
Even 20 percent of the water that is poured from the world rivers to the oceans comes from Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6387 km (3.980 miles), which is poured by water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone pyramids were built until the decline of the Old Kingdom, none of them exceeded the size and technical excellence of the pyramids in Giza.
The ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, who were then over a thousand years old.
The number of Vatican inhabitants is approximately 800.
Vatican uses Italian in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also a daily language used by most workers in the country, while Latin is often used in religious rituals.
All the citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People of ancient times know about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because everyone can be found in nature in the original form and is relatively simple to draw them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotel had the theory that everything was made of one or mixture more than four elements.
It was more than four aggregate states (the same order): cruel, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theoretized about changing into new substances to form themselves in what we see.
The logs are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There can also be legures containing small quantities of non-metal elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of material, the material makes small particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that the billions of them could stop at the end of this sentence.
The pen has thus become a close friend to a large number of people when it appears.
Unfortunately, with new writing methods, the pen has lost status and is used more rarely.
People are writing messages on computer screens today, so they don't need a blade.
We can only assume what happens to the keyboard when something new appears.
The physical bomb acts on the principle of taking energy for core compilation with numerous protons and neutrons.
It's about like pushing heavy wheels up the hill, and dividing the core re-releases the part of that energy.
Some atoms have irregular core, which means that they incite declines when pushing or without pushing.
The surface of the moon consists of rocks and dust.
The thickness of the core is about 70 km from nearer and 100 km away.
Tanji is in the sea area of the moon, and thicker in the area is visual.
On the nearest side, there could be more dark areas because the core is thin, and the lion has easily reached the surface.
Content theory are focused on finding what motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized with maturity and growing.
These theories consider what it motivates some people to want what they want and what they appear in the environment to do or not.
Two popular content theory are Maslowlov's hierarchy needs and Herzberg's theory of two factors.
"Usually speaking, two behaviours can come out in case the leaders start to run their former colleagues, and at one end of the spectrum, there are attempts to remain part of the team."
This type of leader faces difficulties in making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary measures, conducting evaluations, granting jurisdiction and calling for responsibility.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognized individual who thinks he has to change everything that the team has done so far and do according to his own.
The leader of the team eventually is the one responsible for his success or failure.
This behavior often leads to a mess between leaders and others.
Virtual teams should follow the same performance standards as conventional teams, but there are small differences.
The members of the virtual teams often represent the touch point of the closest physical group.
They are often more autonomous than classical team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which local administration may not understand.
"The presence of the real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, 109. page) is also a unique component of the virtual team."
The "Invisible Team" represents a team of leaderships which meets each member. The Invisible Team sets standards for each member.
The innovation is one of the objectives of putting organisational concepts of learning in practice.
After the effective consumption of all available resources in all functional departments of the organization, creativity and intelligence come to the expression.
As a result, the process of an organization that is trying to overcome the obstacle through collaboration can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the buyer.
Before the organization can become innovative, the leadership must create a culture of innovation and common knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) Continued approach explains as a method that organisations can achieve a higher level of efficiency.
Neurobeological data represent physical evidence of the theoretical approach to knowledge research, making the area of research more stringed and more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior confirms research of scientists.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rising of new technologies allows us to see and explore unseen brain structures and processes.
This gives us a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong scientific and fantastic connotation, it makes a very important branch of information science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of the machine.
The research of artificial intelligence includes the construction of machines for automation of tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and making schedules, replying to diagnosis and customers' issues and recognition of manuscripts, voices and faces.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real life’s problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now often used in the economy, medicine, construction and military because it is built in some software applications for home-based computers and video games.
The excursions are a significant part of each class. The teacher would often like to take her students to places for which the bus trip is not possible.
Technology offers a solution for virtual exhibitions. Students can look at exhibitions in the museum, visit aquarium or admire the beautiful art while sitting in class.
Virtual sharing of the trip is also a great way to think about the way and share experience with future classes.
For example, every year, Bennet school students in North Carolina design a web site on their journey to the capital city of the federal state, the page is changing every year, but old versions are stored online as a type of memorial.
Blogs can also improve student's writer skills. When they start leading the blog, students often mistake in grammatics and spell, but the presence of the audience in most cases correct it.
Since students are the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to seek to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Writing the blog also "compels students to become more inventory in the world around them." The need to encourage the audience's interest in inspiring them to be imaginative and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that promotes cooperation and encourages students to transfer learning outside traditional school.
"A suitable use of blogs" can motivate students to analytical and critical thinking; by active response to Internet materials, students can define their position in the context of foreign writings and express their own perspective on certain questions (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is a charming capital of Canada and offers a series of art galleries and museums that reflect the past and present Canada.
Something souther is located in Niagara's waterways, and the north is a home of untouched natural beauties in the region of Muskok and wider.
