Father Joseph Vitko: I saw Jesus in a white dress
He's a charismatic.
The sacred Mass for the release and healing of him, they pull out the crowds.
He was ten years old when things began to be unexplainable in his life.
Today, through French canyon, others experience this.
To be carried by the O. Sv. Mass for Liberation and Healing, the crowds are pulling away
He once came to his parents of a seven-month child who had a hole of 7.5 mm in his heart.
It was supposed to be operational.
Father Joseph Whitko prayed over him.
The same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for treatment.
The doctors were surprised to say: “Operation is not necessary, loss is only 1.5 mm. ”
My parents were crying for happiness.
After another prayer, the French hole disappeared completely.
The Creator began to experience spiritually unusual activities as a teenager.
In his dreams, purgatory souls came to him with a request for help.
I was waken at night and prayed for the dead and those who died at the moment, he remembers.
He also experienced the presence of the wicked spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits a mortal sin.
"My body began to change.
I lost human qualities and began to gather the animal's appearance," he said.
The invisible force took him up, and he couldn't get his voice out of himself.
He felt he was lost.
Then God showed him a salvation.
"After the waters of the river symbolising the holy baptism, I was released and returned to humanity..." he said.
He didn't tell anyone about these weird experiences.
He's grown up with a call.
He was 16 when he entered the French.
He did not only want to tell about Jesus in his preaching work.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the charismatic Community Renewed in the Holy Spirit
Vitko’s father’s healing missions are participating in many who count to get rid of the disease.
However, the spiritual emphasizes that their primary goal is spiritual healing, not fleshly.
First Failure of Culping FRAC Jaroslav
Today (September 26th) the afternoon team of Kolping FRAC deserved the current Polish Master Dartom Bogoria Mazovisk Građevic in the 3rd row of LOTTO Superliga of Table Tennis.
The Jaroslavians in such a personal set as they represented with the citizens, have no chance to win with the sovereigns of the League.
It was a victory struggle with Darth Bogoria.
The team still lacks the leader of the team, Chen Jingqi.
He may have been a third of the triumph in a new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han has probably not yet grown to win with tuzs such as Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most perspective Polish, or Mark Badowski.
Hellady's rival was the biggest star in the MOSIR Hall near Sikorsky Street in Jaroslavi.
The Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei were both the class for themselves.
After three singles, the Colping FRAC drove 2:1.
Kou Lei must have placed Mark Badowski, and Daniel Gorak after an emotional, fifty-set fight, Paul Siruck.
But then he was worse.
Gionis didn't give Lea a chance.
It could still be hoped to win for two points, but Qiyao Han did not match Badowski.
There will be no additional studies for seniors.
Why?
According to the predictions of Rafala Traskowski, a free preventive study programme for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not received the adoption of the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Tariфикation.
The agency justified that the target group was misconducted.
“The following actions may even affect the detection of individual sickness units, which may contribute to enhancing the difficulty in accessing NFZ deliveries and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with the falsely positive result of the research”, it wrote.
The resort decision doesn't understand the President of the capital.
"Money is ours, we have foreseen it.
The government is only afraid that if people are studying later, they will go to a doctor, which is absurd, because it's just about to lead to a situation where the prevention can be done faster.
All experts know that this helps with the burden of the health system, because it helps to quickly detect diseases and to effective health approaches.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand," said Rafaal Traskowski.
“I find it hard to imagine that running experts say, ‘ Let's not study, because there will be longer lines in the doctor, and if such experts advise the government, I'm not surprised that there is a health service in this state’s condition”, added the PO politician.
Palestine responds to Israel: We'll break up all the agreements so far
The Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas announced on Thursday at the General Assembly of the United Nations that it would break all agreements concluded with Israel if the future government of this country attempted to fulfil Benjamin Netanjah's prophecy on the availability of Palestinian land occupied.
"If the Israeli government will come up to fulfill this plan, we will dismiss all the signed agreements (by Israel) and withdraw from all commitments taken," he prophesied.
"We will reject the whole plan completely and completely," Abbas threatened with the pressure.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible measures -- not important what the consequences will be -- to engage fully in the application of international law and to fight terrorism," said the President of the Palestinian Autonomy, who had already made similar declarations in July.
Netanjah, the Israeli so far Prime Minister, after the 17 September elections, re-earned the government mission.
A week before the elections, he prophesied that if he wins them, he will announce the inventory of the Jordan Valley and intends to include all Jewish settlements across the West Bank.
In the early 1990s, Israel and Palestinians, who were then led by Jaser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements which were patronised by the United States.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised during the General Assembly of the United Nations to carry out the Palestinian general elections on the ground.
The last thing happened in 2006.
"When I return to the country, I call in the West Coast, in the Gaza Area and East Jerusalem local elections and all those who object to them will have to answer their actions before God and the international community," stated the Palestinian President.
Abbas also defended in his talk of Palestine's rights, treated as a permanent observer in the United Nations, to use the powers of the “complete members of the United Nations and all its bodies and institutions”.
The Palestinian leader finished the talk by calling to the international community to “force Israel to fill with full respect for the provisions of the United Nations. ”
The Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbass’ speech, saying that the Palestinian leader “will focus on the efforts of the United Nations toward the Palestinian Autonomy against Israel rather than to fight the calls for terrorism in Autonomy under his leadership. ”
Danon, however, noted by the agencies, did not refer to Netanjahu's surveys of occupied Palestinian lands.

The police pressed her to sign the statement that her husband was sick and died as a result of “happy accident. ”
105 million bad for video games industry companies from the National Research and Development Centre
Almost 105 million of the gross subfinances will come to gaming industry companies creating innovative solutions.
The National Research and Development Centre announced the results of GameINN III edition on Friday.
Almost 30 projects supported by the NCBR have been developed by a platform for the creation of field games based on the AR engine of the real world, together with a application to send data through users; a test-training platform for the verification of practical skills on the jobs and professional improvements using VR and AI technology; an innovative game simulating the management of real production processes using the new model of the game based on the virtual world's interaction with the real world, using the idea of industry 4.0 is given in the communication of the NCBR sent on Friday PAP.
The aim of the GameINN sectoral programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish videos sector in the global market by 2023.
According to the NCB, today the Polish video games sector grows 10% a year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video market in 2016 amounted to 1,85 billion zles, and the forecast for 2019 is 2.23 billion.
“Specifically prepared GameINN research agenda and already reaching 300 million evil support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme are an important impulse for further, dynamic growth in the Polish gamedevu”, the communication reads.
The videoscape is an excellent example of the effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
“The Government's incentives for innovation of entrepreneurs, such as B+R reliefs, improvements in competence, IP box or support programmes carried out by the NCBR, drive innovative businesses and allow them to more effectively compete in the very competitive market”, the Vice-Premier, Minister of Science and Training of Higher Jaroslav Gowin, quoted in communication, estimates.
The Chief of the Science Resort notes that the money for innovation does not only reach innovators in the form of project financing, but also remains in their pockets – the relief on B+R in 2018 has benefited three quarters of more entrepreneurs than a year earlier.
“The amount of the estimated cost for the B+R activities amounted to 1.7 billion of evils, resulting in over 300 million savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCB in the three GameINN editions," stressed Vice-Premier.
The NCBR Director Dr. Wojciech Kamenietski recalls that in the previous two competences with a total value of over 211,2 million of evils, 78 new projects were granted.
A huge interest in the III competition and the diversity of the proposals show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to continue to develop and increase its competitive advantages.
“Especially pleased the fact that, as in previous editions, there are projects on solutions not only for entertainment but also related to the industry 4.0”, he adds.
In the third GameINN competition, even 20 million of evils could have been incurred by entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs' consolidation and consolidation of businessmen with scientific units.
In the NCB, 87 applications have been applied to the total amount of approximately 317 million of Zlo.
The competitive budget at the time of the announcement of the competition was 100 million of bad, but it was increased, and 27 projects were granted nearly 105 million zles of financing.
Detailed information on the results of the III GameINN competition is available on ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sector programme is implemented under the Operational Programme Intelligent Development.
The NCBR launched the programme in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Game Agreement, including CD Project, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team or 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confessed to stealing Casper Dolberg's watch.
The event took place on September 16th.
Dolberg, who at the end of August arrived from Ajaks Amsterdam to Nicea, realized after training that his watch disappeared from his clothing.
Not exactly, because it's worth 70,000 euros.
The angry Danish next day did not appear at classes, explaining stomach problems.
It was a mystery thing from the beginning.
The ball players in the dress have private safes, and the club area is monitored.
According to the AFP, Diaby-Fadiga finally confessed.
The 18-year-old apologize to Dolberg and other colleagues from the team and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised the Danish to pay the money for the clock.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most perspective footballers of the young generation in France.
He arrived in Nicea as a 13 - year - old man to debut in the first team three years later.
In this season, he showed up in seven games.
He recently signed a professional contract, but, as the newspaper L'Equipe said, the club will probably solve it with the immediate effect.
For now, he has set up a disciplinary procedure against his rival.
Nice, at least officially, refuses comments on this matter.
See if you're sure you're washing your hands
We all know that they need to be washed (e.g. after coming home or before eating).
But not everyone knows that if you really want to get rid of the diseases, you have to do it the right way.
This is important especially now when the autumn infections are coming.
It takes at least 30 to 40 seconds to remove enough dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands
But most of us wash them shorter!
Hot enough water and plain soap – it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even advise them).
By washing, we swim not only the bottoms and the tops of our hands, but also: the ends of the fingers (connected or single) – rub them with collist movements in the inside of the second hand, the space between your fingers (pay your hands, shaving your fingers), the fingers – we cover each finger with the second hand, and in that arm we turn it a little bit to the right and left.
In an emergency situation (when you can't wash your hands) we should wipe your hands with a wet glove and then use the antibacterial steel (in roads, from 5 bad).
After using the public toilet, don't touch washed hands of locks or doors (the Main Sanitary Inspector Recommendation).
Open them through the paper towel.
The President of Iran said he rejected the proposal to talk to the U.S., Donald Trump denies
The Teheran did not interview the US party during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the offer of the Americans to withdraw sanctions, the President of Iran Hasan Rowhani announced on Friday.
The President of the United States Donald Trump commented that the Iranian site asked for removal of the restriction, which he disagreed with.
According to the President of Iran, Hassan Rowhani, the Americans suggested that all the sanctions imposed on Teheran will be withdrawn in exchange for negotiations on the new international agreement.
It should regulate both the Iranian nuclear programme and the Balistic Building Programme.
Rowhani: Iran won't make conversations in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The President of Iran stated that he did not agree to take these conversations because of the “toxic atmosphere. ”
He stated that he met with American diplomats because he was in favour of France, Germany, and Great Britain.
However, he emphasized that Iran would not make conversations in the atmosphere of “maximum pressure. ”
"And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in format 5+1, no one can predict what the final outcome will be," Rowhani said.
A day earlier, the Iranian leader said he did not exclude the US talks, and the European nuclear contract parties rejected the acceptance of US sanctions against Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the U.S. accommodation of the nuclear agreement are “the preliminary condition that does not allow” to establish a dialogue.
If we can endure this preliminary condition and if America endures sanctions and the maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America – he declared.
He added that he did not exclude a meeting with the President of the United States Donald Trump, although he did not agree on such a weekly conversation during the United Nations General Assembly.
Trump: "Iran asked, I said no."
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he rejected the Iranian page.
"Iran wanted me to endure the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course, I said no!", tweeted the President of the United States.
Atomic agreement tension in the background
France, Germany and Great Britain are trying to reduce the tension between Washington and Teheran to save the agreement with Iran of 2015, which was signatories.
It stated that, in exchange for the removal of Iran's economic sanctions, it would quit the nuclear weapons construction programme and the nuclear sector will be under control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAEA).
Since the US was withdrawn from the May 2015 agreement, its signatories confirmed that they wanted to maintain an agreement.
None of it's done for now.
Washington uses the maximum pressure tactics on Iran and sanctions include full embargo on Iranian oil.
Teheran foretold that if he does not receive the export licence of the raw material, he will limit his obligations as a result of the agreement every 60 days.

The military judge of the Warsaw Administrative Court and the husband of Emilia, who, according to her words and screens from WhatsAppa, participated in prosecution against judges, was restored to the NSA on Wednesday.
The reason: no disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against him, and there is therefore no reason to support the WSA President Vojciech Mazur's order to dismiss it from his obligations.
The judge of Chromic Jerze, a disciplinary prosecutor at the NSA, introduced an explanatory proceedings to Smidt at the end of August, but it has not converted to him until now.
Although NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must take care of the decision of the President of the WSA within a month of its publication.
In this situation, the judge, who publicly told his wife's mental problems to discredit her, which was removed from the KRS office, will be judged and sentenced on behalf of the Polish Republic.
Judge Schmidt denies his share in the heater group.
He claims that there is no evidence of this except for fake screens and words of his wife, which is divorced.
Exactly the same claim are the other judges associated with the Castle: they are all innocent, there are no evidence.
And it's quite possible they're putting on their own.
Because the prosecutor didn't squeeze his finger to secure evidence from their electronic carriers, he also silented about the contents of Emilia Schmidt's phone, who stopped this phone in June in a different case.
The police didn't sneeze their fingers to secure the devices of the persecutors he indicated in February's report, Judge Waldemar Žurek.
There's no evidence - there's no case of Schmidt, there's no Casty case.
There's also no problem with the boss of NIK, Marian Banasia, renting stone to suitcase and hiding income.
CBA is checking its property statements.
And he'll see when he'll check.
The Commission of the Ambassador's Ethics will not take care of Banas because the Seim is suspended (but the Commission of State Control has somehow gathered to make a curious decision to appeal to the Deputies of Banasia and to call as a lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).
It reminds me of a film novel, an American, about the way my wife comes home and she gets her husband and a lover in bed.
She's so surprised and crushed that she can't cross the words.
She's standing in the door of the hemisphere, and at that time a lover jumps out of bed, dresses and leaves.
And the husband is shaving a bed.
When the wife gets her voice back and shouts, what is it?
Who's this woman?
Your husband asks calmly, what woman, honey?
Except for Casty or Banasia, the parody of the country.
And that's not funny.

Moravecki Cornel is in a severe state of hospital
He got to the hospital, and his doctors define his condition as hard.
It must be added that he's conscious and conscious.
"We believe it will come out, and it will win again.
We all pray to recover," said an anonymous close person of Cornell Moravecki in conversation with the journalists of the Super Express.
In the coming election, the prime minister's father candidate to the Senate.
"The nearest family and politics keep me alive," Cornel Moravecki said in an intelligence that he gave to the "Super Express" journalists two weeks ago.
In January, "Super Express" informed that 78-year-old Cornell Moravecki had been tested at the War Hospital in Wroclavia.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms, and I applied to the hospital.
Turns out I've got a yellow.
But the worst thing was before me.
When a computer томograf study was conducted, it was found that I had a cancer of a turkey...", the prime minister's father handed over.
A few days later, the MSWA hospital in Warsaw Cornel Moravecki passed a serious operation.
As Moravecki told, President Andrej Duda sent his private priest Priest Zbignjev Kras to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and went successfully.
“I know that many people prayed for me, and thank you very much.
Fortunately, I don't have any leverages.
I don't know if I'm going to go through chemotherapy yet.
I'm giving myself to the doctors of specialists who are rather good thoughts.
For now, after this hard operation, I have to get back to some state of use.
I hope everything will be okay," said Cornel Moravecki in January in a conversation with "SE".
"If I had surrendered too late, the situation would be tragic and I'd say good-bye to the devil..."
Krakov: 14-year-old missing

Anyone who has any information about the missing is asked for contact.
The missing 26 September night she left the place of residence, and until now she has not returned or had no contact with her loved ones.
She was last visited at the old Guest Street in Krakow.

When she was last seen, she was dressed in a blouse, gray pants and shoes.
Anyone who has any missing information is requested to contact the police under telephone 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
The power of swimming jumps.
The title of the amateur sports competitions played on Sunday afternoon on the hypodrome at Oleandra Street in Olawa, may be mistaken for some.
The road is far away to the real power, but that is the name which is one of the types of horse rivalization...
The jumping contest is to overcome the rider and horse’s increasing obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.
It is worth adding that a long and still unbeaten world record established in 1949 by Chilian Albert Larraguibel, on the horse of Huaso, is 247 cm.
So high in Olawa, of course, no one jumped, but the result of the best local Amazons at 135 cm is also not the worst...
Contests organized by the unanimous John Sienkewich and other JKS actors “In the siedle” were a showing part of the “Trust riding competitions ” that we write wider in this newspaper number, on page 22.
Eight Amazonians who trained in the Slovak JKS were competitive.
Four competitives competited the bitches and four on big horses.
In the first group, Nicolas Soldra was the best one in the world, who was sitting with the crazy Sprinter.
This small, but how a dynamic rumac began with the overcoming obstacles of 40 cm, and ended only at the top statian with the upper beam distanced from the earth by 125 cm.
However, he did not easily surrender and only after three further refusals, the jury had been dismissed from further competition.
The second place in the poppy jumps was Amelia Pawlak, who was sitting in the "Fami", and the third Lena Borun in "Harmider".
An ambitious fight was the youngest participant in the tournament - Inga Axman, screaming and jumping through obstacles to a small carmen clap.
Even more emotions accompanied the running Amazons and the viewers during the competition with large horses.
The dangerous declines included Paulina Szewczyk, who was sitting in the “Declarations” and Anastasia Abramenko, who was on the "Boatce".
Fortunately, there was nothing wrong with the Amazons and the horses, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with the introduction of the young Wineta in the parking lot had the Veronica Luckyevic.
It needed either a coach assist, or another horse to a pair that was a little crazy Wineta.
After the parking obstacle, she also went down with full strength, so in times in boxes and at the discharge, it became dangerous. “All is under control!”, calmed John Sienkiewich some of these frightened viewers, especially those youngest.
From the beginning of the big horses' competition, Martha Masalska was very well recorded in the parking lot, a beautiful "Whiskey" presenting.
This decent clutch, in a couple with a experienced Amazon, followed the second approach in the final phase as the first jumped 135 cm and it was the best result of the competition at the moment.
However, after a moment, the same height was included in the “Declaration”, Veronica Lučkoevič at “Vinete” and Anastasia Abramenko on the “Lotce”.
The flo decoration and after receiving the awards in the form of riding equipment, all these rivals went out together, and eventually together with Amazons on pounds in the Radecki march, they made an effective honour round, ending with these interesting and emotional competitions.
Thank you
The Sport Club “In Siodle” thanks the sponsors of the jumping power contest during the 16th “Trust Training Facility”: the City's Office in Olawa, the Facility for Water Trailers and Canalisation in Olova, the Civil Administration and the Mustang.
Max Kolonko is cut off from KWW Patriotical Revolution Max Kolonko
KWW Patriotical Revolution Max Kolonko is the name of the election committee under which the political formation #R Revolution of the Major Max Kolonka was to go to October's parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal especially to the young voters on the right views.
Before the Colonko elections, he foretold collaboration with Mark Jacob, or Paul Kukiz, but none of these coalitions had occurred, and the KWW Patriotical Revolution of Max Kolonko could not even collect enough signatures to put the lists in any electoral circle in Poland.
Now Colonko informed on Twitter that he had completed collaboration with the KWW Patriotical Revolution of Max Kolonko.
"I will expect my name to be deleted from the KWW.
Please disconnect my person with the in/in the named entity," he added and foretold that more information will be provided soon.
For now, it is not known whether the journalist will continue his action, whether it is the end of formation #R Revolution.
On July 4th, at the American Day of Independence, a journalist in the United States Maari Max Kolonko informed the creation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Colonko has been familiar with the leading of the YouTube channel Max TV, which comments on events in Poland and in the world.
"We have plenty of politics, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities in the country to take over the nation and rule for the benefit of the people," said Kolonko then.
In the party's programme, there were, inter alia, issues concerning judiciality (including the general elections), tax changes (examination of the amount of taxation for all), military reparations (in the form of military assistance for the Eastern NATO flag, with special in mind of Poland), the conduct of a referendum on the possession of weapons, the limitation of the number of Members or the introduction of the single election circuits.
A few days after the announcement of the new political formation, Major Max Kolonko joined Marc Jacob.
At the end of July, Kolonko put on its profile in social media information suggesting that #R will connect the forces with the movement of Kukiz'15.
However, none of these coalitions eventually occurred.
UBS: Golds close to the balance point
"The euro course will be maintained in the nearest months in the area of the ceiling 4.35 worms, which will be accompanied by a weak link on global markets," Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management communities noted.
“The expectation of maintaining a solid growth rate and stable monetary policy speaks to stabilize gold notes on the current climb”, the Bankier.pl estimates.
In spite of the clear inflation pressure, the Monetary Policy Council does not decide to raise the feet in the environment, where the huge majority of central banks mitigate the policy.
“If the gold is properly evaluated – the euro's notes should be maintained in the nearest months in the area of the ceiling 4.35 o'clocks – the Polish bonds are not so attractive.
Much more favourable profitability than the Polish papers offer bonds from the emerging markets," Michael Bolliger, head of the asset allocation on markets emerging in UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the worsening of the world's conjuncture.
“Global slowness may still be deeper, but it should not occur to a severe recession, but at the most, to the departure of the GDP's dynamic slightly below zero," Michael Bolliger states.
“Investors should ignore global actions that may be harmful to the lack of the prospects for a solution to trade conflict in the US-China line and other geopolitical risk factors, including the procedure for impeachment of Donald Trump and brexit.
Europe should be acting relatively weak among the stock markets," the latest letter to investors of UBS Wealth Management Mark Haefel shows.
"The actions from the euro zone should be behave worse than the Americans because they are more favourable in terms of increased uncertainty about global trade and fears of slowness," the document reads.
Michael Bolliger believes that after the Hossa markets of the most secure countries, 10-year-old German profitability even to minus 0.74% is still possible to increase the decline of profitability.
However, long-term profitability of long-term papers should no longer fall, but only short-term, with a view to mitigating the monetary policy of banks.
The biggest field for foot reductions has the Fed, which should lead to the weakening of the US currency in the horizont of the next years.
The long-term balance point for euro notes is a ceiling of 1.29 USD, which would mean a 19-percent potential to strengthen the shared currency to a dollar.
We expect further declines in the Fed's feet, which will result in reducing the differences in the world's monetary policy.
"To keep the dollar power in a long term, deficits on the current and budgetary account may not be allowed," Michael Bolliger said.
Bundeswehr's losing the gun.
The confidential report of the German MON
Bundeswehr has noted the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of the weapons and 19,445 ammunition – resulted in a confidential set of RFN defence resorts.
Information was provided by the press belonging to the media Redaktions GroupNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to the document from the parliamentary Secretary of State in MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one part of the weapons and 3474 ammunition arts have been retraced.
Among the military equipment that remains missing, there are six universal MG3, 11 automatic G3, four automatic G36 guns, six signal guns and two P8 guns.
Furthermore, 30 lufs for MG3 machine guns are missing.
The vice-president of the Lewic Party, Martin Renner, expressed the concern of the situation.
According to RND journalists, the number of missing arts of weapons and ammunitions is “enhancing”.
More than that, as a result of investigations, only a single part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summarized the effects of these actions as a "poor balance".
It also criticized that, in December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a severe act of violence threatening State security and violating the legislation governing access to firearms.
The officers have been accused of preparing attacks on the lead German politics from extremely right and racist motivation.
On his "black list" of goals, which had fallen into the hands of the prosecutor, heiko Maas from SPD, Claudia Roth from the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, the defenders of human rights and the founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. entered illegally in possession of four firearms, over 1,000 ammunitions and more than 50 explosives.
The crying kids on the plane.
How do you avoid them?
There's a solution
The Japan Airlines carrier has recently used the function designed for persons for whom traveling in a crying child is a nightmare.
By means of the web site, the aircraft's seats are verified.
If this connection travels to the second year of age, the “icon of the child ” appears on a specific, reserved by parents or seatkeepers.
Consequently, a carrier service person has the opportunity to choose a place away from that kid.
The BBC states that the lines have already informed the imperfection of this solution.
“Icon of the child” will not appear when the ticket has been reserved by a third party or if the last time a plane has changed.
As expected, the idea divided the internauts.
A part of Twitter users indicates that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved by noise reducing listeners.
They're kids, and we used to be them.
"We need to learn tolerate, because we will soon start to need maps of sitting seats for breathing mouths, spinning or drinking," said G Sundar user.
Another of the internauts noticed that he used to be disturbed by crying children in a plane, but he changed his mind when he became a parent.
There are also no shortcomings for the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
"Thank you for warning me from screaming children during the 13-hour trip," Rahat Ahmed wrote.
Major counts losses after bankruptcy of Thomas Cook's travel office
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not arrive in October for a vacation on Majorka as a result of the bankruptcy announced on Monday by the travel office of Thomas Cook.
As informed on Friday by the representative of the Balear Marc Pons, among 25,000 timers who will not be able to take advantage of October's vacation in Majorca, there are also those who were to travel with companies directly related to Thomas Cook, e.g. Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80% of the expected timers, which due to the decline of the British company, had to quit rest in Majorca next month, are German citizens and scandinau countries.
However, as Pons claims, since Thomas Cook did not lead to the ballar island to November-April tourists, the losses for the local economy will be less.
He revealed that the Government of Balears has already launched negotiations with international operators on the “input to the Majorka market” after the British operator's bankruptcy.
The Diario de Mallorca estimates show that in October, because of the tourist crisis in Majorca, more than 1,000 people will lose their work.
About 800 are fired employees of Thomas Cook's office in Palm.
Others will lose their job mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, with the announcement of the decline by Thomas Cook in many hotels, Majorka owners of the sites demanded from the guests to pay additional residence fees.
This situation was experienced by several dozen tourists from Poland.
The Government of Balears estimates that by Thursday, several of the hotels in Majorca stopped activities at least by the end of October, in connection with the announcement of decline by Thomas Cook and cooperating companies.
The Friday Journal Diario de Ibiza indicates that most of the hotels that worked with Thomas Cook in Ibiza did not deal with the intention of closing places in the next weeks.
The newspaper recalls that on this balear island, the British bankruptcy cooperated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the Balear authorities announced that they would return to the Spanish government to support the region of a total of 100 million euros to cover the losses caused by the bankruptcy by the travel office of Thomas Cook.
They have discovered that the most damaged in this archipelago of tourists, some 36,000 people, are in Majorca.
Based on the data of the Government of Baleaers, Thomas Cook is responsible for local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of agreements on July-September 2019 about 5 million euros.

“Rz”: Smog oppressed the government
"The Effects of the "Clean Air" program are null, and the coal pieces will wipe this winter as if nothing," we read on the first page of today's "Recposocity".
“To this time, the ‘Clean Air’ programme submitted 82,000 proposals for a total value of 2 billion evils, of which 48,000 decisions were positive.
The accepted proposals are summary of over 915 million zles,” states the "Rz", calling on information from the Minister of Environment.
As the newspaper indicates, only part of the costs paid are returned from the programme.
The results of the programme's predicted noises are estimated to be "shrome".
The authorities quoted by “Rz” are watching the defeats of “Clean Air”, i.e. in too large bureaucracy.
“The programme should be much easier: electronic reporting, sending invoices by mail, possibly irregular implementation control.
This would improve the action," believes Mayor Lizbark Warminski Jacek Wisniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alarm note that in the first year of action, less than 1 per cent of the target for the exchange of 3 million cotts.
As the “Rz” notes, although the programme budget is 103 billion bad for 10 years, or 10 billion of evils per year, this amount is virtual.
“In the National Environment and Water Economy Fund budget, the raptom of 1,4 billion evils has been reserved for this year”, we read.
Congress agrees with F-35 for Poland
Flash: Now price negotiations
The U.S. Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 of the most recent F-35 aircraft.
"It is one of the last steps before the contract is concluded, but it is not the end of our work," said Mr. Blashtak on Twitter.
"We will negotiate hard to achieve the most useful price," the Polish Minister added.
Contract for Polish F-35
Polish air forces have targeted 32 hunters F-35 Lighting II produced by Lockheed Martin.
In the mid-September, a consent for their sale to Poland was expressed by the U.S. Department.
The Communication emphasized that the investment will support national security and foreign policy of the United States by improving the security of the NATO ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
The information from the Department of State indicates that Poland is to pay $6.5 billion for hunters.
However, this is not a final price.
The Department of the State noted that the contract would also cover the supply of replacement and repairs, training equipment, engineering, logistics and personnel services and related elements of logistics and programme support and training.
Lockheed hunters Martin F-35
F-35 Lightning II, produced by Lockheed Martin, is a single and one-way hunter of the fifth generation.
The plane is capable of carrying out the mission of close support, bombing and typically hunting air fighting.
Thanks to the use of the stealth hunter technology, it is undetectable for the radars of close range.
The F-35 hunter recently bought Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace F-16 with them.
The purchase of US military planes should also be considered by other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.

Barbie producer introduced a series of genuine neutral dolls on the market
In addition to Barbie with different colors of skin, figures or hair, Mattel has introduced neutral dolls to sell sexually.
Toys with the Creatable World are wearing wigs.
So children can decide whether Barbie should have short hair or long.
Their dress is made up of pants and dresses.
In a moment, the doll can become boys and the opposite of girls.
They are also available in different colours of skin and with different clothes.
It was also quit emphasizing the characteristic gender characteristics – gender dolls no longer have full mouths, long shakes and thin tails or, in the case of Ken, broad arms.
The company believes that children do not like when their dolls have embarrassed sex standards, and some parents and feminists are convinced that the toys made with a specific sex stop the ambitions of girls and strengthen traditional stereotypes.
“The new dolls will allow all children to feel free,” states Mattel.
Doll Barbie, who appeared on the market in 1959 in bathing and high shoes, was repeatedly criticised in the past for promoting “healthy women’s stereotypes, ” such as the unnatural body proportion.
The concern responded to the criticism and already introduced a doll market with different colours of skin and more rounded shapes.
The dolls also showed up in the Hyjaba.

"I believe that the result of Levica will be very good, because we feel that people are bound to hope that Levica is not only right anymore, but also strong," he noted.
According to Zandberg, the left may have 60 to 80 ambassadors.
"This may mean that around the club, together, he will have several ambassadors.
But it depends on Polek and the Poles.
I will not guess and tell you how this will happen," he said.
Inquired whether Levica will have a separate wheel together, Zandberg answered: “We are scheduled to be diversity, and we will not pretend that there is no diversity.
I think this diversity was rewarded by the Poles because we showed that by diversity, we could deal with the common program."
Asked whether the biggest beneficiaries of the joint launch is the leader of SLD Wlademer Charzasty, Zandberg responded that his views as the biggest beneficiaries are central and left voters.
Instead, the SLD will receive the entire subsidy, he said that “the purpose of the political party is to represent its voters”.
Zandberg admitted that in the elections to Seim, he would vote on himself.
In the case of the elections to the Senate, he said he was wondering.
"The offer is diversity and there are candidates and candidates to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to which my heart continues," he said.
"I will, however, say very honestly and clearly that if I had found myself in the 44 Senatic District, I would take a electoral statement and vote in another circuit," politics stressed.
"I don't think I'd try to vote to Minister Kazimer Uvozovski (Kondidate KO - PAP)," he added.
In this circuit outside the Uvozovski, the leader of RP Citizens Paul Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PIS are launched.

These trees can completely disappear from Europe
“42% of the species of trees on the tree of Europe is threatened”, warned by the International Union for Nature Protection (IUCN), published on Friday in the Red Book of European Trees.
The list is headed by cashtains and scrubs.
IUCN, a Glandian organization, Switzerland, publishes a list of European trees in danger for the first time.
It was made by experts who, based on the research, concluded that between 454 species of trees in Europe (and other places of the world) 42% is “a highly threatened”.
The Red Book, among the reasons, exchanges the rapid growth of urban aglomeration and global climate change.
However, these trees and stomachs are most in danger, which only or mostly occur on our continent.
As regards a typically European tree, IUCN specialists are in danger of 58 percent of species, and 15 per cent, i.e. 66 species of trees and stomach, is threatened to disappear.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Book exchanges errors in the wood management, acceleration of urbanization, too intense cutting of trees, and further forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of mushrooms, moss and grows is also highly threatened.
"The consequences of human activities lead to a gradual disappearance of European species of plants and create in Europe the danger of extinction of important and underestimated species that are the basis of European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet," the report of Luc Bas, which is headed by the European IUCN office.
Gregorz Schetin: I don't promise 600+
"Today PIS wants to buy the Poles, offering them free loans to pay for future generations," said Gregorz Schetyna in an interview for "Recpospolite".
He said, “all PIS policy is a pic. ”
At the same time, the politics promises that "what is given will not be taken."
Shetina assures Jack Nizinkiewich that he has an idea to conquer the Law and Justice.
It's about mobilizing the selection at the electoral urnas.
He believes that the opposition has a greater potential in this regard than the Caczynski Party.
“There are more people who want to live in a normal state today than PIS, a party that has confided in public values such as humility, humility, transparency,” says Schetina.
The leader of the Civil Coalition and the President of the Civil Platform also noted the basic foundations of the CO election programme.
"First, nothing that is given will not be taken away, but you must set a direction for the future, because the PIS is only dealing with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, as you can see after dramatically low investments," he said.
Secondly, it is about “poles' energy revolution, assistance and investment in those who work firmly - and those who are entrepreneurs”.
Shetina explains that in the KO program, there was an project that the least earning Polacima would give more of 614 gold on hand and more earnings – also a few hundred.
The politics also noted that he didn't want to race for breakdown.
As he said, he will do as much as he can, but he doesn't promise 600 plus.
"I will never allow a Greek option where the rulers have liquidated their opposition to breakdown until the financial country has finally fallen," he stressed.
Shetina also stated that Jaroslav Kaczynski and Matheus Moravecki are afraid to discuss with him and Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonia.
"We'd go over their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
"The pride goes before the fall.
Kachinski is a man of state like Banasa is crystal," he added.
The Po leader also said that he has not yet decided whether he would seek to lead the Platform.
Argentina: Six dead big condors
In the Argentine province Santa Cruz, six dead large condors were found – TVN24 informs.
The experts believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
The large condors were probably poisoned by means of killing predators such as pums, foxes or wild dogs.
Animals could have eaten a toxic drill.
Besides one young person, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
“It is a great environmental loss because the condor must reach 10 to 15 years to become fertility and reproduction.
So we lose the protected species, the species threatened," says Luis Jacome, Director of BioAndina Foundation, the Argentine Environmental Protection Organization.
"I think the use of toxic bait and poison is not only a risk of this species, but of all other forms of life, including human health," he adds.
“Rz”: They want a jewelry for the President
They've been working on confessing the head of a precious chain.
The idea was supported by the office of Andrzej Dudy – we read in the "Rechpospolite".
As the newspaper explains, it is a golden chain of the Order of White Eagle, the royal insignium officially referred to in the interwar period of Reality.
It's probably the last time the President of Ignacy used it.
“Rz” says that such a chain may soon fall upon the arms of Andrzej Dudy.
The Commission for Human Rights, Law and Petition voted on Wednesday on a proposal for a revision of the law on orders and markings to restore it.
The Journal states that it is not also the first attempt to restore this chain to the State's head.
In 1992, the Senate offered an amendment, but it disappeared in one voice.
This time, the work is bright.
At the beginning of August, the senators dedicated this case for a few minutes, considering that they will reach the opinion of the President's Office.
This one came in half September.
"I shall be politely informed that the Office of the President of the RP does not report any comments to the position presented in this petition," said then President Andrzej Dera.
On Wednesday, the Senath Commission continued and reconsidered a little time.
"The president's office answered shortly: it's behind to restore it," said the chief of the Commission, Robert Mammotow, from the PIS, quoted by "Rz".
It submitted a proposal for legislative work, which the Commission supported.
The police will teach drivers how to ride through crossing.
The police action will be carried out, inter alia, on the heat crossing of Al. Pilsudsky.
In some ways, uniform actions are linked to the recent complaints of the city's authorities against drivers not always able to act appropriately on crossing.
On Friday, September 27, the police are starting the Prevention Actions of the Transitional Cross.
It's about eliminating the difficulties in the movement: entering a crossing without a convenience, not applying to light signals or road signals.
"We often think that we are alone on crossing, and we actually make life difficult for other drivers," Marek Ustrobinski, vice president of the city, said a few days ago.
His words appeared at the press conference of the city's authorities, where they presented examples of inadequate car movement after crossing, which in effect forms cruises.
The President then appealed to travellers for reasoning on the road, and, inter alia, to move faster on lights or not to write texts during the ride.
The theme was kind of taken by a lot of cops who have started the “Cross crossing” action from now on.
What's the matter?
The aim of action is to eliminate the phenomenon of restriction of crossing by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing driving.
This is a frequent offence that contributes to increasing difficulties in the movement and the creation of cruises.
It is threatened by a mandate of 300 oils and 2 punishment points.
Furthermore, uniforms will pay attention to non-compliance with light signals or road signals and the incorrect parking in the crossing area.
They will also observe the lack of liquidity, late movement under signals, free crossing and leaving too large distances between vehicles.
What crossings will be conducted?
Lisa-Kula from Jagiellonsk; al. Teeplinsky from Al. Pilsudsky; Targ of Al. Pilsudski; Sreniawitt Place from Dubrovski or Hetmanian of Warsaw Rebels.
This type of action in the capital of Podcarpacia will be carried out on the next Friday of October.

He believes that “White-Red” has not been obstacle to stress, linked to the performance that has been supported by a loud and numerous publicity to the tournament co-economists.
He admitted that the world's masters could have somewhat sleeped by a smooth road to the half-final.
"Maybe if a group phase fails in a similar way, we would be faster to analyse this lesson and then play another stage of the tournament.
But it's just a beating," he warned.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with the Thursday Failure of Polacima will be able to convert into aggression in the brown game.
"I hope we will then show our true face.
There's something to fight about.
Last time we fought ME in 2011," he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by the Polaci during these championships.
In the group phase, they competited in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, at the first two meetings of the group phase, they went to Apeldoorn, and moved to Lublana.
Nick Kyrgios: severe punishment, but in suspension
The Australian tennisman received a 16-week flight ban and a penalty of $25,000 – half-year suspension – for cruel words, gestures and actions during the recent ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour actors are losing their patience to Kirgios, but they still give him a chance to improve.
Summary of the offences of the most unreliable professional tennisman in recent years seemed dangerous – 16 weeks of break plus fever, but both penalties are suspended for six months – a test period where a brunette sportsman will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been working for a long time and has made his own tennis record of the world – he had to pay the highest in the history of discipline for breaking the rules of behaviour and beside it.
The loud curses, strange gestures, non-sport behaviour, insulting the judge and the viewers, breaking two rockets during the lost game with Karen Chachenow – all after the August ATP Masters 1000 in Cincinnati paid $113,000.
In US Open 2019, he also played a long time, but he was able to publicly say that the ATP actors were “corrupted”, which hurt the authorities of the organization so much that they conducted a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and, after a few weeks, the verdict on the suspension of launching and another penalty.
However, the words of corruption were forgiven, after hearing the accused and knowing the context of the statement.
However, the tennis actors have justified that the investigation has demonstrated that the conduct of Kyrgios for the past 12 months in many cases has raised serious objections and was almost a continuous violation of the rules that he has insulted in a vulnerable manner of tournament and viewers, from here a high punishment.
However, ATP gave him five days to file an appeal and immediately deferred the execution of the judgment, ordering to meet within the next six months of several conditions: at the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios tour can no longer violate the rules of procedure for professional tennisers, in particular cannot curse, destroy rockets, argue with judges and publicity, nor any other way to be admissible and soft.
He also received a recommendation to seek “continuous support” from mental trainers during the tournament, and also to consult out of the season with specialists in addressing the problems of sports who do not deal with the right behaviour.
The first comment (in social media) of Nick Kyrgios to the verdict was: “Hey, everybody, I can still play.
I just need to control my behaviour, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will still have a at least two-week break, since his injury of the bark in Lavera was exhausted, so he had to quit the nearest starts in Beijing (30 September - 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).
In the ATP Kyrgios ranking, it takes 27th seat.
This year he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, he earned more than 1.3 million dollars, so even after his fines he will have a lot left.
GUS: Poland is getting better
From the report published by the GUS on household budgets on Friday, it shows that, as good or rather good, the material situation was evaluated in the bb.r.e. up to 44% of them.
A year earlier, this percentage was 37.2%, in 2016 33.5% and earlier, since 2009, when the statistical authority first examined the subjective assessment of the situation of households – never exceeded 30%.
In 2009, it considered its material situation bad or rather bad, the total of 8.1% of households compared to 11.2% earlier and more than 20%.
The best is the material situation of households who work for their own account.
In this group, it is good or rather good for over 70 percent of the respondents.
On the second line, rentist households are households, where the percentage of such answers was only 18%.
The subjective assessment of the material situation of households also affects the number of children.
The worst thing is to parents who are alone in childbirth, among whom the good or rather good material situation declares 32%.
This rate (depending on the number of children) between 55 and 60 percent is quantified, and 48.8 per cent of homeless households are 48.8 per cent.
In these statistics, the effect of the 500+ program is clearly visible.
Before it was launched (in 2016), the worst of their material situation was assessed by parents who raised their own childhood and multiannual families (with at least three children).
Improving the subjective assessments of the Polish material situation is reflecting rapid income growth, especially from work.
This is not all, however, because the percentage of households that consider their situation good increases faster than real income.
Furthermore, at the level of leadership there is no clear dependence between income levels and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best assessments are formulated by the people of the Opole leadership, where their situation is good or rather good for 48.9 percent of the studied.
Orbus (47.7%), slass (47.6%), Mazovac (47.3%) and Western Sea (47.1%).
Meanwhile, the regulatory income in Opolsk (i.e. after the payment of taxes and contributions) was less than 94% of the national average and 98% in Lubusk.
The highest income of the Mazowski inhabitants (120% of the national average) and slippery (104%).
Average income in Poland was 1693 PLN in 2018.
In realistic terms, the price change adjustment increased by 4.3% to 2017.
In the background of the past years, it's pretty low.
In 2016, the income per person increased by 7% and a year later by 6.3%.
Although income growth slows down, it also inhibits the growth of expenditure.
Those, in the case of a person, were in the 1187s, which means that they decreased by 0.7 per cent in reality.
This is the first case since 2013.
In 2017, the person’s expenditure increased by 1.9% and 4.3% in 2016.
Studies of household budgets suggest that the statistical household is currently expensing 70.1 per cent of its regulatory income, while it exceeded 80 per cent in 2014 by 2006 and exceeded 90 per cent.

U.S.: Three suicides among the airport crew
Three sailors committed suicide last week on the USS ship George H. W. Bush – reported the US marynaire.
In the last two years, five members of the crew were totally killed.
The previous suicide took place in July this year and earlier in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each of the events happened on the ground when USS George H. W. Bush coasted by Virginia.
Until now, the participation of third parties has been excluded.
Furthermore, death should not be associated with each other.
“I need everyone to engage in presenting suggestions and ideas, how we can prevent another suicide.
I want to emphasize that there is no stigmation or other repercussions related to searching for help," said Captain Sean Bailey, a ship commander, on Facebook.
Nesolovski criticiously about the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing
In his conversation with Lekshicki Peter, Stefan Nesiolovski stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was for opposition actors a huge authority.
"Every opinion was accepted."
Later, some of his actions were criticized.
“For me, the fact that John Paul II was unable to eliminate the harmful activity of the Rhidzik is a great shadow on his pontification.
Because this redemptorist, the damager of the Church and Poland, has developed his media in the best place in the life of Pope Polak," he translated.
The former politician Po admitted: “There were dissatisfactions, the pope said something, once he had not accepted, but had power and for politics he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him to New Caledonia or Fijia to collect money for poor people.
But John Paul II did not do that, like his successor," explained Nesiolovski.
"In addition, this fatal matter of pedophilia and the action of the Church has arrived, and in fact they are lacking.
I've been thinking a little ahead, but I wanted to pay attention to his whole life.
We've known about the pedophilia scale in the Church from relatively recently.
The question is, how is it possible that John Paul II, as head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting matters," he said in his conversation with Nesiolovski journalist.
In the assessment of the former Polish Church politician, the Church is a PIS ally.
“We must acknowledge that during the Solidarity of the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the sacred Mass, the crosses were hanging everywhere.
Now these crosses are written, they have become a symbol of dictatorship — a sign of writing mode.
I repeat: One of the greatest unpleasant surprises is that people like the Rider Treatment by the Polish Church that John Paul II did nothing in this matter and that the Church is today an ally to the PIS.
This is the black chapter of the Polish Church for which the elephant will pay him," Nesiolovski convinced.
"I hope Pope Francisk will pursue the Yadrashewski, the Red and a couple of other types," he summarized.

Discriminated Gryph
The launch in the Poland Puchar between Gryph Wejherovo and Lechia Gdańsk with small hair has not ended tragically, when the whiskey of Weyherova race of millimeters passed the opposite team locker, Zlatana Alomerovica.
After this incident, the game was stopped for 20 minutes.
This case was investigated by the PZPN committee, which measured Griff's severe punishment, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to start in Poland Cup in season 2020/2021.
Additionally, the kibbies will not be released into the nearest game on their own stadium.
They won't be able to go through groups to the League games by 31 December.
The Burds at the Vidowe Boat stadium also caused the Wrocław Sleeves.
However, the verdict of the PSN was more mild, as Slesk warned that there could be similar events and allergyed the relevant authorities in this regard.
Nevertheless, the services have allowed the boat whiskey sector to be thrown in race, burning chairs and forsaking the holding sector.
This game was stopped for eight minutes, and the intervention police had to use the water armor.
The PSN punished Slesk with a single stadion ban in the nearest game in Poland and prohibited the organisation of goals in the games, including the next issue of the PP.

The names of foreign cities on roadmarks also in Polish
GDDKiA plans the exchange of labels on the entire management network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rheshes
The implementation of the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on the recording of foreign cities on roadmarks also began in the Polish.
For example, "Lions" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our military leadership, changes will be made on 94 road signs set at the A4 road and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it's going to be easier, more read and easier.
The new guidelines result in the update of the Minister of Infrastructure Regulation on the detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
“We should remember that the names of the towns in neighbouring countries are often replaced by Polish.
Thanks to the change that we have prepared in almost will eventually appear on the roadways in our ways.
The introduction of a new marking starts with the subcarpathic segment of the A4 highway," the Minister of Infrastructure, Andrzej Adamczyk, informed.
A change will be made on 94 road signs set at the A4 road and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total investment costs?
200,000 worms
In the first order, the new marking will be implemented on the A4, which is planned until 1 November 2019.
How's the idea to be realized?
He'll wake up without shifting the tables, basically a sticker.
They will now replace the functioning names of the new towns written in Polish in already existing characters.
Both names will be recorded in one row – first in Polish, then in the original, in the bandage.
This will be a great relief for those who do not know the written names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a swan from the windshield
In the bar in Zamačko, the inhabitants noticed a labyon with wings.
After the catch and visit of the veterinarian, it turns out that someone had a purpose of the animal — a wreck from the windfire was found in his body.
“He received information about the wounded bird from the villages of the Resurrection Centre of Wild Animals in New Soil.
The report showed that the animal had broken wings.
We've gone to the place.
It was obvious that something was wrong with him right now.
We acted quickly and precisely so that we wouldn't hurt him and endanger additional stress.
The swan was caught and transported to the veterinarian.
After the first picture of the RTG, it was already known that someone made him a firing shield.
In his body there were fragments of scratch," said Marcin Wallasek, President of Malpol, managing the rehabilitation centre.
Return in the centre
"The wounds were cleaned, the bird was given antibiotics, the access to water, a safe place in the center where he would spend the whole winter.
We're trying to reinforce him.
He's not able to fly for now.
Release would now be linked to the fact that he probably wouldn't have survived the winter," Wallaceck adds.
The personnel intends to release him on spring to the same belt.
The authorities of the Gmina, after receiving information about the cause of the animal health, intend to inform the prosecutor.
There was an event in Zamka.
Govin: “We need to stimulate Polish, tiny trade”
"The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the small trade problem, it will be necessary to consider whether the State has any instruments to incite Polish trade," Vice-Premier, Minister of Science and Higher Education, Jaroslav Gowin, said on Friday.
Govin, during the interview in the “Day Signals” in the Radio Unit, found that trade is controlled by international networks that imposed the Polish producers so low margins that Polish companies could not actually develop.
In view of the difficulty of fighting with this problem, Vice-Premier recalled that the Government of PIS tried to measure it at the beginning of the mandate, but received “contrast from the KE”.
"We won before the Tribunal of Justice and I hope that if the United Rights wins the nearest elections and forms the government, we will return to that subject," he said.
At the same time, he noted that “the effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish and thus small trade”.
"It will be necessary to consider whether the government, the State has some instruments to incite Polish trade," Govin said.
In May, the EU Court considered that the European Commission had made a mistake, considering that the Polish tax from the retail sales is not public aid.
The retail sales tax law assumed the introduction of two trade tax rates: 0.8% from income between 17 million and 170 million of evils per month and 1.4% from income above 170 million of evils per month.
The tax was to be valid since September 2016.
In September 2016, the EU law was violated by Poland.
Brussels then argumented that the construction of the tax may favour smaller shops, which may be considered public aid.
She subsequently found that Danina was implemented in a way incompatible with the law.
It also issued an order to suspend the use of the tax until its analysis was completed by officials in Brussels.
Poland disagreed with this position, but tax collection was suspended.
The EU Court of Justice's May decision opened its way to re-establish tax, but it has not completed the case.
On 24 July, the Commission filed an appeal at the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the TSEU press service referred to the PAP that the case is now in writing, where both the European Commission and the Polish Government present their arguments in writing.
For now it is not known whether and when the oral procedure is initiated, namely, the hearing of the parties and the possible proceedings.
It takes a few to a few months after the appeal to the announcement of the sentence.
"That's a medium year," said the PAP source in the Tribunal in Luxembourg.
How Do You Put a Child in Baptism?
We raise a few practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of the baby and his parents.
It is often the first opportunity to focus the whole family around the child, together celebrating its appearance in the world.
Not surprisingly, then, the newly baked mom and dad want their comfort to look as best on this day.
However, before you make a final decision about the child’s clothes, consider whether it will also be comfortable.
In stores, you can find a lot of dressing sets that do not provide a little boy with comfort.
What, then, should we pay attention?
The basic criterion of the selection of baptism is the age of a child
Until recently, several weeks of baptism were baptized in white sets and placed in the same beets or large elevation.
Today, children who come to damn are often older — months old, yearly, and even larger.
It is not difficult to imagine that such a great comfort needs a little more dressing for baptism.
Therefore, if your child is to be baptized for 3 to 4 months, it is likely to spend the event in a wheelchair or on the hands of parents or baptists.
The best way to do this is to make it comfortable, cotton songs or sets.
Although this garment element is considered to be a daily dress, it is enough to search for its excellent options, for example with a halbank or a crown.
For a boy, the perfect body with a mushroom and shelter will be shown.
In the case of older children, you can afford a larger fantasy in your clothes.
The girl's gonna look beautiful in a simple, tile dress.
Many of the young girls are looking to the highly decorative, famous dresses for baptism with plates, belts, and caps.
Unfortunately, a large number of producers use artificial, inhaling materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In looking for the appropriate clothing, you will better look at the Asanti for Kids shop, which offers elegant clothing on cotton suits.
The delicate, sealed suits, sat dresses, crowns, applications and charming sets will make your daughter look beautiful and comfortable.
Perfect dress for a little gentleman: cotton suit
Until recently, boys’ parents had a fashion on suits as a copy of “great ” models.
Polyester navals and pants, stiff collars or coats often made young elegants to show their dissatisfaction loudly.
Fortunately, they were made up by comfortable, cotton clubs today.
Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, i.e. soft, wooden pants, and then decorated from the front to the form of a vest.
These machines seem incredibly remarkable, and at the same time they do not disturb the movements of the baby's world.
Krystina Pavlović published the property statement
Cristina Pavlovic made a statement of property at the end of the mandate.
As a result of it, the PIS ambassador gathered 110,000 bad savings.
Recall that Paulovic foretold the departure of the policy.
In the end of the cadence, it shall be available at the amount of 110,000 Zl.
As a result of the statement made by the Member, it retires a monthly retirement of 4.7 thousand worms.
Pavlović has an apartment of 570 thousand zls and a little smaller that he rents, taking 880 zles a month.
The ambassador also invests in industrial metals, evaluating the investment for 150,000 Z.
Earlier, the property statement was also published by Jaroslav Kaczynski.
Voting for a break in the conference of the Conservative Party
The British parliamentarians voted against the three-day break in the Gmin Chambers during the annual Conservative Party programming conference, which the government called for.
289 ambassadors were spoken against 306.
Usually, the Gmin Chamber does not encourage the party conferences so that the MEPs do not have to quit either their participation or the parliamentary meetings.
However, the opposition parties considered that at such a key time as the last weeks before the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union planned on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt the session.
289 ambassadors, against 306.
Two opposition parties after the conventions
The lack of consent for a break may be taken as a political revenge of opposition at Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (in Tuesday, the Supreme Court considered the decision incompatible with the law and inadequate) and for not to apologize after the judges' decision.
After this decision, the Chamber of Gmin resumed the session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson’s event and the next violent debate.
Johnson dismissed the opposition of blocking brexite and avoiding pre-term elections.
"There's time to realise brexit.
It needs to be realised to respect the results of the referendum.
Brexit needs to come to the agreement on the priorities of citizens, health services, the cost of life.
Brexit must be implemented so that we can unit this country," said Johnson.
The Conference of the Conservative Party is to begin in Manchester on the next Sunday and last until Wednesday 2 October.
The two main opposition groups – the Work Party and Liberal Democrats – have already been held.
One of the reasons Johnson presented by explaining such a long suspension of Parliament were participating conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-semic attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-semic attacks in Poland are a response to the anti-poland retory of Israeli leaders," the foreign media write.
The president's spokesman definitely demented these reports.
"It's just not true," he wrote on the Twitter of Spychalski.
The Israeli media, including “Haaretz” and “Jerusalem Post” calling on“Jewish Insider”, wrote that during the meeting with the representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the RP consulate in New York, Israel was guilty of the last antisemic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the increase in anti-semic attacks in Poland was a response to the anti-poland retory of Israeli leaders.
He referred to Israel’s Foreign Minister of Israel Katz, who said in February that “the Poles sucked antisemism with mother milk. ”
Andrej Duda said he regretted that Israel did not apologize for his politicians’ disgrace.
He also mentioned aggression against Poland's Ambassador in Israel, Mark Magierovski.
In May, he was attacked by the assaultant who shouted: “Polac, Polak. ”
“The quotation is not only incompetent.
It's just not true," he wrote on the Twitter of Spychalski.
He emphasized that Duda “he never said that Israel was responsible for the last antisemic attacks in Poland. ”
The Spychal Portal says “he made it up. ”
According to the talkers “JI”, there was also a dispute between the survivor of the Holocaust, awarded by the Commander’s Order of Administration by Edward Mosberg and the rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with the words of President Duda and to say that they were the Jews of Israel “such as Israel Kac” were responsible for the increase of antisemism.
According to the sources of the Boteach portal, Mosberg was about to interrupt his statement.
Who's Bana and what did he blame?
The stone rented by the satellites led a journalist to discover neglects in the material statements of Marian Banasia.
We summarize another affair that shakes the running camp.
The TVN journalists have revealed that Marian Banáza, President of the Supreme Control Chamber, has not been incorporating in recent years to a property statement of a 400-meter stone that is located on the Krakow Suburb.
Furthermore, his hireman had sex business in the stone mentioned (and so rented rooms for hours).
In turn, the building itself was apparently the security of the loan payment since 2016.
Incorrectly, Bertold Kittel pointed out in the Superwizer program.
The journalist revealed that from Banasia the stone was hired by people associated with the crime world to use it as a place of “erotical meetings. ”
Clients were supposed to be men using prostitute services.
The charges of Banah were incredibly answered.
Interestingly, the rental of the stone satellites led the journalist to find neglects in Banasia’s property statements.
The stone itself was described in them instantly, and the income from the rent was to be declined.
“The mother of Marian Banasia and his wife may be worth between 6 and 8 million zles.
In fact, husbands can commend themselves with two homes, three apartments, savings [...]," says Money.pl.
And as a result of the portal analysis, the Banasia stone itself was worth about 3 million zles.
The Central Anticorruption Bureau is currently in charge of checking the property statements of Marian Banasia for the years 2015-2019.
Banah prophesied that until it completed, he would suspend his activities in NIC. “I will go out with you for a free vacation,” he assured.
Opposition requires explanation.
“We do not hear CBA to expand its investigation or accelerate the examination of Marian Banasia's property statements.
Therefore, we are forced to expose state authorities and notify the possibility of committing crime [...]," said Po-KO Major Witchak.
“If the normal Polac has so lowly valued his rental, he would have already had 10 controls, tax and penalty proceedings”, he added.
He went high, fell low.
Marian Banaa is the new president of the Supreme Chamber of Control.
This position was established on 30 August 2019, for the 6-year office.
His candidate was reported by the Law and Justice and by the votes of the political parties.
Rather, Banja was associated with NIK in 1992-2005, acting as a collaborator of the Lech Kaczynski.
During the first governments of PiS (2005-2008), Banásha has posted the President of the Customs Service and also the Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015, he has re-seated on the table of the head of the Customs Service and has been managed by the National Treasury Administration since 2017.
The banana has been serving the Ministry of Finance for three months in the government of Matthew Moravec.
Cooler Master introduces a graphical card capture market
Graphics cards can now weigh really much, and this naturally makes a place for the categories of products that would be vain to seek on shop shelves for a decade ago.
This is the solution – the graphical card capture for ELV8 RGB – presented by Cooler Master.
A new model of graphical card capture is not just a functional solution that allows for a more certain maintenance of the graphic card without relieving only on the sustainability of the PCI-express slot.
Cooler Master ELV8 RGB also has an additional task – decoration.
"Rečpospolita," ignoring the police's command will be punished
According to the newspaper, disregarding the order of certain conduct issued by the policeman should be a new type of offence, threatened by penalty, arrest or restriction of freedom.
That's what police union wants to make.
The idea came to the Commission's fair for petitional matters.
"The case is serious, because now more than half a million offences are being brought to the Polish courts every year," we read.
“Réčpospolita” concluded that the petition, which the Independent Police Professional Union writes to the Members on the change in the code of offences, has a chance to be successful.
The authors of the petition propose a new replacement of Article 54a of the Code of Crime.
It should be said: “Who is not subject to the request or order of a public officer issued within the borders and under the law, is subject to the penalty of arrest, penalty or restriction of freedom.”
“Per. 3 of this Regulation refers to the same punishment for those who do not comply with the orders to prevent or distort the performance of the service activity”, the Journal states.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski said “Réčpospolite” that even though he agrees with the main text of the proposal, he fears that if it is implemented, it can be used in political events.
"In the situation of freedom demonstration, this would be inadmissible and instead of mitigating the situation, even if it was sharpened," he added.
The newspaper statistics show that 86% of the citizens have evaluated the interventions of the police in 2018 and that each month the service takes 1,5 million interventions in the city.
Buras is worried about Europe
Yachym Topol has the writing in the blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
The father, Joseph Topol, was one of the most important wary Czech dramaturgs, which today was exchanged in one row with Václave Havel.
Thus, the curse of the talent that this man has tried to use has been obliged over Yachim from the beginning.
After eight years, he returned with “The Sensitive Man. ”
The heroes are Buras and Sonja and two sons, but they do not create a typical Czech family.
They're travelling actors, traveling across Europe.
He's a lover of Shakespeare and a thief, she's a one-eyed translator who doesn't break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys has not produced a sound since their birth, and for the second time he stopped in babies.
But they're not heroes, they're the most important thing in this story.
Everyone is just a background to observe the world where there is no room for artistic nomads anymore.
It's a world of screwed province, old, suspicious people, and a distinct youth.
"Vulnerable Man" is converted into an absurd theater.
Narration is imitating the dydascalia, and the heroic talks create this world.
The scene is Europe full of concern about its future, but also the constant questions about the past.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for an opinion
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an extraordinary offer prepared for the arrival of the German Görlitz.
Actions should help to combat the progressive decline in the population of the city.
Görlitz is the most eastern city of Germany.
Beautiful Pastel Ancient attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
However, as the Guardian says, the city is dealing with significant problems.
In Görlitz there are the lowest salaries in Germany.
The city also combats the permanent loss of the population.
After the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, most of them left west of the country, which falls by 25 percent.
In 2013, it amounted to 54,000 people.
In order to combat the depopulation, officials came to the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 proposals have been applied to the programme.
Two thirds of them composed large cities.
The programme was also interested in Hungary, Czech, the United States and the United Kingdom.
"When we applied, we thought the program was to convince people to move to Görlitz," said one of the participants in the project.
"Now we feel that it doesn't matter whether we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven thousand free apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the average in the country.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move on permanently, the main objective of the programme is to obtain an opinion of participants.
Information collected from interviews and questionnaires should help to restore small German cities.
"We want to learn more about what people need and if they decide to move -- what their motivation was," Robert Knippschild said.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new inhabitants, offering encouragement in the form of accommodation.
The first of them was Detroit, which introduced a programme of payment for a promising young specialist for life and work in the city for a year.
Today such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek Antiquither Island to Candela in Italy, or in the US Tulsa, Oklahoma.
