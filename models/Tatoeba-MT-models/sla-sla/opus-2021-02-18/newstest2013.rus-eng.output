Republican Resistance Strategy for the Reelection of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justified their policies by combating counterfeits in elections.
However, the latest myth in Brennan is considered as a myth, claiming that the cases of fake in the United States are more rare than the death of a lightning attack.
In addition, only 300 cases of electoral falsifications in the United States have been calculated by the Republican lawyers in the United States for ten years.
One can be said with confidence: these new trends will have a negative impact on the phenomenon of voters.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the American States are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most Governments have adopted laws that complicate the registration or vote since 2009.
This phenomenon was new after the elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, only one year of 2011, 180 draft laws restricting the right to vote were adopted in 41 state.
New electoral laws require the voter to provide a identity certificate with photos and evidence of the existence of American citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws reduce the preliminary voting period, abolish the right to register the voter on the day of the announcement and take the right to vote from the prosecutors.
Before the 2006 elections, none of the US states had obliged the voters to provide a identity certificate with the photograph.
Indiana became the first state to introduce such a requirement.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the law adopted in the Indiana in 2008.
The Republican authorities have hurried to disseminate this practice to other States.
During the last two years, they have initiated laws which compel the voters to provide the identity with the photograph, in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity certificate such as a medical insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, or 21 million of those who have reached the necessary vote of age, have no identity certificates with a photograph issued by the Government body of their state.
Furthermore, five million new voters have no such document in 2012.
The value of obtaining the required identity certificate is often over $100.
New restrictions are disproportionately affected by young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of the Africans, 15 per cent of people who earned less than $35,000, 18 per cent of citizens aged 65 and 20 per cent of voters from 18 to 29 years of age do not have the required identity certificate with the photograph.
But that's not all.
Students who are considered to vote for candidates from democrats are not allowed in several states to use the identity certificate with a photograph issued by their educational establishment.
However, the same States permit fisheries and hunting clubs, which vote mainly for the Republicans, to vote in certificates issued by these clubs.
Until 2004, no State required evidence of the existence of American nationality for vote.
This requirement was introduced in Arizona for the first time.
Since 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws that require the voters to prove that they are US citizens.
These measures are apparently aimed at limiting the vote of voters from Latin America.
Two thirds of Latin American voters are considered to vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, the republican legislators had initiated laws to celebrate the registration of voters on the day of the vote in eight states in 2011.
They also limited the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
This limitation did not go without the consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to bring about 10 million citizens into the lists.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have resulted in 17 per cent of the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators adopted in five other states laws aimed at reducing the preliminary voting period.
Thus, during the 2008 universal elections in Florida 33 per cent of the voters prior to vote were African Americans, although the latter were only 13 per cent of the total number of state voters.
The same was the same with Latin American sources.
Only 11 per cent of the voters represented 24 per cent of the citizens who voted in advance.
Unlike whites, 76 per cent of the voters had only 46 per cent of the voters in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their advocates are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several drafts of laws have been verified by the Democratic Governors.
The most unequivocal laws were suspended in the intervention of the United States Prosecutor General.
This had partially limited negative consequences.
For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted laws that require the identity certificate with photograph.
Nevertheless, the new rules that have entered into force will undoubtedly impede the implementation of the Election Law at the 2012 elections.
The criticism of democrats condemns the prejudice of the laws that have been adopted, seeing their obvious focus on the impact of the 2012 elections in key states.
The report of the Centre of Brennan of 2011 showed that the States adopted these laws represented 171 of 270 votes needed in the voter's colleague to win presidential elections.
It is too early to claim that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
There is no doubt that these new provisions will have a negative impact on the phenomenon of the voters.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Iron cancer covering: do you have a test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives mistakes, false and sometimes more positive results that lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, and those who are unwilling to do dispanse, have more to doubt.
Do you want to go through a test or not?
We asked the opinion of two experts.
Studies conducted in the United States have experienced numerous infections among research groups, so data received are difficult to interpret and hard to make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, revealed a different rate of mortality among those who had been in the boxing and those who did not pass it.
This study also showed that, after 12 years of observation, the probability of metastasis was 30 to 40 per cent higher in those who had not passed the boxing.
So I would recommend that you take a test from 50 years of age, or from 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Afro-American men are also at high risk.
The key moment is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is discovered.
Cancer can be both aggressive and violent.
The patient needs to clarify the risk of his cancer by offering possible options without mandatory treatment of the cancer of prostate, which does not constitute a long-term risk for life, but by choosing, in these cases, for active observation of the disease.
To this day, many cancer men will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We will offer them active monitoring, and if the disease starts to progress, we will begin treatment.
Increasedly, we define precise criteria to decide who should or should not take the course of treatment.
So I would recommend a test anyway.
However, it is also important to consult your doctor in order to determine whether the test should be performed or not.
In collaboration with the International Urology Association, Movember created a tool to evaluate everything for and against the testing of the PSA.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle reception to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, healthy lifestyle remains a better way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is estimated that if all people were fed well and moved enough, 30 per cent of cancer cases could be prevented.
"If no one had smoked anymore, the number would have grown to at least 50 per cent," stressed Andrew Bolier, the press secretary of the Cancer Association of Canada.
However, 10 per cent of cancer cases are estimated to be inheritance.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
The Cancer of Smoking for the Cancer Association of Canada remains priority despite the reduction of the number of smokers.
Smoking is 85 per cent of the cancer of the lung.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous harm to human health.
"Now, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," said press secretary Andre Bolier.
It is encouraging: 10 years after smoking, the risk of dying from cancer decreases half.
Wes
According to the CAR, excessive weight and obesity also contribute to the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, thick and direct wombs, nutrition, iron and uterus.
"The studies show that regular physical activity has protected thick worm cancer throughout life," the Association added.
Food
The Association also recommends that the consumption of red meat be limited.
In too large quantities, it increases the risks of a thick intestinal cancer.
Cotton products should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by pressing, drying or salt may lead to the education of canceroge substances.
"The latest can harm the body's cells and lead to cancer development," explains the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have studied the impact of vitamin additives on cancer development.
But at present, the results of these studies cannot be considered unanimous.
According to SCC, vitamin E studies have made contradictory results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other resulted in the opposite.
There is also no full clarity in assessing the impact on the development of vitamin D cancer.
However, Mr. Bolio stressed that his concerns and family analyses were important to discuss with the doctor.
"The analysis does not lead to cancer."
Higgs Boson in Details
In the past summer, a report that scientists may have been able to discover Higgs' boson has caused a real arrogance, and not without reason.
It is estimated that this bozone explains the mass of all particles in the universe, not much.
Furthermore, this is the last part of which existed in the framework of the Standard Model - our best, or, in any case, " the least imperfect" description of the nature and behavior of the matter - but which has never been discovered in an experience.
But physics are not sure that this is the Higgs Boson.
We know, no doubt the shadow that we're dealing with a really new particle and that it's very much like the Higgs Boson, foretold by the Standard Model.
Furthermore, the new data presented this week at a major physical convention in Kioto appear to be confirmed, although it is not yet available for the full confidence of some data.
Let's imagine, however, what this is about Higgs' boson, since the chances to make mistakes seem minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is, in this world, one law is completely inevitable, saying that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no possibility to circle this rule, not even try too hard, otherwise hurt yourself.
However, although the physics of elementary particles is quite a strange world, it turns out that there is also one law of the same nature: the principle of the exemption of Paulie, which suggests that two particles cannot take the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantum" is "status" in general, in some of their characteristics.
As a result, physics divide particles into two categories.
In one angle, we find good citizens called farms, who are reasonably subject to Paul's principle.
In another, bozones, the disgusting gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything, at least for this principle, which means that they can find themselves at the same place at the same time.
As the site (usually unusual) Particular Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratory, these bosons are divided in turn into two groups: the mezones that we are not going to talk about, and the particles of force, through which the basic forces of nature are distributed, and somehow the Higgs Boson.
These bosons should be emphasized, not all the exotic creatures that could be thought.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it's because of an incredibly banal bozone, a photon, or a part of the light, which is the courier of the electrical magnetic force.
In fact, when one particle with electric charges accelerates or modifies the direction, it violates an electrical magnetic field in this particular place, like a stone thrown into the pond.
From this "violent" wave is born by an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon, and, therefore, one of the bosons of "power transmitters".
A more stable field
The same thing happens to Higgs' boson, with only the difference that the other field, Higgs, must be broken in order to make this bozone appear.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to achieve very and very high energy, as if it was a freezing frost, which could only be a very large stone.
That is why a huge accelerator of particles is needed, such as the one operated in CERNe, the Great Adron Collider, which is a diameter ring of 27 km! - to achieve such enormous energy.
Electromagnetic analogy is also useful for the explanation of the relationship between the Higgs boson and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, but others do not: Paper sheets, for example, will never be held on the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who interact have a mass, while others (as a photon, by the way) do not have it.
So what can all these studies bring, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (SM) and this also allows physics to gain the difference between the results of observation and the MM forecasts.
Furthermore, some of them have a passionate desire for such a distinction to be discovered, so that the smallest inconvenience can open the door for “new physics” and shut up some of the model holes.
The last one, must be said, still has significant deficiencies, without proposing any explanation for gravity (o!) or for a dark matter that forms about 80% of the universe (oh!).
But so far, there were no such distinctions in the CER.
Effects
The benefits of these studies for the daily life of a medium statistical person would be to predict more difficult, but it would be a mistake to assume that it was not.
At the beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of laser research in Bella's labs could not even assume what revolution would cause their work.
They envisaged their applications in science, but not more.
In fact, a dead physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bella Laboratories, where laser was invented in 1960, who himself developed the first continuous laser (previous) in 1962, said that the original laser was considered rather as a "laboratory gadget".
Imagine...
Furthermore, the annex can be found for a tool to accompany the study.
For example, the same William Boyle developed a small light sensor during its optical studies in 1969.
This sensor, although it was not its original purpose, now serves as a " eye" for all digital world cameras and deserves the Nobel Physics Prize in 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Great Adron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative help is the best way to die...
The Commission for Decent Death in Quebec recently discussed a delicate issue of the end of its life.
The debate should soon be renewed, and the bill is being prepared at this time.
Nevertheless, there is much to do in this most important area.
"Long" tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. Lived one more in his apartment in Monterreage.
The prostate cancer that destroyed it inside gave him a delay for two years.
"I've been given five years, I've lived seven," he says, between life and death, lay in bed in the shelter of Victor Gadbua's burning care in Bela where he arrived before.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare for it," he said.
The disease is doing its job — an incredible weakness that does not allow itself to go to the bathroom or even to eat on its own.
By sitting at the table on the appetite meal, he surrenders and agrees to help him take food.
He awakes, even smiles, talks to strangers who work around him, brings him medicines, brings him to bath.
Courage before usual death.
"My greatest desire to be healed from the diarrhoea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the personnel found a medicine from this disease.
"It teaches us that a man should be pissed standing," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist in Victora Gadbua's shelter.
Regression to the status of the child - for some insufficient humiliation.
"Everything depends on the ability of man" to reconcile the decline," he claims.
Because, in the opinion of many people who are concerned with palliative cares, important developments also occur in the heart of the decline.
Patients who enter Victor-Gadbua's palliative shelter, are all cancer-sick.
Prognosis have been given to them at least three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses does not provide any more assistance called “healthy”.
Ms. A., 89 years old, is most afraid of dying in consciousness of choking.
But my illness allowed me to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in my life," she said before she allowed her to put a breathing mask.
She continues to wait on the coming days of the last visit of her son from Italy.
Victor-Gadbua's shelter is provided with a volunteer group to care for the body and to assist in food.
This is a palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, every 11,700 inhabitants have one place in palliative aid institutions.
This is very little, given that sooner or later we will all die.
This is where life continues in the best conditions possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors of the shelter.
Whatever is physical, emotional or mental comfort.
We will agree to the dying person to provide lipstick from brandy or pepsi, even though he asks.
The diabetes are no longer forced to control sugar levels.
And death is part of daily life.
We brought a beer to Mr. H., who died tonight.
His son finished this beer in his legs in the dead in the morning.
"We are helping our relatives as well as patients," Natalie Savar, the director for the care of the patients.
There's no day in Victor Gadbua's shelter.
In addition to a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family at the courtyard, on his toast during his honor, a young man dies 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two small children and tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months of three to five breasts, they are always busy with cancer patients under 45 years of age," Dr. Christian Martel said concerned.
53 per cent of the patients accepted at Victor-Gadbua's shelter are arriving from home, and 47 per cent from the hospital.
Probability of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77 per cent of the Canadians simply have no access to palliative care, i.e. to care provided to facilitate the suffering of the patients who have entered the final stage of their life, whether at home, in hospital or in the shelter.
And some institutions, such as Victor-Gadbua's shelter and the Society of Palliative Care for the Great Montreal House, are specialized more or less exclusively in care for cancer patients.
This great gap in the Quebec health system forces many doctors of the Pallative Care to fear the adoption of the law that legalizes euthanasy and suicide aid.
Starting October, the manifest signed by the lights in the field of pallative care, Dr. Balfur Mount and Dr. Bernar Ljapuant, testifies their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec’s health system is not sufficient to ensure the right to high quality palliative care before the transition to eutanasia is permitted.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in an ambulance, in awful pain, and no one took the necessary measures to facilitate them.
I'm afraid patients want to die only because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists have tried to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic forecasts.
Ellen Richard's hopes for survival were minimal when she stopped the exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment, she said she was sorry that I stopped fighting, she said.
She told me my days were counted!
There is no departure.
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the patients who ask for death thanks to the medical personnel for not fulfilling their request after the palliative care team facilitates their pain.
However, it is noted that palliative care is not absolutely strong in combating pain.
According to Else Monroe, the Director for Palliative Care at the Great Montreal House, patients are unacceptable to an 8 per cent of the disease.
In the very end of their life, doctors frequently struggle to a palliative sedation in which the patient sleeps until he dies, either occasionally, or permanently.
We can't pretend that we don't know about these sufferings.
All more and more patients who are unable to relieve pain will be able to access palative sedation.
The sick people who suffer from pain always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want to be euthanasy," that means "I want to get better."
The creation of this report has become possible through a journalist grant from the Institute for Health Research of Canada.
Huge scale scandals with real estate in Quebec
Officials responsible for road construction, construction contractors, political parties and Italian mafia experts daily tell what they know about the colossal " system" that oppresss the construction industry, public officials, politicians, trade unions and mafias.
The Industry, which was very expensive to Quebec's taxpayers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It is curious how this system is broken after all the funds have been released, the Jacques Ducheno, the deputy and the former chief of the Montreal police. "
It was the result of the scandal in 2011 as a side result of the investigation of official crimes related to road-building contracts in Quebec, for which the Prime Minister of Liberals, Jean Share, agreed very unwillingly.
The Ducheno Report established a direct link between industry, the secret financing of political parties and corruption.
" Since the beginning of the 2010 investigation, he emphasized, one of the Ministry of Transport would save billions of dollars on contracts," if some had kept their instincts to share.
The Commission of Sharbonno " has already placed two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will "open the schemes behind individuals".
Permanent Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Division for Combating Corruption, composed of a large state of government audiences, investigators and analysts, was linked to the case in 2011.
In addition, the staff of the Moloth Special Unit, which had forced Montreal's "stock cartel" after 2009, to cease the excess of contracts.
A series of searches have been made over the past weeks, and some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Rishar Marcott, the mayor of the small town, have been accused of fraud and corruption.
In turn, Gil Wyancour, recently resigned from Mayor Laval, the third largest city of Quebec Province.
He was suspected of repeated receipt of bribes when the public orders were placed.
Furthermore, the official accusation was made by several engineers of the communication of Montreal and the Italian manufacturers, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter exploded this bomb by investigating the "system" of receipt of public contracts.
For several years, Zambito has given 3 per cent of the cost of contracts in Montreal, a intermediary related to the mob, which, in turn, transferred the money of the Mayor Gerald Tramble "United Monreal " .
In the 2000s, Zambito screwed money right and left, and he listed more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about EUR 68,000) to various provincial parties, mainly the Liberals that were then in power.
He also admitted that he had illegally collected funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party, Natalie Normando.
Canalizing contracts with higher value
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption has worked indefinitely.
Gil Surprenan, a former civilian construction engineer, described it in detail before the Commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes in total $766,000 in exchange for sewer contracts that he had excessed.
Other employees responsible for the construction of roads have admitted that they have been receiving over 30 to 40 per cent by false supplements.
Then, an organizer from the Mayor's Party, Martan Dumon, accused Mr. Tramble of intentionally closing his eyes on the existence of a parallel budget filling parties with dirty money.
After these discoveries, Mr. Tramble resigned at the beginning of November, putting Montreal into a deep crisis.
Shantal Rulo was one of the first rapporteurs in Montreal who had been alarmed.
The mayor of the Rivier de Preri County in the east of the island is opposed to selling a municipal area purchased for $5 million and re-selling for... 1.6 million to the building paper.
70 per cent of dirty money in pre-electoral campaigns
She said that in the investigation that would eventually be launched, it would "pone the string to understand the functioning of the system of ants to stop the gangrene and identify the guilty".
This process is characterized as " painful but positive".
We are in the wound cleaning process, but Montreal will need its own investigative group and observer to avoid returning to suspicious practices.
How we're going home.
Regularly.
Jacques Ducheno notes, on his part, that “the officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars”, but particularly concerns him the role of “electoral officials who knew about the scheme” but not the intelligence.
Given that the share of dirty money in the financing of the electoral campaign in Quebec reaches 70 per cent, he jokes, "I was told that it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit to $100 donations to the parties, but he said that this would not change the situation: " Until we are strictly limiting the elective costs, there will be dirty money in politics."
It requires the full restructuring of the public contracts and financing system of parties: "We cannot fall down below; with a courageous idea, we can build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legitimacy."
If this story is shadowing the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Ducheno calls on those who are daring to look into their own court ...
"PSJ - not FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you've reached an unusual scope in the PSG.
How would you explain this growth?
This could be explained in individual awareness, but perhaps by a new dimension of the PPP.
Great players arrived.
I grow around them every day.
Technical personnel also contributed much.
These factors make me raise my game every day.
And during the game, it's easier.
Football's going very fast.
But I'm not burning up.
From the start of the preliminary training centre at the NIF in Clerfonten and before I came to St. Etienne, I was always moving forward.
So you're benefiting from the competition set by Carlo Ancholotti...
This summer is not new to play high-level matches.
They also know that every training is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me is eager to be at the level and to be at the maximum level.
In addition, Carlo Anchellotti is supporting my position.
He's helped by deputies like Claude MacKelle, who played the same position as I did.
Anchellotti's a master of the situation?
Of course.
Anchellotti has respect for all technical personnel.
Today, he has no equality in the First League, and he is among the best coaches in Europe.
He's got a lot of experience, and he won a lot of titles with high-class clubs.
He worked with big players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I left a series of traumas.
The confidence that he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSJ season?
In the First League, Leon took our leadership.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we have qualified effectively in one eighth final.
What's the goal of the club in this tournament?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
From now on, everything can be.
We can say our word faced with very good European teams.
First we want to end up first in our group, before Porto, so that we can take a match in one eighth final.
Will the PPP be the first-class European club in a short-term prospect?
He already has a budget for that...
In order to become a large European club, Paris needs to win titles and build positions for a long-term prospect.
It's not true today.
Financially, the CPG has funds to make this project real.
To take the title in the First League, like last season, will it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we really want to get this championship title.
In the past season, we were close to it.
In May, there was a disappointment because we had everything to get to the finals first.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
In general, 79 points suggest the name of the champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Despite the struggle for title, strong teams such as Marcel, Leon and Bordo have been joined, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media are expecting too much from PSJ?
It is normal that we are expected much, given how much we have invested and what players we have.
We're ready for this.
On the other hand, when we're home winning 4-0 against Tru, and we still find something to criticize, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We ask what people expect us first.
We can never win every weekend with a 4-0 account.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to introduce a game project.
The team is formed with time.
We have proven in the Championship League that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who has not been able to go into one eighth finals for two seasons, although they have also spent great money!
Given the invested amounts, we represented you at 15 points ahead by the winter break.
It would be ignoring our opponents and the French champion.
Leon and Marcel, who were not at the height of the past season, were "exhausted" by this new PSJ.
This shows how fascinating the First League is.
I hope in May we can smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The PSJ seems to be entirely dependent on the moves of Goldan Ibrahimovic.
Well, what if they say there's some Golden Dependence.
This only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he sucks a lot of heads.
He came for this and proves he's the Star of the First League.
Wherever he played, he showed that he was a big player and a star of global scale.
In the group, we respect him as a man and as a player.
He also respects people who surround him.
What he did is really exclusive.
This also stimulates others to improve their game.
Tjago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro-2012 with the collection of France?
It's like disappointment.
I wanted to take part in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from breaking up a little game time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I got out of there stronger.
Today I can play good selection games.
That's what I hoped since I was baptized with the Blue.
We learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we have to act modelly.
What do you think of the first months of Dedie Desham headed by the Blue?
They're effective for him.
He has good positions in the electoral group to the world championship.
He's a strict coach, he's close to the players and inspires winning.
What Lauren Blan was.
But I wouldn't like to compare.
Blan has achieved his goal, and he has qualified us in Euro.
I hope Dedie Dasham will bring Blue to Brazil.
A good earned man (1-1), ripped out on 16 October in Spain, is a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, my career didn't have a match like that.
Pay and sell without banks - with Bitcoin
Completely contrary to the current cash exchange based on central banks, numbered transactions between recipients with commission collections for processing.
Furthermore, how often these technologies occur, the political vision apparently: the belief that the current currency system, consisting of banking monopoly, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, designed by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonim), is a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euro ...) and a protected BitTorrent exchange protocol, which allows the exchange of files between participants of one level.
About 200,000 operations have already been registered from 15,000 computers in the network.
Several thousand sites are taken by bitcoins for donations or as payments.
The Bitcoin course, reaching a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell up to $2 months later, before returning to approximately $10 today (courses indicated on the Bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing special compared to the global exchange of real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency published in October was interested in this system.
It describes a bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "contesting with a dollar or a euro" and "ordinary currency".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, such as credits used for promoting the video games that are earned in the game or which can be purchased (and sometimes exchanged).
The Facebook social network has also developed a similar system.
But the exchange operations are always controlled and processed by any central body.
In Bitcoin, all the nodes are at the same time accounting book holders, audiences, monetary emitters, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two e-mail addresses, like an e-mail.
Only for each new payment, the user can choose another address by ensuring anonymity in this way.
The collection of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically using a double-cryption system.
The network can also verify the validity of the transaction.
With the content of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitcoins used in the transaction exist in the public account issued across the network.
The key phase is the registration of a new transaction in this book.
It is through a mathematical task sent to computers who, like a temporary central bank, have the privilege to add this new line.
It's about the hashing phase of the file, that is, converting a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers take a new transaction and add a number before they're hashing all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (mnh of zeroes at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes are easy to check that it is right.
The transaction is thus unrelatedly related to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, in order to deceive, the user would wish to pay twice with the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network, while the other would remain unconfirmed because they had different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the task is getting 50 bitcoys.
In order to avoid inflation, the prize is regularly shared by half by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoines in treatment is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided to one hundred million, which leaves other reserves...
The complexity of the challenge is also increasing with the increase in calculation power.
The life of the network has already survived the flying and falling.
The Bitcoin service sites were attacked, and the bitcoines were stolen from reserves.
"Used defect does not apply to the protocol itself," assures Pierre Nuaza, who recently launched Paimium, a real-payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported the possibility of washing money through this anonymous service.
But the cash also has a lack of money.
The major players such as Wikipedia refuse to accept such donations.
Others, such as WordPress Blog Platform, are authorized.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Institute of Weitzman in Israel, recently analyzed the accounting book and found that almost 80 per cent of the Bitcoyans are not in traffic.
The giant sales were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who worked at Coinabul, who was converting bitcoyans into gold.
Pierre Nuaza, another author of this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as an operational network.
His system, Paytunia, is an equivalent to the credit card (in this money) or the non-contact payment through the mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which thus makes it cheaper.
The owner better controls his personal data and thus can be anonymous.
The system is simple for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
Just inform the address that can be "fotografed and recognised" by the phone, tells Pierre Nuaz that he has thousands of users.
There is a common trend in the review of hierarchical systems for more horizontal.
"Before Bitcoin is approved, it will pass for a while, but 2013 could be a turning point," he foretold.
In its report, the ECB suggests that, by the way, the various risks considered to be increased today in the case of success of the system.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capisa and Surobi).
NATO and Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
For the Afghan army, it is time to regain control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future without relying on us.
We are mostly affected by the Afghan villagers we considered terrorists.
And we are, with 88 soldiers killed, injured and injured.
Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often from farmers who reject the presence of foreign army, as it was with the SSSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, so that even dżihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeki, Tadgers join them.
They are tolerated, sometimes helped by local rebels, but they will be gone as soon as the West becomes more delicate.
The departure of the French troops from the Ninjarab base, which I observed from the hills of the mindale trees, through French loans, was fine.
The convoys of trucks and armotechnics in accompanying the helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, the invasion of Talibans on Cabul will not be.
The circumstances have changed since their unbearable progress from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Cabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the fight between different groups.
They were then taken under control by the country as a kind of release, return to security.
Afghan women paid for the darkness of these farmers, in which Al-Qaida excels, but their situation has not improved in our day.
Former mojahedes, the Afghan Government and current talibs are united in their desire to keep women in a subjection.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They became participants enrolled in public lands to re-sell them to repatriates returned from Iran and Pakistan using large American subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
People, as I heard in rural areas, want a government that would not be a thief.
Many young people want to leave when those who have been generous of America will leave: capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in a modern world during the exile in Iran or Pakistan, and appreciated his advantages.
Approximately 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years of age; there are now 5 million inhabitants in Kabul, one fifth of the general population.
State schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
The jobs of these young people must be provided that they do not want to return to the darkness of old parties or to corrupt some leaders.
Everyone, including armed warriors, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operes that represent the modern world and look everywhere.
There's a army right now.
Will the authorities that will command her be considered legitimate?
Old leaders of the anti-Soviet fight have already taken steps to rebuild provincial wives who would not be subject to the central authorities.
Afghanistan, a mountain country, with strong local distinctions, should be decentralized to a certain extent by the Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized State with a strong presidential authority, removal of the post of the Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai did not want foreign control, especially before the elections for April 2014.
But his country, from the 1950s and even earlier, depends on foreign assistance.
Industries have not been placed on their feet, no tissue functions, no irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country destroyed by the 30 years of war, public control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There were rumors that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealths.
This only strengthened the feeling that western countries were there only to take over them.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on the ground, no transport means to export them through the mountains, there is no useful digging.
The Chinese have nearly abandoned the establishment of Media Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (Financing the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers of the province.
It is also necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is largely dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations on a fine day.
The conclusion of the French military units was completed on 20 November.
The new collaboration treaty provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: girls, boys, French University Faculty, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agriculture cooperation, support of archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in the intention of “creating hearts and minds” and to fulfil the impossible task of combining assistance with ongoing operations, the Military Civic Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, along with the small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public work and activities aimed at reconstruction of agriculture in dozen mountain villages.
These works, with the intense attraction of local workforce, have been able to stop the rebellion: peak, wells, drinking water, forest recovery, fruit trees, soil protection and increased land area.
What will we keep in mind by spending two billion euros on military expenses?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving the living conditions of the local population, very severe in these valleys, often at more than 2,000 metres above the sea level.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural work from local communities in Capesa province.
To get rid of the rebellions led by foreign groups, what the farmers wished, as they told me, we need to provide small military support that would be well controlled and directly treated.
Hard breeds of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risky step to President Muhammad Mursey.
While Egypt has been divided more than ever, on the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him extraordinary powers, he decided to play the wa-bank.
At the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutional Assembly would vote on the final text of the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of the State provided the Assembly two additional months to complete the work.
Soon for two years, Egypt has been based on a preliminary text that has been revised several times, which reduces institutional stability and leads to legal conflicts.
This new initiative only strengthened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President has argued in his "autocratic breed", continuing "violating the word" and "protecting the right".
His followers are convinced that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum should be held for 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the brothers to refuse the intention of explaining the text to Egyptians, article after article.
For the President, it is also a way to rebuild public and democratic legitimacy, while dissatisfaction runs across the country.
Muhammad Morsey seems to be convinced that the Egyptians would vote positively, as he said in an interview with the American Time week.
Moreover, the ultimatum call for accelerate voting is to the Egyptian people: “If you vote for my text, or I leave myself with extraordinary powers” which are expected to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constitutional Assembly, mostly the Islamist, voted for the text yesterday.
Most Liberals have not responded to the challenge.
In the middle of November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they knocked the doors and felt unable to deliver their views.
The representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 persons, reserved participants, were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that most cases of the article were voted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, distracted the fact that one of the few differences in the day occurred around... prayer time, as some members of the Committee considered that the time of the establishment was wrong.
The text on which the vote had been voted yesterday consists of 234 articles.
The object of universal attention, article 2 finally remained an identical article from the 1971 Constitution, which states that “the principles of the sharia are the main source of law”.
The Salaphist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law was one of the main requirements, were hoping to replace " principles " with " rules " so that they could be more strictly applied.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a evidence of their goodwill and respect for other participants of the Egyptian society.
"Licemeria," are the Liberals who see only the pira.
Because they believe that the islamation of the Constitution is carried out through other articles.
They indicate in particular article 220, which gives the university of Al-Azhar a consultative role, in particular in the verification of conformity with the laws of the shariat.
According to the expert on Egypt, Sophie Pomiye, this is an alarm, that is, "the people who are called to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can observe the birth of theocracy."
Many liberals are also excited by the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be much less moderate than the current.
"Now there is no specific religious intervention.
With this constitution, we remain within civil law.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not ultimate, but people with university, some have been trained in the French system," reassured Alexis Bloe, who is preparing dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledged that “around article 220 could be misunderstanding, since the terms used in it were borrowed from a religious lecture.
This applies in particular to "fix" [Islamic jurisprudence, - Prim.].
And in the future, the question may be how competent civil judges are to make decisions."
In addition to its religious perspective, the text adopted yesterday has been criticized as it gives wide authority to the President of the Republic.
Muslim brothers argue that they were significantly reduced compared to what they were in the old regime.
Another controversial moment: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the military wishes, the consideration of the defence budget will take place not in Parliament, but in the National Defence Council.
It will also not be prohibited by a court against civilians in military courts, despite the requests of the human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text they considered to be destructive for freedom.
Retained responsibility for blasphemy, and from now on no offence, which may have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for the freedom of press.
Furthermore, none of the articles are mentioned in the protection of a woman, stressed Heb Moraif, from Human Wright Watch.
It said that the only positive moment is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
The word not appeared in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to speak on TV last night, the manifestations were planned today at the afternoon.
Participants of the head of the State will, in turn, leave on the streets on Saturday.
Ukrainian tourists await holy places in Israel, Poop Earth and the sea from the dissole
The Promised Earth combines the magnitude of Bible truths, the modern comfort and the originality of nature.
The AIF has identified five of the most important reasons to be visited in Israel.
Worship of Holy Places
It is worth visiting the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that all those who enter this "bath" will be deprived of God's grace.
And Galilea is the place of the miracles of Jesus: the wedding of water into wine, the walks of water, the calming of the storm and the filling of nets.
Here Jesus appeared to the disciples and after the resurrection.
But most of all, the sanctuary in Jerusalem.
The believers here are passing the Path of Scorbi or the Cross Path of Jesus (in Latin Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretorium, where the court was, and on the streets of the Old City brings to the temple of the Lord's grave at the Mount of Golgoff, to the place of the Dispathy, the Stone of the anointed, and the place of the funeral of Jesus.
This is the symbolic Christian Poop of the earth, symbolising human salvation.
The monastery of St. Cross in Jerusalem was raised in a place where, according to the Christian legend, a tree grew from which they made a cross for Jesus ’ s sand.
The most holy place for the Jews, the Stan of Plach, remained from the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different confessions leave notes with wishes that are then fulfilled.
Execute vertical journey
The ruins of Massad’s fortress remained from a secret asylum from enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are situated on a peak rock in the mountains of 450 m above the ocean level.
And only those who are involved in climbing can get to them.
Others are delivered to this historic summit by a lift road.
And in the north of the country, at the height of 1600-2040 m, there is a famous mountain-living house of Hermon, where there is a huge inflammation of tourists in the winter months.
The bus shuttle is delivered to him from the bottom of the mountain.
The total length of mining routes is 45 km.
In ancient dedication, the mountains seemed to have lived by pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
In this country, about 300 museums.
You don't go to everyone for one trip.
But at least five of them, most interesting, are worth visiting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the ancient Kumran manuscripts, or the Scrolls of the Dead Sea found in the caves of the Judic desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and antropological exhibits.
It is also worth visiting the Museum of Arts in Tel Aviv.
His exhibition is widely represented by the plates of the impressionists and expressionists of Mona, Pissarro, Renoire, Sesanna, Sisley, Matiss, Modiliani, Shagal, Picasso.
Acco can be visited in the Al Basa Museum, representing several old Turkish bath halls with visitors and bankers of that time.
In Caesaria, we should go to the unique Museum of Ralley, where you can enjoy the sculptures of Dali and Roden.
There are no excursives or souvenir stores.
Input is free and donations are not categorically accepted.
The Fifth - the Holocaust Museum or the Pod-Yousch in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section - the child's memory - was built in memory of 1.5 million destroyed in concentration camps and gas cells of children.
You go into it and you're in absolute darkness.
The stars float.
And the names of the children of the Jews and the names of the lands in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Recovery
Three main Israeli coastal zones are located on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea.
Each of them has pools, aquaparks, delphinaries and oceanariums.
Interestingly, even in the winter months, water temperature is not lower than 21 degrees of warmth, and the air is warming up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and there is a round year of bathing.
By the way, this most unusual sea in the world is at the lowest point of the planet -- 417 m below the ocean.
The glazura water in it is a rassole that easily holds on the flood, even those who do not even know how to swim.
The landscapes around are unreally beautiful.
They are coming here to take the course of treatment with salt water - rape and healing dirt, and to cure health in dermatitis, allergies, astmas, exams, arthritis, bronchites, sugar diabetes, to bring the nerves in order.
To touch the Secrets of Ancients
They are preserved by the ancient part of Tel Aviva, the city of Jaffo, in the Mediterranean Sea.
Through it the famous seaway, which connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to the beliefs, this is where Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beauty of Andromeda, with which they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to boil on narrow streets called Zodiaka’s marks.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your mark, Fortuna will be favorable.
In Jaffo, you can meet a bride coming from all over Israel and even other countries at the photo sessions.
And in Caesaria, the city of King Herod, you can be flooded by the Roman theatre, "to take" the fortress of the crusades.
In the Roman period, Caesariah was the capital of Judea and the residentiality of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The well-restaured theater is now used for evening concerts and operacles.
Note Tourist
Going to Israel, don't worry about your imperfect English: about 30 per cent of the population in the country know Russian.
The money in the trip is better to be taken not in euros, but in dollars that are easily exchanged for shekels (that is now 1 dollars - 3.8 shekels).
The city transport is mainly buses, but there is a speed tramway in Jerusalem, and in Hyfe is the only line in the country of the metro, consisting of six stations and linking the Lower City to the Upper.
In fact, it's a underground funikuler.
The passage in all urban transport types is 6 shekels for which you can drive with transplants within a 1,5 hour.
The Saturday Saturday is celebrated in Israel in the Jewish tradition.
Since Friday night before sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport are stopped.
And Sunday morning starts a working week.
In many cafeteria, restaurants and hotels, only cosher foods excluding pigs, sea-products, fish without cheese and food with milk and meat.
It offers a large choice of beef and beef meals, soups and desserts prepared on coconut milk, traditional Jewish paste of humus, variety of sauce, milk-note balls — falalel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no walking dogs on the streets of Israel.
But a lot of fed cats that are very "looking themselves."
Even on the roofs of parked cars, they can be seen asleep at night.
Mrunders love human places and do not give up the hosts.
The car rental, depending on the mark, will cost from 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Furthermore, the insurance is $15 per day.
And the bike's sale is going to cost 15 shecks a day.
The museum tickets are on average 30 shekels.
Digital Language
More than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
The most arrival and rest was accompanied by the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
On the Promised Earth since January to October 2012, 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists were visited, 51 per cent more similar in 2010, until the visa was cancelled on 9 February 2011.
Great and mighty will lead to Moscow: Migrants dig money in language
While deputies and human rights defenders argue that the law on mandatory language testing will be issued, the country has already appeared by fraud who trade " lipsi" certificates.
Every year, Moscow, Petersburg and other Russian cities arrived in 13 million gasterbytes.
Most of them were the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenia.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of families remaining in the family.
Since 1 December, the law entered into force that each labour migrants would be obliged to conduct an examination of Russian language.
For now, this rule only works for those who intend to work in service, housing and housing, housing and discount trade.
In time, however, the FMS promises that the tests will be binding for all the arrivals.
However, the Russian history and the framework of legislation will have to be issued not only to the language but also.
The knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed for both receipt and for prolongation of work permits.
Exemption only works for citizens of countries where Russian is a public language.
The law is not subject to the law and the people who have been able to obtain appraisals and education diplomas prior to the decline of the SSSR in 1991.
The benefits, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of examination items will work under the auspices of the Russian Institute of Name Pushkin, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the IU, the SMEs and other Russian tires.
The migrants can be tested in all cities; more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
The Initiative for the introduction of the test was supported by the State and the FMS.
But the human rights defenders before the law entered into force have been able to ask the press many times: What would that give?
What will change the obligation of knowledge of the language for both Russians and for the coming themselves?
First of all, the representatives of the Migration Service responded, that would reduce the number of people suffering from " labour slavery " .
Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of labour migrants, explains the head of the Russian FMS Mission in Tadžikistan Victor Sebelev.
Protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized set system will allow 90 per cent to address foreign workers' problems.
There are problems with migrants without profession, education, non-scientific languages, without medical tests.
Without understanding the language, Sebelov is sure that the future migrants are condemned to face unfaithful people who would be able to put a “way” in a terrible barracks where he and his dozens like that would be induced for months without food and documents, incorporating 12-14 hours per day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one thing in their family, and when they arrived, they are deceived, picked up passports, not paying the promised salary," confirmed the Chief Office of Labour Migration of the MS Tadžikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't argue, inhabitant!
Nevertheless, many of the Mediterranean Republics collecting in Russia admit that they do not only know the language of the country in which they strive, but also write hard on their own.
Of course, it is not as much their fault as the trouble: few Turks, Uzbeki, Tadgers can afford even a thorough primary education.
Because their families have nothing to feed their children, not to mention that they are suitable to wear, shoe, and wear in school.
As they grow up to adolescent, they get to earning at first opportunity.
It's hard if it's bad with language, they're confessed.
"You feel humiliated and incomplete."
True, the law on the language of human rights defenders marks one important moment.
The test will be conducted only for migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or subsequent official work.
In the meantime, most of the guests continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or the Foreign Entrance Against."
Many of the arrivals claim that getting official status in our country is not that easy.
The reason is in bureaucracy and still the same language difficulties.
Furthermore, legalization is worth money: from 12 to 16,000 rubles.
But the false registration can be done quickly and only for a thousand and a half.
Russian police officers know that we mainly have fake documents, we don't have registration, from here, and cases of extortion.
"Please a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," said the journalists of the Tajikistan citizen, Umed Huskadamov.
"Flip, don't get up, buy a painting."
On the first day of entry into force of the language law, it was clear that migrant registration documents were not only false.
Several "lip" certificates for language tests have already been exempted by FMS staff.
Fake papers are printed on a normal color printer.
Of course, the new owners of the world had not been free: each migrants who had so hoped to facilitate the challenge of testing had paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is two times more expensive for official testing procedures: it will cost a labour migrant in three thousand.
The main challenge for the next time is to protect the system from corruption so that the “cracks” cannot be simply purchased, coincide with the representatives of the authorities and human rights defenders.
As long as the authorities can promise the guests who have failed to test the first time, the time for the study of the basic language course.
Furthermore, non-Russian-known arrivals will be offered in areas that do not provide active communication with people.
IMD does not turn into an illegal arms market
Crimes with legal weapons are very small
The IMD of Russia suggests that the law on civil weapons owners be strengthened.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: Push fires at weddings when no victims and the slaughter of the Moscow Lawyer Dmitri Vinograd, which resulted in the death of seven people.
The police wish to prohibit the wear of trauma in public places and increase the age from which we can get weapons license from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the Head of the Thinking Committee on Security and Resistance of Corruption, Irina Jarovaya, and promised that amendments to the arms law would be made to the State in the short future.
Not everyone is pleased that the Russian authorities are trying to combat the problem by "closing hacks".
The network has opened a letter, whose authors, representatives of various public smaller organizations, are required to refute " meaningless heights " .
The percentage of the jurisdiction with registered weapons is minimal, said the Russian Office of the Bi-Bi-Si Criminal Advocate, Vasili Lesnikov.
According to IMD statistics, 142 crimes had been committed during six months of 2012 with the use of firearms registered in internal bodies, while 1,68 000 crimes were detected during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the prolonged legislation in civil weapons does not place the criminal to go to the black market.
Now, they say, any weapons can be found in Moscow at a low price.
Meanwhile, the IMD claims that they control the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black market of weapons is filled in several channels.
The main channels five, commented by the Colonel in retirement by Victor Baranac, who has been working in the structure of the Ministry of Education and Genstab for ten years.
Screenshot of the weapons contracting site
The first is the Army or Military Trail, the weapon that was stolen during fighting in Kavkaza.
"The weapons were also dragged by Russian officers and the Cavcasans themselves," said Baranac.
The next type of black weapon is stolen by criminals from force structures.
The Lamb explains that both police warehouses are incorporated and stolen from law enforcement officers directly.
Illicit "arrays" are sold from military warehouses.
Many warehouses have often experienced explosions.
"There are evidenced versions that part of the flames have been made specially to hide the lack," said the former military.
The Baranz said that the weapons producers are bringing their patch.
"Private arms plants are now emerging, which do not endure competition on the international market and throw weapons from the floor to the black market, including Moscow," said the expert.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
There are particularly many guns and machines from poor countries, such as Kirginia.
"There's its production, sometimes crustaceous, and there was a mafia that organized the stream," explains the former military.
Where did you get the weapons?
The experts estimated the approximate share of each of the sources of illegal weapons supplies to the black market.
The report was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Disaster Analysis and Public Management Projecting.
Specialists analyzed the reporting of IMD and Rosta, Criminological literature and the open data of the portals on weapons theme.
The suppressing part of illegal weapons, the researchers wrote, came from the army and forced agencies.
Half of all weapons in the black market were " guilty of the officers whose work is related to the weapons," the report states.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the weapons are from the places of armed conflict, 14 per cent of the abduction of weapons, 5 per cent of the " black archaeology " .
One of the arms stores seller, who asked not to call him a name, assures that weapons found by black swimmers have not been bought in a long time, too old.
Mostly, as he says, the sellers go to the warehouse to the new party.
Through the flag, a man buys a unit, like a TT gun.
He's being expelled, transmitted through the barrel.
"He transports it to the city and sells 900 euros here for a piece of two shops," he said.
“Pravda, the police are aware of all cases, therefore, periodically when a crime-recoverable plan is burned, it is procurement by unlawful weapons from traders,” the adviser added.
"How in a luxury store"
Salesman and buyer are mostly found through the familiar ones.
I've been looking at the websites on the blogs until a companion who suggested to come to the "Bagova" platform, where a person will take me to the corner, where we're going to trade.
The price of the gun I've only learned there.
Military Auditor Victor Baranac
To get a gun, I need a friend who's got a way out, tells a consultant seller.
There are market salesmen, but there must also be "Ivan Ivanovic, who asked me to pass that his daughter had a teeth."
I'm even getting a few castets through a man who's confident.
He's putting them on me, too, because he knows I won't give it up.
The new ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
In the mid-90 ’ s, the former military Victor Baranese tried to be a buyer of illegal weapons when he was preparing for the publication of the article.
The schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album with a photo where it was "everything."
"I felt like a luxury store," a warrior recalls.
The buyer, according to Baranz, does not offer a cat in the bag; everything can be tried.
I'm a potential client, I'm not just buying. We're going with a seller to the woods, putting a target there.
"I'm given the opportunity to shoot, and when I'm convinced weapons are good, we're starting to trade," the expert described the procedure.
Couch store
Internet searches are available on websites and groups in the "Contact", where weapons are offered to be purchased "for various purposes".
It does not require any documents or personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they say in the advertising hat on the "Buy a wargun or a machine."
The users leave their applications and ask questions.
Are you gonna sell to minors?

I have heard of these schemes: the site is usually registered outside the Russian laws.
People are taking orders.

Makarov for $100
In purchase of illicit small arms, experts estimated that it could be attached to $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislova from the "Right to Weapons", Macarov's gun can be acquired for $100,300.

In the official statistics of the agency, compared to January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia decreased by 7 per cent and amounted to 22.9 thousand and the number of evidence of the abduction and explosion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
In the United States, fastfood and supermarket workers
Through work on the MacDonald Card, all American teenagers are up to four
In recent days, there was a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart's universities and popular fast food networks, such as MacDonalds, Bunger King, Tako Bell, Wendis and Kentucky Chicken.
Until no one begins to predict whether this wave will become the ninth wave or it is meant to expire in early stages.
Action supports trade unions and a number of left public organizations.
In addition to the improvement of the modest salary received by the Walmart soldiers and the fast-food system, the aim of protesters is to establish trade union organizations.
Until the economy sector is nearly covered by trade union movements.
46 cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving Day, on the so-called Black Friday, when an order of cheap sales in America was accompanied by millions of residents and sometimes accompanied by tramps.
On this day, some Walmart corporation employees, in which 2.2 million people work around the world, left their jobs and picketed with trade unions and left activists the corporate shops whose goods are based on people of modest and medium.
Walmart trades everyone in the world, from diapers, hunting guns and car batteries to dust, eggs and milk.
Products in his stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paid Walmart employees are only responding to their jobs.
The accessibility and association of goods made Walmart one of the largest American corporations.
According to the criticists, Walmart may afford to sell the goods to the sewage partially because it pays little to its employees.
The latter also complains of difficult labour conditions, such as the lack of carriers or manual scanners.
Participants in the Black Friday shares demanded an increase in the salary and set up that the value of the health insurance provided by the corporation increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
The typical Walmart employee, who gets $9.5 an hour, said that expense is not in the pocket, they said.
Scientists from the University of California in Berkeley prove that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12 an hour, the company will cost $3.2 billion.
It's about 1.1 per cent more than it spends on salary now.
If Walmart fully transfers the salary to the buyers' shoulders, each visit to the shop will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, they'll spend some $12.39 more than now.
Walmart's participants note quite that the protest shares were only in nine states and did not cause corporations any minor damage.
"Black Friday" continued in her shops from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and Walmart sold about 5,000 goods per second.
Overall, its kase machines produced nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, interviewed the left Huffington Post site that the jobs were quit as a total " less than five" of Walmart staff, and that the protest action was a "other piar trick" of its trade union.
"Free Cassa!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where they were not the university of Walmart (they are not regretted in this progressive city and are not yet here), and the MacDonalds and other cheap restaurants.
McDonalds says he's selling billions of bucks, and then he doesn't even give you hospitals and he doesn't pay you for your honest job!
Jumaine Williams, member of the New York Course
At present, the minimum wages, according to federal and New York law, amount to $7.25 per hour.
The fast-food restaurants increase it with time, but a little bit, and in the average, their senior workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
There are less of them in this expensive city.
How can you exist in New York for such money, it's impossible for me.
Once through McDonalds, almost a quarter of American teenagers who worked for their tapes after school, living with their parents.
Many have seen the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I'm constantly interviewed with McDonald's workers who complain that they should live for this salary and sometimes even feed the children.
On the other hand, at the Wall Street Journal Forum, there is a comment that the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know what to feed them.
The protest participants, which began on Thursday at McDonalds on the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cassier and fast food cooks start paying at least $15 per hour, i.e. more than double their current minimum earnings.
They also demanded that trade union organizations be established in the area of fast food.
The American Law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish trade union activists from imprisonment and dismissal.
On the other hand, the administration rarely facilitates their lives.
However, rapid food is difficult to cover the trade union for objective reasons.
One of the main is the unusual current of the staff.
Disagreeable
The noise protests took place on this day and in a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
In the middle of the day, the share was made up by the McDonalds' meeting, next to the Times Square, where several local democratic politicians were presented, in particular, a member of Jumaine Williams, who said, "Mackdonalds" said he's selling billions of receipts, and then he doesn't even give you hospitals and does not pay you for honest work!"
The demonstrants also supported other visible New York democrats, for example, the candidate for the mayor of the city, Bill De Blacio, who stated that "we must join the support of fast-food workers in order to obtain fair salary and economic welfare deserved by each New Yorker!"
As the New York Times described, this was the largest share in the history of American rapid food.
But it was only a few hundred people, but not all of them were fast-speed workers in which tens of thousands were employed in New York.
Until now it is clear whether this spark will produce a mass movement.
"So long as the brain's lying is medium."
The popular topic of modern technologies has recently been accepted mainly through special points.
First in the summer of her annual conference, the active model showed Google, and then in November it was known that Microsoft also filed an application for the corresponding patent.
However, from the discussion with the manager of the Interactive 3D Technology Group in the Cambridge Lab, Microsoft Sharam Isadi, the scientists of this company have a phase.
Their perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with naked hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Can you please tell me, in general, what is your research team doing?
- We interact with machines, but we are trying to move the borders of this interaction.
As long as humanity in the mass is stuck at the stage of work with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes the finger is ticking in them.
We would like to look forward for 5 to 10 years and predict cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox plugin and Kinect sensors is a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the gesture management.
- What else is ahead of us?
- Despite the fact that Kinect has carried out interaction at the physical level, much still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Introduction has improved (the system receives more data) and not much yet.
We're trying to change this, we're working on real 3D display systems based on different technologies, including projectives.
We need to release a computer world into our, physical, to make it more sensitive.
However, it is necessary to identify not only the user but also the space around it.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more comfortable form.
And first of all, these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think of the voice management?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it overestimated?
- It is definitely not to be called a panace - a matter of privacy, because it is not always desirable to inform the people of their actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everyone in his own thread.
For example, we had a project in which we were thinking about gestures, but not about the massive, but of such short, short.
The gestures were taken not by the camera of the device, but by the hand bracelet that fixed the movements of the bones and muscles.
As long as it's large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the hand hours.
But at all, the future of a mixed type of management, for example, a gesture+glass.
- What's that?
- For example, how do you ask me to give you this gas bank?
You'll say and show it at the same time.
- I usually just say.
- Oh, it'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to make users adapt to what they can or may not at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's mutual consolidation.
I think we're going to have to work mostly on the development of new types of sensors, which will enable us to define human responses more accurately.
These may, for example, be laser sensors, they give a good depth solution, that's very important.
- Speaking of your Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to modern cameras?
Is there a lack of permission, depth or something?
- In principle, the present generation is what can be distracted from in our 3D recognition work.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 with a speed of 1,000 x/s.
But it's not megapixels, it's like matrix and depth.
From the last point of view, all current technologies are not good for us -- this adds work to algorithm designers.
So you should remember not only the X and Y resolution, but also the Z.
It's also very important for the speed, the number of personnel per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 times/s are frankly low, especially for gestures.
Steven Bethishes from our Redmond Lab has made a sensor with a regulated delay in processing - from 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60 to 100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of humans and machines.
In my work, I would be very useful with the equivalent of such a device, but not a touch that would make the personnel more in a second.
- Don't you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three "camers", one of which is actually a infrared radiator, and the second is the receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is, in fact, the normal sensor of the visible range.
It is not applicable to determining the depth of the object.
The potentially larger number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or intensify it by increasing the calculation required.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogy of Kinect, play with the curve of the cameras and see how this would help to define the situation three dimensions.
- As I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its eyes to the audience.
Do you not think that, in the perspective of the daily use of score technology, is one of the most prospective platforms?
- Of course, all the time to walk, keeping the smartphone in your hands, not very comfortable, but this is what I think is the coolest option would be the "passing" supplemented reality when on the cloud platform you could switch from the smartphones, the screen of projection, and anywhere else.
The scores are a very personal device, and their power (private things only you see), and the weakness - the supplemented reality on the basis of the points will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographs in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the Iron Man but also to a simple mortal.
There is a problem that criticians often point to: there is no tactile response!
The hands can't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the complementary reality is the seventh breakdown in the interaction of the man and the car.
I think the eighth could be an addiction of tactile feelings.
At the same time, one of the interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a kind of image floor.
She's a great press recorder!
But there are technologies that are really aimed at bringing these "in air" paintings -- for example, the interference of several ultrasonic radiations in a certain point where the finger is, gives sense, but so far it's very weak -- as if you're being blown up on the pillows.
There are also wrist bracelets that affect nervous endings in their fingers, as well as the prospective direction.
- Did you try to cheat your brain?
Make him think he feels what he should feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried it yet.
There is another challenge to fight for a long time - how to force a person who is physically in a very limited area to believe that it is going on open, almost infinite - we also work on the concepts of runways (not in clubs) and huge balls.
As long as the brain fakes, work is still very long.
This makes the work on virtual reality so attractive to the researcher -- many things are completely initiated.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the Petersburg Avantgard project, devoted to the towns ahead, in the avangarde of culture and art.
The top list has already been accompanied by bright Petersburg art scene actors whose achievements are beyond the city, often finding a recognition in Europe, mitigating the universal Russian famousness.
The new hero of Rosbalta is an epiphatic artist Kiril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyrilla Miller, a bearded man, dressed in all the red, who meets the Russian museum, the Summer Garden, the fashion party and the backstairs.
The pictures of Cyrilla Miller always gather the crowds wherever they are.
Cyrille Miller is one of the socio-philosophies of Peterburg, who created new mythology.
Cyrille Miller is a bright man of the Petersburg Avangarda at the end of the 1980s, the beginning of the 1990s.
Furthermore, he is a man of the city, his appearance on the streets, making a smile in the towns who are in the mood.
Recently, he took the charm and became a Peterburg charming man, as he grew up to this complex role with all his godly existence, philosophy and images.
- Cyrille, why are you walking around the city in all red, not in yellow or barous, for example?
- I've chosen red color as a model managing the image and appearance.
In this world, red color is a compromise between artist, imagemaker and society.
Although everything in society that is almost gray is aggressive and abusive.
But my provocation is about to start a conversation.
The whole history of my provocation action is an invitation to the debate.
- And when did you realize you should be an artist?
- At the DC show in Nevsky, where my work was exhibited.
I realized it was my way.
Then the wave of old free informal artists passed, and the new, free of me were unacceptable.
I've become friends with the artists of a new wave, with a postgasone that led to Pushkin-10, and there was no more wave.
He throws me into the theater, clothing, music, all the genres, except the word.
And all of this went together in your Art Clinic... it was important for me to be in the center of Petersburg culture where all the best creative forces should be gathered.
In 1995, I took the territory in Pushkin-10, and there was a musical artist club, a goddamn club, a house of Peterburg's Bohemia.
Many of them were born there: NOMs, Tequila Jazz, I remember bringing Schnura with the Uho Van Gogh project.
Schnoore and his friends sang light songs under the fan, they were in a embarrassing trick, among them now was a fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group played alive, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was leading many programmes to the Hali Galiban times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went away, and he received basic education and education from us.
The "D" gallery "D" 137, the "Griboeds" club is a sound from the Art Clinic.
That's where our workers and our workers went forever.
I'm a hero of the last century when the culture meant something.
In 2000, the press survey was in, the prize was "The people of our city."
In the year's nomination, it was called me, and my culmination ended.
In new times, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our years, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is a recognised manner.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a clear expression of relevance and sharpness.
I'll have a program exhibition, the Russian museum in clowns.
Clowns are an overtime category.
I've been social before, being like this now is painful and terrible.
But the clowns are smashed, the tragedy is taken off.
I love Grotesk, I have grotesk ideas.
For example, the saving of peace through a totalitar change in order.
Now they meet on the clothing, focusing on the outer mechanics, not on an internal person.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand, and you need to spit in the face.
And the deception will be removed by reopening.
We've recently seen you as a city charming.
Whom I don't want to be.
- Well, could commercial art be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art must be a cautious, tactical, sweet.
Cultural disintegration is ongoing.
In the past, people were fighting in the barn, the goddamn loved one thing, the siblings, the other.
Now, everyone's broken into microcommunities, and now it's hard to enjoy everyone.
I'm not a $100 paper to like everyone.
Now you need to think who you're gonna like.
Now every cult hero has 100 fans.
- There's a few thousand on Stas Mihail!
- It's broken, it's a sex-social sphere.
And 300 people will come on the cultural soil and 10,000 won't come, and, as a result, less management, money, it's going to go.
I've got fans, and the main thing is not to be deceived, not to ruin the profit.
I wrote these pictures in my youth that one collector has them on the wall next to Falk and Larion's hanging.
I started with paintings that usually end.
The ideas are often confused.
They say that culture is spiritual, consumption culture.
There's no consumption culture, it's from another opera.
I'm a man of the culture of yesterday, grown up on the examples of artists living in poverty and dying in poverty, denied money to draw pictures.
I'm for this kind of culture.
- Cyrille, what's missing to Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: a cultural official.
But not every one of them can engage in culture.
With the right kings, the kings may not have much understood in culture, but they realized that the right experts should be kept.
There are good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in Petersburg who could be experts, but they are induced because we need higher experts who will appreciate and give them the way.
It's a tastey now.
The same Eartha, but they're different that they're honestly saying that not all the modern art we're taking, there are artists who should seek other museums.
- What is Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, much more in Moscow, there's soil.
And it's hard for art to grow on our stones.
We need cultural soil, and now we have more writers than readers, that's wrong.
There are very many people in Europe who are curious. They go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer of thin.
We need to make fashion art, as it was at the beginning of the past century.
The project implemented by the funds of St. Petersburg
Born in Outer Space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with asteroid killer.
The carvans of space ships with landmen on board are being deployed to search for a reserve planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question is, how can we continue to live on the same weakness or on the same reserve planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, the present planets are only two that can be conquered at least hypothetically.
"This is Venera and Mars," believes the Senior Scientific Officer of the State astronomical Institute called P.C. Sternberg (AISH) Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, the surface of Venus is 500 degrees.
You can only live on a large height or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The approach to space reproduction began with flora.
Half a century ago, plant experiments were conducted.
Four generations raised in the orbit of the woods were nothing different from their earthly species.
Then the insects, small fruitful much-drosphils are deployed in the orbit.
In 1979, eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops under the conditions of inadequacy.
We're getting an absolutely normal bird out.
And then the problem begins.
"The problem that this bird should find resistance must rise to his legs and begin to move," explains the head of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) RAN Vladimir Sichev.
Without the resistance, the birds screwed up.
And 10 hours later, the newborn had a full atrophia of instincts.
The birds did not respond to the light and sound.
And there was a problem that in four days they were just dying.
"And we've slapped birds twice, and then we refused, because it's impossible to work with them," the experiment with birds in the space of Vladimir Sichev defines the failure of the birds.
With animals, the last time the biological "minicch" flyed to orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring 2013, experiments will continue.
However, only single-poles will be available on the biosatellite.
There was an experiment with rats who were already sending to space with fruit.
In principle, there was nothing supernatural.
"It was just on biosatellites, but again it is a single experiment, and such studies must be conducted," said Vladimir Sichev.
After the landing of the Space Rats, the seeds have appeared.
But the problem of reproduction is not yet available directly in space.
It's a difficult task.
Animals, losing, a habitat environment, simply cannot realize their gender instinct.
A man, unlike beasts, may in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
In ethical terms, such experiments are not conducted.
But women fly to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereskov.
And the most precious thing humanity has is a woman's body.
Our Tea's gone, and no one on Earth could say if he would be able to keep it after he flys to space.
Is she able to give birth to a child after that flight?
"No one answered that question," said the missile-space veteran of Wachtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only a year after the flight to space, the first woman who was a cosmonaut, Valentina Tereskov, gave birth to her daughter.
The father of the child, Andrew Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, a second cosmonautic woman, Svetlana Savica, two times visiting orbits and even working in open space, was born by a son.
However, the risk remains.
We don't have a lot of spacemen who have long flights, and a healthy generation grows.
"And if more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," the outcome of the aeroplane, the Hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia, Valerius Polakov.
Nevertheless, humanity needs to seek some new paths in biotechnology, protection from radiation, creation of artificial gravity.
Hydro-laboratory is a mandatory phase of preparation for flight.
In this case, the cosmonauts are doing skills in open space in zero swimming.
Water's imitating inadequateness.
If adult water is comfortable, but still a foreign environment, the breast-feeding children are natural.
Little hattianders as if they confirmed that life has come out of the ocean.
There's a connection between the baby's approximately nine months in the approximate fluid, and it's easier to get used to the water.
It is in principle logical, because since the day of birth, since the first bath, it is only two weeks.
"It is very little to forget," said the instructor of the breast swimming Marina Axenova.
In the word, if the child's inadequateness is a more natural condition, a woman needs gravity, the strength of gravity.
Very quickly, muscles of abdominal muscles are drilling, taz, falling in the ability to push the fruit.
All right, let's put that down, based on the stimulators.
Of course, in a special cell, you can go to birth, she'll push him out.
"And then what?", asks Valerius Polyak's negligible questions.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the gravity of the earth, the body will not form a skeleton or a muscle system.
The newborn in orbit cannot be dressed as an adult in a special loading suit for training.
He'll just be deprived of what he's going to need.
"And this experiment that we will go with you, allowing the child to be born in an alien environment, will lead to bringing a disabled person to the Earth, a fully disadvantaged person," predicts the head of the IMBP RAN Igor Pestov bioethics committee.
As long as the birth of children in space is the subject of the theory.
However, later this will be a reality when the landmen on their ships will go to a remote planet that will become a home for their descendants born in space.
Chief of the Chief Audit Management: The verification of the system has failed by politicians.
In the public procurement sector, Czech Republic has good control authorities and, despite the qualitative legislation, it stands in its application.
This statement was made by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Control and Audit Management, from an interview for the Current.cz website.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must apply correctly, which I think we lack," Cala commented on the current situation.
Such conclusions provide a joint inspection of the Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of the wrong practice, Peter's approach to the so-called shwartz system is introduced.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that GDP (Grade Democratic Party) would not disturb the entrepreneurs by checks - does it be prohibited or permitted?
"The law should be established in some way and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of institutions which are obliged to verify and pursue obligations," Cala notes.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which compared the public procurement legislation of both countries.
What was the point?
It means a parallel check that we started probably two years ago.
Simplely speaking of the fact that European legislation claims how public procurement should be conducted, national legislation continues to apply in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even in an unfinished verification, interesting differences have been detected -- easier to say, we may have the legislation " precise and unfair", but in practice, we decline Germany on certain parameters.
This shows that the application of the law itself should be focused on not enough and more clarified rules.
And how can this project help you what it means to you?
Such a joint control can contribute to the efforts to stop clarifying, reducing and improving restrictions, as this does not result in a positive outcome.
The economy means acquiring the relevant item for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and perhaps criminal conduct.
But not the fact that we're going to do this by reducing the limitation of orders.
The system may be filled with "papers" so that those who want to find the loops in this system will find them much easier than if the limits were not lowered.
You are talking about internal issues of practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system function in Germany?
Is there an organization such as our C.I.A. (C.E.) or does it work otherwise?
With regard to institutions, there is also a college that works a little differently, but mostly both institutions function similarly.
Furthermore, the powers are similar to a certain degree, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and at the federal level, their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have government funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal accounting chambers.
With regard to local legislation, is there easier than we have?
In fact, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some ways, Germany could be taken as a sample, but it cannot be definitely said that it is best at all.
Is that because they're better dealing with control?
Definitely not, but again, I don't like these comparisons.
But it must be said that even sample countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any advantages from collaboration with our office, would they?
With regard to domestic legislation, how did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act affect any effect?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it has not yet been shown in our control work.
Since we control the fact, some delays must be taken into account.
We only take this into account in the process of preparing future checks - we have started using our new tool "designing the risk of ineconomy" through which we have expelled nearly 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them, and there, of course, these changes will be manifested because the limitations are changing, the conditions of some types of tenders are changing and so on.
Do you believe that approval of this law will be useful or additional burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think that the law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will be "increased" and will not be respected.
In the functioning of previous rules, the controlled enterprises are related to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes, with the regional Council), in the fact that any non-compliance with the public procurement law means violation of budget discipline.
Is this the law worth reinforcing?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who want to take and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal error that does not affect the solution.
Such a system will only create even greater bureaucracy pressure.
So how do you get out of this situation?
Let's realize that this is not going anywhere.
The Prime Minister recently stated that GDP would not disturb entrepreneurs by checking the so-called Schwartz system.
Schwarz-system forbidden or permitted?
The law should be established in some way and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of the bodies to be required to verify and pursue obligations.
We can say, "We're changing this law and fixing it," but we can't say we're gonna pretend that nothing's going on.
The Public Procurement Act contains strict rules as well as what should be formally implemented, and that is right, and it will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best proposal is disqualified only because of formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but it must apply correctly, which I think we lack.
The roads are slippery, but mostly pass.
In some places, the roads of Czech Republic are frozen and snowy.
They are mostly passed, but somewhere more carefully.
Carlovar County
This morning, the road was passed, but somewhere frozen and snowy.
Temperature fell from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day it should be a little warm.
The snowfall in the region has stopped, only in the lowers is a small layer.
However, there is about 30 centimeters of snow on the backs of the Red Mountains.
The information received from road workers showed that the places were less visible because of fog.
The R6 rapid road and the first-class roads in the region are currently without limitations.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface can be found and slipped.
All roads relating to the second and third class, including mountain routes, are also passed.
But there are still remains of frozen snow and places of frozen snow on some of their districts.
We need to be particularly careful on highways.
Pardubic and Royal Land
The Czech road and road management on its websites on the Internet tells us that some roads in the eastern Czech Republic are threatened by hololed, and the mountain roads and highways may be a snow layer.
District road workers warn drivers of hololed, which may be particularly in the elevations of the Pardubic Country.
Hollow may be around Lanshcrown, Orlean, Polish, Switavie or High-Mitto, especially on the roads of the second and third grade.
Roads I/43 and I/34 located in Swithavi are processed by chemicals.
Especially, snow is lying on the roads of Crocho and the Orlic Mountains.
The snow-shaped layer is located on highways in the Richnow and Trutnov regions.
In eastern Czech Republic, there is a variable cloud without descending.
Temperature usually varies between negative three and one degree Celsia, light wind.
Plissean land
The roads in the Plesen edge are passed this morning, but places need to be cautious and adapted to weather.
In the morning, the temperature goes from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places may be slippery.
The drivers may face the mist, but the visibility will gradually improve.
Information was provided by district road workers.
The road D5 is now practically unlimited, but the road managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most of the first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In southern Plesney and Tahovi, the found stations may be caught.
The roads of the second and third grade are wet, and there is also a warning about the possibility of accelerating slippers.
The drivers should be cautious, especially on low-use roads in the area of Schumawa.
Olomoucca
The drivers who are heading to the highest of the Olomoucca land must today take into account the snow casualty on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Red Gore seat and on the road towards the Videlski Crush.
In the night, snowfall forced road workers to leave the streets, according to road management information, about three centimeters of snow fell in Schumperk.
In other areas, the road is usually without limitations.
"The elevators of the Schumperk are the remains of the snow.
The drivers directing to Essenics should consider the existence of a snow casualty in the Red Gore Seddle," the CAN (Czech News Agency) reported today.
Their colleagues from Esenic went to cleaning the road at night, and they assured that the highest roads after the processing of chemicals remained naked and wet.
The roads in Olomouce are without limitations, but drivers must be careful in the forest areas where wetness remains.
Against the Liberian Land
Today, road workers from northern Czech Republic report that there are several difficult places left.
According to the police database, in addition to several places with hololed or falling snow, a mountain road has been closed at a station from the Telenica in the Ustec edge.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lowers, so the roads keep snow and ice. In the lowness, especially south-east of the Czech Central, on the contrary, there are no problems, the road is mainly dry.
The complications on the road are not yet reported.
Road workers report the appearance of hololed in the area of damage.
According to the meteorologists, for his education at night, perfect conditions were created -- the whole day rained and the snow flowed, the sky was cleared and the frozen started.
The main road and road I/13 on the border of the Usteck and Liberian edge are reported with disadvantaged conditions.
Because of the branches of branches of branches that relate to the road, the road was forced to be closed in the Telnica on Kninica.
Shimon Ornest: At the concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the many alarming news that we, humans, have so easily come to.
Together with the Tap Tap group, we keep joking about this and say that we are the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Furthermore, in December you will give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you tell the readers more about this?
This is a national gathering activity that we have planned for two years.
We have decided to use the marketing capacity that the Mayan calendar has, which was announced on 21 December at 11:10.
On the day before that, on 20 December at 9:00, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Island are launched parallelly.
They will end roughly when the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, the clock zone of 12 hours before we have, the Mayan calendar will be completed.
Who had this idea come to mind?
At first, it was my idea, and then we all came up with our artist Gonza Augusty.
In addition to the fact that we want to accumulate sufficiently positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state in which this world will be handed over to our children one day.
At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a unique collection of shoes, shoes, shoes, bags and original keys against the end of the world, which can be purchased on the www.e-tap.cz website and thus provide support for us.
The Tap Tap Group, along with other musicians, also fulfilled the hymn against the end of the world, called "The End of the Light is Revocation".
Will YouTube's loved listeners sound like a gimn at these beneficial concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if the end of the world does not end.
It is singed by all the performers at all concerts at the same time.
The gimnas will also sound directly in Czech television.
The words to this song were written and played the role of Jesus in the Tomas Hanak video, also involved in the performance of Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also cooperate with other Czech cultural persons because we have many charities and concerts.
We are trying to actively connect them to these projects.
It turns out that many people like to work with us, and they are interested.
What's the remuneration of the concert against the end of the world?
To buy the STUDEO without barrier educational centre, we've been working with the Tap Civil Association at the Yellow Institute for the sixth year.
The teachers regularly attend the Yedlicka Institute's school students and conduct fun and interesting activities with them.
Students themselves have no means to go to the teachers, and we thus try to give them that opportunity.
In the future, a separate building to which we will move with the project will be a project for further construction of the Yellow Institute.
A number of musical groups and performers will be presented at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to set up a program that would interest all generations, including children.
For example, China, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Irji Suhi will be presented in Prague.
For all details, see www.kpx.cz.
Do you plan any such "great events" in the future?
In May, we will speak for the first time at the Prague Spring Festival, and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
The next year we would be pleased to make a presentation in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we were in the United States, I would very much like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
With regard to the abroad, you have serious plans, you have already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap Group is a group of people with limited capabilities.
How do you deal with the way of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it seems at first.
We have five participants on electric wheels, their wheelchairs must travel in the luggage office, plus a lot of goods and tool boxes.
Nevertheless, the Czech CSA and British Airways airlines were always great for us, and I was surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, it went without trouble.
You can compare different countries to accessibility, public relations with persons with disabilities and so on.
What have you been facing to the present moment?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything works better than we have, we have become witnesses that we are still at the base level in Russia.
In comparison with Prague, Moscow, there are very many barriers, and there is still a wild man's own movement on a electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
It is not also in progress of such banal things as to withdraw the road to the disabled in the elevator.
Fortunately, there have already been public organizations that seek to pay attention to people with limited opportunities.
What, on the contrary, do we have to keep on reaching the front countries?
There are very many things that have a level of performance far behind.
However, it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depend on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is normal that people with severe disability move themselves on the streets, go to the toilet, to the museums, anywhere...
It is not very common that a large number of people with limited opportunities are actively involved in the public life, and we are making them a little ahead of the Tap Tap!
Respect for public or barrierity is one thing, but when we have known sportsmen, artists, actors, politics or lawyers, everything will really change.
As long as this is a single case, people with strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is now very popular, but we're going to go back two years ago, and what made you organize it in 1998?
I entered the Yellow Institute as a raiser, and there were many young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician, including the saxon, a colleague and a colleague organized an interesting musical circle.
Well, in time, as our leading Ladia Angelovic says, this has come out of control.
The popularity has only arrived in recent years, or am I confusing something?
That is true, it helped us to join the famous singers and work actively on the promotion of the group.
We concluded that the work that no one can evaluate is as though there is none.
Through the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Was there a goal for you to turn the Tap Tap so well?
From the beginning, I felt their potential in the ability to do something unusual.
The Shaw Business is full of things that imitate each other.
It's logical, all new things are taken with caution, and it lasts for a long time.
There are very few things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us, of course, pity, is natural...
But this regret is absolutely excessive because people with limited opportunities are not any suffering and all the abandoned individuals we should regret.
They are people who can live full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities do something, it's a move not only for them but also for the whole society.
Have you been successful in being a strict leader, as many of you think?
If we want to do the work qualitatively, we must be in many things compromise and discipline.
But I think that's normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic show and fly in clouds, and when they find out that twice a week they need to go to practices, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group who wants to work and achieve something.
The Tap Tap Group is currently composed of twenty people.
How many were in early 1998?
Only one Ladia Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come and leave, that's impossible to prevent.
For those who have desire and power of will, our doors are always open.
It will take place on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00 a.m. before the expected end of the world.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno, Fléda and Island, in the centre of Plynoam, with the participation of 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by telemos at the time of the Tap Tap song "The End of the Light is cancelled".
The project is aimed at collecting funds of 25 million crowns for procurement of multi-functional non-barrier equipment for the STUDEO education centre at the Yedlicka Institute in Prague.
The ticket for the concert is 400 crowns, for children up to 12 years of age free.
Poland and space.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern Block (after Czech Republic, who became a full member of ECA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the ECA in 1994 and in recent years actively participated in a number of projects of the agency.
But the way to space, Poland began much earlier.
By the time of World War II, Polish enthusiasts had been flying to space, but it was not always understood.
Recall, for example, the lecture of A. Sternfeld, who presented the idea in the Warsaw astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933 from his innovative work " Introduction to Space".
The ideas of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after a few years, Sterfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sterfeld won Robert Esno-Peltry and Andre Luis Hirsch for "Introduction in Space".
Dr. Ian Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great propaganda for astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
The Hadomian became a world promotionist of space, and its contribution was evaluated, including that one of the craters on the back side of the Moon was named in his honor.
In 1925, a railway vehicle was built in Poland, equipped with a missile engine.
Unfortunately, the author remained unknown as well as the details of the project.
It is not even clear that a rocket was to be used for race or brake.
The information about this clothing is known only from the press of that period.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to think about missile arrows.
Study was conducted by the Arms Technology Section in collaboration with Professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustav Mokžicki.
The stored material shows that studies have come to a stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of German troops, the work had been interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photo-electric executive missile proposed by the Rogozinian engineer was made in the specialized print, and the next year, the air missile torpedo and the aviation bomb missile of the author of Leviva-Kivoblocki.
Both projects were developed for military use of missile engines.
The Temporary Scientific and Scientific Committee, which coordinated all the work, had been undertaken before the war of all the projects of military use of missile techniques.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its work, the work was completed since the war began.
The next scientific work devoted to cosmonauticism has occurred in the Polish press after the war through the work of the Polish Astronautic Society (Poland Astronautic Society).
The first issue of society is mentioned in the November 1954 magazine " Problems " in which four volume articles are published on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Sabotovic suggested that society be organized for a space-based work.
The projects of artificial satellites have already been collected, and it was clear that space research was a prospective sector.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish astronautical society (POA) has tried to join the international astronautical Federation (based in 1951) and has already become its real member in the autumn.
In the next year, the first President of POA, Kazimin Zarankevic (1902-1959), became Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained on this post until his death, which came in 1959.
Since 1956, POA has contributed significantly to the development of a very successful Meteorological missile RM (Meteorological Raketa), which has become the first Polish missile that has carried out a scientific research.
The first RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch was held on 10 October 1958.
The rocket capable of overcoming the distance of 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved RM-1A version was built, and in the summer of 1959, a two-step missile RM-2 was tested.
The rocket was about 1.4 m long, and it was approximately 11.5 pounds.
The next version of the missile was already capable of doing this scientific work - the RM-34 missile could have exceeded 14,5 km and its mission was to monitor the high wind.
But further development was suspended in 1962.
The first rockets of RM were the Meteor-1 missile developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed to be two-step, its total length was 510 cm and the initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which were different from the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket has a range of 0.4 l, Meteor-1V - 0.34 l, and Meteor-1S - 0.62l.
The maximum distance of all three types of flight was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute was developing a Meteor-2 missile, and its first summer tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a starting weight of 380 kg was able to produce a useful weight of 10 kg per height of about 60 km.
The versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were then built.
It is also important to mention the entry of Poland into COSPAR (the Committee on Outer Space Studies) in 1960 and the establishment of a national committee of COSPAR two years later.
In addition, in the Intersmos programme, Poland participated in space studies in Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermashevski became the second interconsmonaut after Vladimir Remeka.
Abolition of the public work law is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the constitutional court canceled the public work law.
The provision raised a live discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
The liberalized economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of multiplied, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are constantly conflicting.
This is linked to the principle of free trade and free, unlimited movement of private capital, together with uncontained financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the cost of workforce (payment) arises price tension.
Under this perception, it must be understood when the manufacturer, through the delivery of cheap goods, endeavours to stand in economic competition by " defeating" the value of the competitive in order to retrieve a majority of the market and thus increase his own income.
In a massive scale, this means that most entrepreneurs are transferred by abroad, or cheap procurement, or disappearance, and that increases unemployment in countries where the cost of workforce, compared to others, is high.
Since the private capital does not bear social responsibility, including its unemployment, the inevitable expenditure of the State for social needs will grow.
In general, the situation strengthens the undesirableness of entrepreneur's masters to pay taxes and thus compensate for the social economic and social damage caused by them in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there are no need to be specific statistics.
Inferior methods of private capital create at the level of economies of individual States when Governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, Governments have given their own population to a private capital despite the social decline.
This is reflected in the amendments of the existing legislation.
The goal is to make their people obey the dictation of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This acts as a system of economic force in case of long unemployment, while at the same time serves as a tool for cutting the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty is increasing and the difference between the poor and the rich .
In the FGG, there has been a public distribution of poor products for years who are unable to feed themselves with their own work.
The number of these people is nearing a million.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, the employees receive such a salary that the State must compensate for them to obtain a living minimum.
Such a scandal has become known to the public as well as for additional Bundestag workers.
The economic measures practically in all southern States of the EU are undoubtedly the same state as those under the pressure of the disaster fall of social status have to either emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or exist for poverty in the courtyards of society in hope that private investment capital will ever come into the country.
However, it is wondering where he would come from?
If the capital comes from other EU countries, the poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as Chinese, hindus, Brazilian, Turks, Moroccan, Egyptian, the African still works for the European salary.
This concerns Latin America.
Liberal theory and media to the fatigue argue that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own household, which leads to economic disaster.
Private capital strongly insists that the State should not interfere with the governing actions.
Further should the question of whether the private capital, which is now practically the governor of the policy and the whole State, is to be selfish for its own purposes?
The answer is yes.
The evidence is the existence of almost all-powered and everywhere-wide lobbys in all States.
As a result, we have an imminent situation in corruption, mutual benefits, in legislation where almost everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In the FRG the situation is that government ministries, due to the lack of financial funds, are commissioning the development of laws to private legal companies who are closely linked to industry.
Subsequently, Bundestag approved these drafts.
The entire authority is not from the people, as the Western Constitution says, but from financial and financial groups prefering their own interests.
Apparently, Liberally-oriented democracy is now in such a situation as the Appiant described in the production of the Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompeum: " The government has been dissolved for a long time, and the offices have been engaged in violence.
Contracts, illicit receipt of mercy through stones and swords.
The bribes and corruption have prospered without any prohibitions, and the people have gone to elections with the previously sold vote"... the proper people have not even voted for the ruler's position, at the end of the end of eight months, the State remained unconsulated.... .. .. .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
As in ancient times, in modern society, their own unreasonable interests are prevailing without taking into account public interests.
Private capital is, in fact, not for use for public purposes.
The current result is not different from the past: the immense decline of the elite without any effort to reform deeper.
Therefore, the cause of fascist and communist regimes we must find in the unreasonable liberalization of economic systems for 19 and 20 centuries.
The absence of these regimes and the existence of Liberal Democracy can be considered as a certain pause after which the next tour is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social disasters that we have already seen, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
Abolition of the Public Work Act is not a solution or, at least, not forever.
Under the pressure of competition, both at the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of population.
This trend is thus systematic.
The decision is the goals of political and social reforms that will strengthen the State ' s integrity in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the governance of the State and weaken the monopolity of private capital for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"Nothing will come out of violence and never can come out." - Sting, the Sting, the Crush, where the main verse of the refreen is the words: "Don't forget how we're creepy."
"If my sons didn't want wars, they wouldn't be," the dying Gutel Schnaper, the wife of Meer Amshel Rothschild.
The last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has resulted in numerous responses.
Some speak for Israel by argumenting that he has the right to self-defense and the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians by racism of the Israeli State, the genocide committed over the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel associates the role of a terrorist State.
I don't want to think about who in these periodically repeated murder waves was a criminal and who, eventually, the victims of today's nationals of Israel, including self-governmented territories, were born at the moment of the current political situation and were not witnessing the beginning of violence.
My goal is to invite the readers to look at the curtain, to see who is first in charge of tension for 95 years (with the signing of the Balfur Declaration in November 1917) in the small part of the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are supported by historical facts, some of them are based on my own understanding of who or which group of people are the main engine of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is the first history of fighting for power.
We can find the same Alexander the Great or the Napoleon in every era.
That is not so clear, whether these people have always taken their own steps, or behind their throne, someone who was directing their actions towards their prior purposes.
It should be assumed that we live in a period where the world wealth is concentrated in the hands of a number of individuals, and that the concentration of money and the emerging authority could not occur in the life of a generation.
Among the astronomically wealthy families is one that could be viewed as the head of the spart (I don't know if anyone is above them but is not excluded) - Rothschilds.
They don't write much about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) had purchased in the 1990s to stop the rumors linking their name to criminal acts in the higher areas of which they were in the shadows and which always led to strengthening their powers, enrichment of wealth, either at the same time, and to the other.
They have large stocks of shares in almost all central banks of the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have their shares, they lead or prepare war (only 7 countries had been invaded in Afghanistan, after the invasion of Iraq, the Caddafi had only four, but at the same time the Russian Government took the central bank of its country into its own hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve the status of the Central Bank behind the Rothshild Bank of America, and he began to release his own (conscious government) money and was killed in the theater in 1865.
John F. Kennedy began to release his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (the Federal Reserve System), killed in 1963, and the Deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the FED for the resolution of the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for the world's power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan of three world wars created by the large masone of the 33th level, Albert Pike.
The challenge of the first war was the destruction of monarchic States in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Britain, and the third must lead to a reduction of world population to approximately 0.5-1 billion (i.e. the number of slaves would be sufficient to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they would not consume much resources), to create a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be anything but a prerequisite for such a project) and the final deployment of the absolute authority.
The Method, with which the wealthiest families in the head of Rothschilds are the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent proposal for decisions (order ab chao is a chaos order).
However, these decisions are fake and are always making the situation worse (see the FED foundation, which had to prevent the repeating of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they had managed to untie the First World War by killing the Habsburg heir of the Austria Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed Royal Russia by starting a more visual revolution.
The first world war ended a sudden, unreasonable military and economically unreasonable capitulation of Germany (without the need for a war to destroy Royal Russia) and, as a result, a fracture of the Central European Power, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the resolution of World War II, bankers and politicians had created a hidden conflict situation, putting large military reparations on Germany, rather than a prevention for radicalization of meals, then only the Germans had to be subjected to a sufficiently strong, blaming and offering simple solutions of the Leader, to further create a multinational Czech Republic with a strong German minority that had to be played, and indeed played the function of the fifth column, in the burning of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschilds provoked the foundation of a sionist movement, one branch of which had been endeavoured to establish a Jewish State, desirable in the field of historic Judea and Jerusalem as its capital (return to Sion).
The above declaration of Balfura set up a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first conflicts with the local Arab population began.
Terrorism attacks occurred on both sides.
The Second World War exploded, difficult to appreciate whether Hitler had emerged from the chains in which he had originally been held by bankers, or all that he had done, was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish State as a world community.
Israel was formally founded in 1948 and, as Germany was provoked by military reparations for World War II, the State of Israel was declared to create a fire of a third war.
If international bankers can solve it, the Jewish people, as well as in the second world war, will be victims of fighting on the front line, now with Arabic or, eagerly, the Muslim people of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of disagreement and chaos not only inside the country but also at the international level (only a sudden division of people into the parties and opponents of Israel).
Who is guilty, and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israel conflict, where the insult causes an infinite violent chain of violence, if it begins with the greed of individuals and their desire to the world's authority?
There is a need to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we have, international bankers are calling on people to vote in the elections exclusively of their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Yastreb Netayahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international banker, who is doing everything to start war with Iran, which, through the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to grow into a world conflict and, taking into account Iran's control of the Ormus Oil, which contains 20 per cent of all world stocks of oil (the corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light the words David Rockfeller said in 1994, "All we need is a common crisis, and people will take a new world order."
The new world order in their representation is the world of gods and slaves.
The world where the rest of the human population serves a bunch of financial aristocracy that enjoys comfort.
The world where each born organism is implanted by a chip with which it becomes an entirely controlled creature.
And he forces all the small and large, rich and poor, and the slaves to have on the right hand or on the forehead, so that a man who is not marked by the name of that beast or by the number of his name cannot buy or sell.
This is what wisdom is: anyone who has a mind can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of man, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
"Operation Argo," when there's nowhere worse, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamic demonstrant students captured the United States embassy in Teheran and hosted 52 diplomats.
They were to be released in exchange for the dismissed chess of Mohammed Reza Pehlevi, who fled after the revolution in the United States, which had been a protector of his regime for decades.
For the United States administration, it was not expected to afford a positive outcome of the situation -- it could not afford to throw a chess out of the board, because it could undermine the trust of allies in other countries.
However, the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to a theocratic regime, was unable.
This was a hit on the prestige of the United States, which was later strengthened by a failure to release hostages by force.
Detainees were finally released 444 days later, after negotiations with the intermediation of the Government of Algeria.
Their destiny caused a wave of solidarity and anti-arian mood at home.
The defeat in Iran has significantly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter at the 1980 presidential elections, ended by the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film by actor Ben Affleck, "Argo Operation" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought a small victory to America.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six employees were able to escape.
After complicated peripetts, they completed their way to the residential embassy of Canada.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, has been able to take them from Iran, with an extravagant cover legend that helped them travel through Canadian passports as members of the country's film team that were looking for a place to take off the scientific and fantastic era.
Genres combined
The plan designed by Tony Mendes ' evacuation expert required Hollywood's cooperation.
In order for the legend to be reliable, the specialized magazines wrote about the project of the film, the press conferences were organized, the invented production company had a real office.
Details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, a film based on Tony Mendez's memoars.
Afflek's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political triller, so-called film-kinoopus, a good story, an example of a number of Ouchen movies.
The film constantly modifies the moods -- on the one hand, the documented scenes from Teheran (the titres show the symbolic historical photos of events and how the same situations were shown in the film -- no big differences in it).
On the other hand, relieved Hollywood fragments crossed with irony and moderate examination.
And then the scenes from the ClA headquarters and other suits -- men in suits are discussing the situation at the tables of negotiations, on the stairs of institutions, on the phone...
Ben Afflek was greatly able to restart his career.
A ridiculous acter became a respected director, and his game stopped being a ridiculous object.
Operation Argo's third full-measured film, after dark detective " Goodbye, baby, bye " (2007) and triller " City " (2010).
At the same time, this is the first film of Afflek, which is not filmed in the hometown of the director Boston.
The sense of space atmosphere includes qualitys that raised the early films of the director over the Hollywood Standard.
And Afflek shows it in Argo, where Teheran plays Canada.
The best scenes in the film are on the streets when real events are reconstructed - the introductory scenes of the fall of the embassy are impressive by their clarity, which also transmits the emotions of confusion and unforeseenness that arise when history is suddenly changing.
The similar effect of Afflek and his colleagues is achieved in the fake headquarters in the Teheran market.
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the report did not imply a number of exciting movies.
He's working pretty successfully with this little one, sometimes he thinks that it's not so elegant (the scene in which the phone call in America prevents the coming crisis at the Teheran airport, and the race of the landing line looks quite elaborately).
The lack of Argo is the dissolution of the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood colleagues are really charming, but their characters would deserve greater space, and they're not the only ones in the movie.
Afflek's film lacks a little dramaticity, a film that can be viewed with moderate interest, assessing the performance and retro-style that rebuilds the trillers of the '70s.
But it's hard to find out.
However, it is enough to remind one, still in a known sense of living history, as well as to witness how the ideas of all-powered and all-knowing specialities have been overwhelmed.
Rules of suppression of airballs, bananas and circus
www.bankovnipoplatky.com, an annual survey on the most absurd banking gatherings, has now decided to announce a contest on “the most absurd decision or a project from the EU's workshop”.
“The latest event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of large European companies,” said the "Right" organizer of the questionnaire Patrick Nager.
Among the nomination of absurdities has already been the recent decision of the European Court of Auditors on the rate of insurance contributions for men and women.
Women have still had the benefits of life insurance because they are objectively less risked for insurance companies.
"The further unbelievable ideas from the EU's workshop can be made to the compete by the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place until the end of February 2013," said Nager.
The disputed orders of the EU include, for example, the mandatory addiction of biocomponents to fuel, resulting in damage to nature, and the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury scales only because they contain relatively small numbers of hazardous substances, or a chicken-size directive, which has resulted in significant travel of eggs this year.
The criticism has also been prohibited from using the term “button oil” or the exemption from the sale of classic lamps.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimeters long.
The general European apparatus has often made a decision under pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by a State or group of States (e.g., even under the threat of the vet, the demands of its banks are now in Brussels).
The interests of the lobby are: for example, the highest quality bananas in the European Union had to reach a length of 14 cm and were not daring to demonstrate " anonymous curve".
The European Commission, however, justified that it only harmonizes existing different national rules that complicated trade.
The EU, despite the opposition of some States, has mitigated the standards relating to fruit and vegetables, recalling that existing directives would lead to dissolving products.
The candidate for the survey may also be a last yearly EU decision, which requires that selling airballs be provided by warning that children under eight years can not be suppressed without adult care.
The EU has addressed the US research in which airballs in the game are the potential cause of death of children by choking.
This limitation is now extended to children up to 14 years of age, which are not allowed to push into fair ducks.
Funny ideas are born at home
It is also absurd enough to rule on European officials themselves: anyone who has any official position in the EU cannot, given the delicateness of the topic for Greece, use the name of Macedonia and should instead say "BURM" (Ex Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with liberal economies, the Banknoplatky.com " Principle of Non-Integration " (Laisses Faire) proposed a vote in addition to several of the above-mentioned absurd rules, such as the EU rules on the amount of food stocks in the territory of the Member State.
The EU has established the maximum amount of food stocks that may be in the Czech Republic on the date of its entry into the European Union.
Subsequently, Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the amounts of conserved mushrooms, which threatened her great fines.
The questionnaire organizers were also interested in paying to some countries that had no sea, and the idea of granting grants for the application for grants.
But these ideas came up in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We are in an uncomfortable situation because we don't have a sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation," said then the Minister of Agriculture, Yaroslav Palas, in autumn 2004.
As a argument, he indicated that there had been high grain crops in the country, and as a result of so-called intervention procurement, the State had the full stocks that had to be delivered.
For the fact that Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission met the Czech Republic, organizing a tender for procurement of grain from countries that have no way to sea.
The subsidies for the receipt of the grant were invited to the villages of the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Paul Germany (US-DEU), in particular, to make a statement for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Remarkable orders are an exception
While the decisions in the Member States are easily criticized, the efforts of the EU to regulate and to improve the functioning and development of the European Union, many experts believe that they deserve more recognition.
The serious problem, according to experts, is the acquisition of EU grants for projects that have no intention of any inclusion in European integration, however, which have been achieved by Member States in the budget.
It calls on emotions among the Czechs and that, as in other countries of the European Union, the Czech Republic should fight in Brussels for the right to identify its traditional products, not always winning in this competition.
Although the Czech Republic, after six years of fighting with the Germans and the Austrians, maintained the name "Olomouque garlic", however, the "Tuerland Rome" traditions in our country were rooted in the 19th century, our producers had to be renamed "Tutherland".
Roma can be called only products from a berries distillate, not of sugar beam.
In the official list of EU registered products, along with the worldly known cheese " feta" and "gorgondzole", the Marcipan from German Lubeck or the Parm hut, had already been found, for example, carlovarian sugars, hillish and threshold rock and yellow chomel.
The EU's trademark may also be proud of the pardubian spray and the gorgic pipes.
People want me to protect the republic, but I'm a fan, says Ocamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man get into his mind to be president?
I'm not thinking about being a senator or president myself.
If we had all worked out in the country without trouble, I wouldn't have been balloting anywhere.
But I can't see how the country's been screwing up in the last 20 years, how the thieves are sick, people increase taxes and retirement ages.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, I'm trying to figure out how to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and I'm an independent person without any party, I have no other possibility to influence things but to act as a senator or president.
You got to the Senate, but soon you went to the presidential castle.
Do you not turn your back to those who have chosen you?
I kept saying that I would be involved in the fight for the presidential castle depending on the results of the elections in the Senate.
Later, I stated that if I was elected as a senator, I would be president.
My goal is not a position; the post is a tool that I can exercise my views.
Therefore, I need the greatest influence and the widest powers.
But it's not just that we're like a nation, we're in a bar or a TV, but we're willing to get anyone who's gonna try to change something.
This is added to the media that distracts people and confuses freedom of speech with freedom of lie.
For example, I was told that I was bribeing journalists, or that I was the advisor of Irji Paroubek.
Let's go to your views.
The fight for the Presidential Castle began with those on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and reverse property declarations above twenty million.
In order to implement this, the law must be amended.
You don't have such powers as a president, and only a whole senate can offer laws.
What do you want to do with this?
When I was a citizen, I was lobbying to make the excursion a free business, it was successful.
The problem is politics -- when someone comes with a good proposal on the left or on the right, it is deliberately obstacled, and it prevents citizens.
As an independent impartial person, I have much greater capacity to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My privilege is that I can take what is best for our country without the party's shape, without looking at the doctrines, and apply it.
Do you think you're a man more pertinent to the right or to the left?
From the Czech perspective, I feel like people are referring to me rather to the left.
It doesn't matter to me at all -- a little left or a little right.
It's important for me to go forward.
It's not about someone's right, but someone to the left, I want to join people together.
I will always support any good decision for the society whether it will be proposed by the CPC or GDP, and I will also be opposed to the bad idea.
You're angry when someone says you're a populist.
But do you not prove that by what you said?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have some perfect goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get closer.
It can be called populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already functioning in the world, or the visible experts speak of them.
But without parliamentary support, you will only have sloungs.
And that's the policy you won't last long.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to carry out criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have any other possibility.
Only to persuade politicians, journalists and the public and to try to convert them to our own side so that we can achieve our own.
If I had been elected as President, there would be no problem organizing a direct television broadcast in which I would call to the chairmans of parliamentary parties with a call to legalize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, public officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they will, if they refuse, have to report why they do not want to do so.
If there is a strong personality that sounds abuse, there will be pressure on the political scene.
Take the president's direct elections -- it was a public pressure.
I'm just saying I'm a lover, not a genius, not an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies to stand up to my beliefs and views.
I'm just a politician, and for my programme I'm trying to get the support of the majority.
I'm trying to move on my own; if it doesn't work, I'll finish in six years and return to the private sector.
It sounds partially as if Ocamura had to save Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not gonna do anything alone, so I went through a number of famous people with a proposal to make a ballot at the Senate.
I went to Radim Janchure, and he refused to do a lot of work.
I also supported the leading investigation of journalist Jan Lorenz, who discovered fraud with light fuel products.
I made my candidacy because people are really unsatisfactory, but now I feel at weight.
Sixty per cent of people did not go to elections, but most of those who had gone have chosen representatives of the execution.
We're only two independent in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate to make changes difficult.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my views, for example, for direct elections of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about the foundation of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the purity of the past of each potential party, and I don't have money for it.
There's no money for the presidential campaign, only twenty thousand crowns on my transparency account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, but what's your own business with that?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have an area in Prague worth approximately 25 million, a 10 million apartment, another apartment of 8 million, a collection of art productions for approximately 10 million, the Aston-Martin of 3.5 million, and the Superb Scotch for a million, and a few more million accounts.
By the way, Aston-Martin showed up because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who was driving on the car, was galanteous with women, and at the same time fighting against pervert and lawlessness.
You drive to Aston Martin, you own 60 million property and you don't have any money for a campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for a campaign.
Do I have to go into debts?
I've already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors is that my program is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign from my pocket.
The campaign costs will actually cover me by the senator's salary.
But I wouldn't have lived for that money, for example, I couldn't pay my son for English school, which is worth 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't have been balloting anywhere.
So you're going to do business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd shorten this activity?
But it doesn't depend on the salary size.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activity.
For example, the director of the spring tourism agency will be my deputy.
People would like me to be a silver man to keep the republic.
But I have to live for something too.
How much have you been used to getting a month as an entrepreneur?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I get on.
And if I had become a president, I would have finished my business.
You'll find a full interview in the Saturday newspaper right.
MVRDV architects prove that these adventures are not only in imagination, such as Spekenis and its recently built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"This building seems fun to me, it looks futuristic, finally we can see something interesting again," says Lisette Verheig on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in a large company nearby, says, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I wonder, why do we want another library today?
Everyone has Internet, iPad and electronic books.
No one is voluntary now to go to such old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spekenisse, a small bedroom town under Rotterdam, belongs to an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to combat this awkward circumstances, several years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and to build seven inventory bridges, which were represented in euro banknotes, as a painted thumbnail from the railway.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the fathers of the city realized that they had the only way to overcome the statistics: to build a library here!
Vini Maas from the Rotterdam Architecture Bureau of MVRDV, the master of brave columns and the author of clever, sometimes even cynical buildings, took place with its common insult and appeared at a competitive audience in 2003 with five books under mouse and smile on his face.
And while the jury's members looked around and squeezed by their shoulders, the drunk Maas put a piramida out of his original gift of size and finished the speech to protect his project with the following words: "Dear towns!"
That's what I'm saying, "The Book Mountain" in Speakenis, so-called Buchenberg!
After nine years, the mountain was worth 30 million euros.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes the underground garage, the supermarket, the mail and several resident housing houses and townhouses for 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Book Mountain was noted by the second prize of the Netherlands' Best Library 2012.
The project is also participating in the 2012 National Dutch Competition of Tree Facilitys.
Thus, the unlike cities that could have before offered nothing but a post-modernist pedestrian zone and a remarkably unbelievable warrior, whose white facials are imposed on the thought of the milk factory, became richer on one modern architecture.
But the most important thing is that the first public building of cultural appointment in Spekenis appeared in the history of the city.
Long Way to the Book
The first impression is that the book Eldorado is under a cheese collapse.
There is only one elevator in the centre of the mountain massive, since the actual architecture and reading fans would prefer to explore this area by walking.
The boiled room from all sides is a light and light, light, burned tube floors and elegant street lamps make a sense of public city square.
The city environment is perfectly regenerated.
The look is unwillingly looking for champions, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
"The book sheets are usually standing along the fasads, and there is a large dark hall in the middle, usually uncomfortable and unlikely," says Vini Maas.
We put a classic space configuration on the head and pulled out a zone for reading from inside.
The internal area of the book mountain has been used skillfully: offices, libraries, chess clubs, environmental centres and technical facilities are located in the centre.
The black book sheets, which serve as the walls, are especially happy, are parapets, stairs.
Their species, the texture and the smell are unusual.
Even experiencing architects and construction engineers are losing guessing what the unknown material is.
"We have tried to work with secondary materials," explains Jop Trauborst, a project manager representing the Spakenisse community, in accordance with the standard requirements.
And once at one agricultural company in Frisland, we met the appropriate side product of agriculture.
For many years in the heats and fields in the Netherlands, the artificial fibre thickness material has been used.
It's cheap and saves time.
The thin textile serves one or two seasons, and then it can be thrown out.
For the library, this is the first time in such volumes -- a thick, four centimeters thick in a panel.
Under the heat and pressure, the so-called landbauplastic (KLP) is transformed into a dark, single, solid material, a little scent like a new car and a little crossing.
There are 105 degrees to the top.
The one who can reach the road of nearly 500 meters will be rewarded in the literary cafeteria not only with a fantastic view of the city but also with Dutch croquets and wood ficuses in the garments.
They care about the atmosphere, and in particular about the right wetness of air on the literary mountain.
Expenditure for a New Spirit
"It is hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is a model project in the environment," said Trouborst.
The heat and cooling of the earth are used.
Although the Book Mountain stands under a glass wave, even in the clear days the sun gets inside for a little while.
The wide farms of a sticked wood, which are located perpendicularly in a glass facade, give shadow and take on most of the sunlights.
The climate in the room is very nice.
The rest of the protection is provided by the total automatic ruling curtains.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above, had already visited the new library.
Lisette Verheig was here too.
Also a teacher of the traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogard, who called Buchenberg "the soul of Spekeniss, which was long missing".
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to offer one book from his own congregation.
These books had to take empty places on the sheets yet not fully compiled library -- at that time there were 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The sheets are upstairs.
"Nothing worse than a half-free library," said architect Vinnie Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, each inhabitant is now in some way linked to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it only serves for decoration.
Thus, the MVRDV has been able to solve the royal task, which is called the creation of identities in the professional gargone.
Spekenisse wrote his literary story.
And let them be very young and not educated.
It's just a starting point to build identity.
Sabo: “Germans should play a more important role”
Germany abstained from the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, a United States-European link expert, in doing so, Berlin balances the narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinian application for the status of observer to the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained from voting.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelites in Gaza.
Germany must now be careful about its special relations with Israel.
At the same time, I believe that it also does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, not being too critical to Israel.
During the rebellion in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the vote on the introduction of a prohibited flight zone.
The NATO subsequently implemented the proposal.
Is Germany difficult to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
It is the fact that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, from the policy that, as it is said, led by the United States, to its own German foreign policy.
Furthermore, the situation is complicated by the lack of a harmonised single policy.
Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just incorporating their role, but they're on their way to "more normal" foreign policy.
External policy that France or Britain conducts.
What does the "normal" foreign policy specifically mean in Germany?
It is willing to take a position in its national interests, regardless of the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policies, i.e. exports and links with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are significantly different from the interests of other major States, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests affect the position in the Middle East and the UN voting?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the States of the Persian Gulf.
It must therefore be cautious to avoid insulting the public and elite in Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its role.
But I wouldn't give it too much importance, it's not a completely unilateral connection.
In any case, this plays an important role in the accounting of the Germans.
Did Germany harm its relations with the United States by refraining from making important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States the understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don't think it was as dramatic as in the Libyan matter.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
This signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that it should be considered with its interests.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the contrary, the United States stated clearly for the veto.
Is there a distinction between the United States and many European States?
Such differences have always existed because of the American internal policy.
I believe that the Obama Government deeply understands the European position.
However, in connection with the local political situation, the Government, of course, cannot take such a position openly.
I believe that substantial differences in views are not as significant as they always seem.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, you will note that Obama is not admired by the policies of Netanjahu.
Is it easy for Germany to combine their close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, and the situation of the EU's most important partner with the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be a little easier if there was a single, uncontrollable European policy, but now it is not.
Therefore, they cannot speak within a broader approach and have to act instead, based only on their own vision of the situation.
That's exactly what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future, Germany will take a leading role in developing a common European position.
It is clear that it is difficult for Germany, at least because of the relationship with Israel.
This theme was always a thick one.
But I think the Germans are clear that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it not take a really major role?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany has not yet been used to this, she is still uncomfortable, and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis -- every time Germany plays an important role, various anti-Germany feelings are manifest.
The Germans are not just dealing with it.
It's actually an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this regard, Germany is much more difficult than the United States.
It should take into account the various neighbors and views, which is not easy.
So the United States' influence in European policy is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU is not filling this vacuum, and who remains?
The Germans just have to play a more important role.
Even if you don't like it, it's unpleasant, or it makes you more unloved, such a life!

Trade Marks Protection in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-known trade mark, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is an officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with companies from whose names it is formed.
Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the original names have filed a complaint.
But then it is clear whether they will be able to stand up for their rights.
"The foreigners are increasingly difficult to protect their trade marks in China," said Thomas Patloch, a lawyer of Taylor Wessing, specializing in violations of trade marks in the Far East.
On my desk every week, it appears on a new case of this kind.
The imitators are sufficient to add only a few letters to obtain the right to register their trade marks.
This is how Gucci produces Lu-Gucci, and you can register Prada-Kny instead of Prad.
The German enterprises, such as the manufacturer of Puma sports goods, are legally copied.
Patloch opens a folder with registration records in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, the Chinese company registered a trade mark of Zegna DF Puma, a artificial name in which the name of the Fashion House of Ermenegildo Zegna was also used.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions for copying and violating intellectual property rights is known.
In large cities, there are multidimensional universities that sell almost exclusively fakes.
However, Patloch's cases are not such, but, on his trustees, he objected that Chinese enterprises were fully officially receiving the registration of goods marks from the office to use the name that has already been protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call it "ban minpai", a passenger mark.
This word is associated with "ban daquan".
That's what they call women hunting for rich men.
Chinese authorities do not accept guilt
"It hurts business, it is necessary to fight," believed Patloch.
"The trade mark is washed, the unique situation is lost, the image suffers very much."
Financial losses and process costs in affected sectors are calculated by millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China, sales of 15 billion euros per year, is the third in size and the fastest growing market of luxury items.
However, removal of suspicious records in the trade mark registry is difficult, and it is expensive.
The process may take up to nine years, with a clear outcome.
Patloch explains the cases in which the court rejected the complaints, since after a long time the contested name became the "reality of the market".
If the prosecutor is unfortunate, he will even have to pay the plagiator because he has damaged his trade mark in China, said Patloch.
Sometimes the jungle's law runs here.
There are also famous cases on graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a judicial dispute with the manufacturer of construction machines, Sany, a company that shortly before acquired the company of the Putzmeister concrete producer.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use a symbol similar to the Mercedes Star.
The Volvo company Geely originally used a blue-white logo that was like BMW; the process was successful, and Geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of fashion products, Lacoste, lost in China the imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, with a famous crocodile looked on the other hand.
Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The recording of CCTMO marks in Beijing confirms that in 2010, the lack of staff and facilities had a problem.
But last year, "return from emergency in the working process to normal."
Thus, the number of unproducted objections decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81.500 claims still await production in the office.
It's worth fighting it.
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million trade marks claims were received in CTMO, almost a third of which were more than in 2010.
This record and means that China has led a list of new registrations throughout the world ten times in order, reports the department.
The same applies to the total number of real trade marks, only 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion of juana collections were paid.
If simplified, this means that each registration is worth an average of 1280 Yuanas or 160 euros.
It is worth a multiplication, as indicated in the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the concern has been fighting the Chinese plagiator.
The Germans have achieved that illicit production of fake vehicle details has been eliminated.
However, the imitator strengthened Chinese rights to Freudenberg's trade mark.
This was its own failure, since the names in Germany were not protected, said Hannah Ventzler, chairman of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in München.
The CTMO registration office rejected the München claim.
True, in both of the following instances, Freudenberg won, but the opposite side continues to fight so far.
We need to be cautious
The issue is now under consideration in the Supreme Court.
Ventzler is hoping to bring the case to a good end and praise the professionalism of courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive, and it takes us a lot of time, money and nerve."
The company's archive had to review even the acts of the centuries ago to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg ultimately proposed the opposite party " a large six-digit amount in euro " for settlement.
"It makes it clear how expensive it is," said Ventzler.
The dangers of the Far East are threatened to turn even to Europe.
This is where imitators register unprotected trade marks.
Thus, a Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register Freudenberg's name for shoes and skin products.
The concern has long ceased production in these areas, but, despite this, it has been able to prevent registration.
"You need to be careful," said Ventzler.
Both him and Patloch's lawyer recommend that German enterprises be very careful with China.
Not enough to rely on international provisions on the protection of trade marks, rather, foreigners should “all that is worth protecting, registering in China,” said Ventzler.
Otherwise, it could cost much more than a registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trade mark drama, the opposite party will have to pay the licence collections for its own name, explained Ventzler.
Otherwise, we'll be pulled out of the market in a dispute segment.
World AIDS Day: plugging, singing, helping
In Heidenberg, the Imbongi Choir is rehearsed in Swaziland, and AIDS orphans are rejoiced with it.
A history of relations over the distance of more than 8733 miles.
At first, cowboy boots, basketball cruises, ladies boats and male paws pick a tact on the parking floor and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only after that, the voices of singers are slowly growing - alte, bass, tenor and soprano - they are coming, charming and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old director, almost jumps out of his mother's shoes when he leads them with flexible and explicit gestures.
Monday night, in the musical hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Hayalberg, the Imbongi Choir is rehearing a new song.
Fifty people from 23 to 69, from human genetic experts to the palace, attended the exercise.
"Om'Obanni" is an easy thing, every voice of people has its own text, and in a completely foreign language: Zulus, in which 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesoto, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland speak.
Assistance for self-help
According to Unaids, United Nations programmes to Combat AIDS, around 34 million HIV-infected in the world are estimated.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, there is 245,000 orphans of AIDS.
More than 40 per cent of the HIV population are positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitani, the association of Voices for Africa found heads in Germany.
70 of them attends a school that is preparing for further training.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, headship can be taken.
It guarantees the child's money for school, school shape and daily hot lunch in the Gogo Centre.
Imbongi in Zulus means a storyteller or a praiser.
They're not talking about running on the band, but they can sing.
Almost ten years the choir is studying songs in this mild language and sometimes even brings them back to the first place they appeared in South Africa.
Because at the distance of 8733 miles of the flight from Hayeilberg, northwest of the Swaziland, there is a village of Esitjan, which depends on the votes of the German people.
Forty per cent infected
There are about 2,000 people, some still in simple cabins of clay and slam, many children among the inhabitants.
More than 300 of them left without their parents who died of the HIV virus.
The miniature reflects the disease of all Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world on UNICEF data.
The extreme body circumcision of men, which has proved to reduce half the risk of infection, is almost not accepted among the population.
More than 40 per cent of the Swaziland population are carrying an immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth tenth is not rare.
Hor opened this village on a joint journey to Africa in the spring 2005, but first, the Imbogani participants saw a number of children on the streets lacking not only parental care, but just food, clothing, education.
Without school education, a man in the poor country has no chance.
At first, it was a private obligation for individual participants -- a few euros per year to send the child to school and to give him the opportunity to receive hot food once a day.
However, a year later, the choir established a "Voices for Africa " , which has since been almost professionally concerned about AIDS orphans in Esitzen.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial PPP includes siphilis, chlamidiosis and tripper (gonoreum).
Partially viral IPPPs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
The skull pediculasis and frequency refer to parasite PPPs.
What are the mainly affected groups?
Siphilis and gonorea are met mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Institute of Robert Koha is based on the fact that at least four of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have been transferred as a result of sexual contacts between men.
Heterosexual adults often experienced sexually transmitted diseases include chlamidial infections, trihomonias, candidosis (mouth), gonorea and human papiloma virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of the new HIV infections are in this group.
Clamidia infections are commonly encountered among youths than among other population groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections are affected by young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
We also have human papilloma virus in youth.
How is the number of infections changing?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
Siphilis, according to the Institute of Robert Koh, had doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been reduced since 2007.
In 2011 there were approximately 2700 cases.
It's about one tenth less than last year.
What symptoms indicate the venus disease?
Infected diseases may occur in genitals, complaints on urinement, disposal, pain at the bottom of the stomach, and bubbles or clothing.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms are capable of reducing the risk of infection, but do not give 100 per cent protection.
In fact, partially sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread by contact infection and in close physical contact.
The experts therefore recommend regular surveys, especially in the frequent exchange of sexual partners.
In early diagnosis, the majority of PPPs can be healed and avoided remote consequences.
The headship, donations, and not the latest privileges for people all over Germany are allowed to gather something.
"We have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjan," said Annette Lennartz, chairman of the United Nations.
In the village itself, there are money from Germany, Codva Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also cares for orphans to be well built, for example, with one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as called in the Zulus old women, is a village resistance.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their head and make sure that children in shape every day appear at a time.
Those who don't have a family are in the shelter to Hanisil, a single woman who receives a remuneration salary, as well as two cookings that prepare for more than 200 hungry children every day.
Furthermore, the merger " Voices for Africa " organized a shieving school, built two chickens, and together with the US Health Organization, PSI organized an HIV analysis for many villages.
It is difficult to imagine, but the disease that is so obvious throughout the country prefers deep silence.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolute tabu," said Annette Lennartz, "because it is related to sexuality."
It is quite unusual for a country in which the king has officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love for excessiveness.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, it is also guilty of such an authorized State ' s lifestyle that the HIV virus has spread so quickly in the past years.
But it also lies on wandering workers who carry the virus across the country.
The free condoms are literally on every corner, says Anne Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
Another culture is flesh to flesh."
In order to support a cultural exchange, Ibmogni is traveling every two or three years in South Africa and singing songs, sorrows, war spirits, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many in the south edge of the black continent have known since apartheid.
The bus full of white singing songs in black - not only brings good mood and joy, but even the tears have occurred in the eyes of severe borderers.
The journey is always accompanied by Esitjan, where singers visit subheading children.
Although a small village can hardly be found on the map, it is more than known in the Eculveni Valley.
"Go to Esitani, there's light," people here say.
And after a 8733-kilometer flight back to Hayeilberg, when singers go back to the rehearsal hall in Bergheimer Street, you can see that the light is also burning here.
Messenger: NASA opens ice on Mercury
Sonda Messenger found evidence that there is ice on the Mercury planet.
The ice shelter may have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The U.S.A. Space Department has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closer to the sun, there is also freezing water, as shown in three studies published on Thursday in the Special Science magazine.
The Messenger Zond found evidence that the region of the planet was constantly covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 inches, or perhaps 20 metres.
Apparently, the water comes from comets or perhaps asteroids facing Mercury.
No one links the ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the scientific leader of the sonda, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury may reach 426 degrees of Celsia.
However, these openings could help explain how water and other building elements of life have gotten into other places of the Solar System.
The inhabitants of the Earth of sonda, telescopes and small robots, such as Phoenix, are investigating the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the Earth: small windows into infinite daily.
The image is from the camera developed by German researchers from Max Plank Institute.
Eight planets of our Solar System, as well as the Cerera corn planet.
Like Pluton, who turns around the Sun for Neptune, Cerera, on the new definition of the 2006 international astronomical union, is not "paid".
This fragment of the Infrared Telescope "Spitzer" represents a "family portrait" of unbroken generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue points, the harder to identify in the star circle pink-born stars.
This area of star education, the scientists, unromanticly call it W5, is opened by Spitzer in the constellation of Cassiopea, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This transfusioned fever of the dying star photographed NASA Spitzer telescope.
It looks like a pony ring consists of the material that the star threw out during the dying process.
In the giant mist of Trifid, away from Earth by 5400 light years, new stars emerged from gas and dust.
NASA Spitzer telescope made this picture of the galaxy birth hall.
The Star Bunch of the Pleyada, also called Seven Seven sisters, can be seen at night with an unarmed eye.
Of course, the color telescope is better.
How the red eye blinks to the observer the Fog on this infrared picture.
It is located at the distance of 700 light years in the constellation of Water.
The co-ordination with the earthly continent brought this fog nickname, North America.
The combination of a normal and infrared photo provides a clear flower.
This new star in all the beauty could be photographed only with infrared telescope sensors Spicer.
Saturn and his rings: how they emerged is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Maybe it's the parts of Saturn's moon, which disappeared inherently 4,5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and most clear pictures of the Habble Telescope: Watergate
Depending on the flower, the spiral galaxies are transformed into these artwork.
The photograph published by the Southern Observatory shows the trifid fog in the Arrow's constellation for several thousand light years.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (triple, three parts), since the dark dust bars split into three parts of the heart of the star collar.
In the Snake Star, astronomers took pictures of the outer collapse: 400 million light years from the Earth of the two mergering galaxies are encountered and inevitablely facing each other.
This is the birth of the star, the Habble, took off in the M83 spiral galaxy.
The person who does not like technical reductions may call it the name of the South Trust Wheel.
The photo of the space telescope "Habble" shows the fragment of Iris' mist in the conservation of Cephea.
The fog from 1400 light years consists of particles of dust, which are 10 to 100 times smaller than the normal domestic dust.
This picture was made of optical and X-ray photos of various telescopes.
It shows a black hole ring removed by 430 million light years from the Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 photographed a space telescope Habble for NASA.
The large spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This star fog is the brightest group of new stars in our Milk Way.
The star collar constantly creates new stars.
This star cloud, connected to the Fog of Rosetta, also constantly creates new stars, at a distance of 5000 light years from the Earth.
There is no dust in this bright galaxy with a small black hole, but gas.
Researchers suggest that it occurred shortly before the Great Explosion, when hydrogen was mainly in the universe.
Our Views to the Universe: Important Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgeem, even before Galileo Galileo came to watch the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become more and their views of space are increasingly available.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope in the Observatory of Palomar in San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S., there is a large binocular telescope.
It allows to look into space with two mirrors, each diameter of 8.4 meters.
"Gran Telescopio Canarias" has a giant internal device - a diameter of only one mirror is 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Greater South African Telescope in South Africa is segmented to reduce cost.
Nevertheless, it reaches approximately 11 meters in the diameter.
Insufficient deficiencies of inexpensive constructive performance: the telescope is strictly attached under the vertical angle, which limits its movement.
The Hobby-Aberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
His characteristics: high lighting ability.
It reaches, despite a relatively small mirror, the parameters of the largest world telescopes.
With a radio telescope in Aresibo (Puerto Rico) researchers are listening to alien signals in space.
Radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Participating in the " Search for Alien Intelligence " project (SETI), any owner of the computer can help by providing its calculation power.
A view to the observatory of the European astronomical Service (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
This is the "Very large telescope" that is in full corresponding to its name.
Its four mirrors allow lighting in the visual pipe even the average infrared spectrum.
The Chile Observatory of the ESO also plans a European " Very Great Telescope" installation.
The main mirror should be divided into a total of 42 meters and will be composed of almost 1,000 mirrors.
However, photographs should be expected not earlier than 2018.
Until 2007, both Kake telescopes were considered the largest of the world in the Hawaii volcano of Mauna Kea.
They have two mirrors in diameter of ten meters.
The Kek telescopes are composed of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which is also looking into the sky with the Subar and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope must appear on Mountain Kea, with a mirror diameter of 30 meters.
They can enjoy the illustration here.
However, the most important outer space species have been placed by the Habble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, he has drawn pictures of remote worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for planets outside the Solar System, especially those where life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1235 candidates were discovered from the beginning of the mission.
The photo is sealed by the latest preparations of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The space telescope of James Webb (JWST) will be sent to space not earlier than 2018 on the Arian 5 missile.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope is that it must be in the light of the first stars and galaxies to look for the Great Explosion.
Scientists suggest that there is ice on the south of Mercury.
However, there is no credible data on this, since Messenger is turning closer to the northern field of the planet.
The workers for decades indicated that there was ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the 2004 Messenger Sonde, the first to turn around Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink oil every day and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many inhabitants reach the Bible’s respectful age.
There's even a long-term museum.
Finding a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many inhabitants reach the Bible’s respectful age.
There's even a long-term museum.
Finding a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
The journey through the Talush Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
The microautobus, with groaning, is flying the road along the thick hills, storms, and simple farm houses.
Everything around is so green and bright that you can think you're in Schwarzwald.
But this is the southern edge of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few miles away.
This is where they live -- one of the peoples of Caucasus, who know little about, except that they are beautifully speaking in farsi and Azerbaijan, and are different by the long-term.
The final item is Lerick.
The small town is scattered by a too heavy architecture of the Soviet times, which is incompatible with the painting mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe are barely arriving here, the road from the Azerbaijan capital of Baku is too tired.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers, since the road has only one line.
Legendary wealth to which the country owes oil to the Caspian Sea here, to the province until it arrived.
However, Pilate Fatulaev (48) believes that there is something to interest tourists in Lerico.
"In May, Baku was celebrated by the Eurovision song festival - and next year we will have the festival of the senior people of the world," said Fatulaeva.
She is the director of the long-term museum, probably the only one in the world.
There is an documented biography of about eight dozen threads from these places, which are over 100 years old, and the Fatulaeva indicates a black and white photograph.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old here.
When he was 136 years old, he was born with another child
However, the museum’s controversial star is the Shirali Muslumov chaban, who appears to be 168 years old.
The birth testimony, however, did not.
And given that the older person whose age is confirmed by the documents was fulfilled in 122 years of age, the age of Muslummov was very doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," explained Fatulaeva.
A man was married three times, and he had 23 children, at 136 years of age, he seemed to have a daughter.
Did the Muslim chicken add a few dozen years to his age?
Because even Rembrandt Sholz, a researcher of age at Max Plank Institute in Rostock, heard about long residents in Central Asia.
"Amazingly many people of the old age can also be met in some areas of China, Japan, or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," said Sholz, "in Sardinia also live very many very old people."
However, due to the lack of documents, scientific confirmation of age could not be possible because there were no registries of civil status.
Box of warm butter every day
Nevertheless, there is a fact that people in the area of Leric often reach the Bible’s age.
Now there are 20 people older than 100 years.
Why are there so many people in the south?
The Azerbaijan exhibitor of Farid Muhimzade explains this with special genes of tall.
The director of the Fatulajev Museum believes it's a matter of food.
The tallies love meat, bread, and most of the milk products, many drink on a glass of warm butter every day, but it is unlikely that such high - calorie diet can be healthy from a dietological perspective.
Or is the original lifestyle that keeps human youth?
When she was 97, she was still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzaeva, who claims that she has 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, typical for the whole Caucasian region.
She's sitting on the floor with a barrel of butter without tiredness.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one of the sons and daughters of Mirzaev, who have their grandchildren long ago.
Two babies will also jump around here.
In the kitchen the guests are cooking tea in typical puzzled armoid glasses.
Mirzae's perfectly equal and strong white teeth, she hides long dark blond hairs that her son has opened up proudly to us.
I've always had my hair with milk, so they never dropped and kept the color.
"And I've never used the shampoon," Mirzaeva said.
Monthly Retirement Available
She's always eating only what grew up in her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, potatoes.
I've never been buying food in the store for my life.
Then she tells me about her husband, who served in the army.
It was most difficult after World War II.
But it's been better when Heidar Aliev's "loved father" came up to the wheel.
The propaganda does not sound often in the speech of an old woman.
However, the cult around the nation's father, which ruled by the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan, almost no borders.
He was in power until 2003, and then his son Ilham took the rulership.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijan old men.
Mirzaev receives a monthly retirement (e.g. the same amount of euro) as a retirement for local conditions is the amount for which you can live well.
And perhaps a long-term son of Mirzaev's right too: "The old people in our culture have deep respect."
They live in a large family, loved, surrounded by care and happy.
There is no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word “human right” is not in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstration in Cairo demonstrates the deep diversity of the country.
The future constitution based on a shariate has faced a violent resistance.
The Egyptian President did not go to the paphos.
We have to create a transition.
"And his success is on my responsibility to the people and to God," he said in the public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but primarily to Christian kopts, liberals, educated Muslims and non - religious Egyptians.
For all of them, yet unbelievable in the opposition, are fearless.
Fear of a religious State in Nile on the mercy of the mighty Brothers Muslim.
Mohammed Mursey, nearly apologizing, said that he had suspended the constitutional court's competence and extended his competence "to save the revolution."
However, the 61-year-old engineer, a doctor of the U.S. University of Southern California, really wanted to save, not clearly, the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles have been carried out in a 15-hour night jump with obstacles to the Islamic Constitutional Assembly of 100 participants, which partially causes concerns.
As in the previous constitution, the draft states that the proceedings are based on the " principles of Islamic Law".
But what does "principles" mean?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and it could be feared that Islamists would use a stricter formulation and a legal lift in connection with it for a more strict interpretation of the sharia.
At least one new article suggests that all cases relating to the sharia should be attracted to the Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic agency of the country that has great authority in all the Sunnith Islam.
This should not, but it may mean that the clergy is supervising the law that de facto would result in the restriction of the judiciary.
In the draft Constitution, many are the subject of interpretation
Another problem is that civilians must remain accused of the military court.
Those courts during the period of Mubaraka served to suppress opponents.
After the dictator was deprived of military detention, up to 11,000 civilians.
As stated in the project, the State should protect the “real substance of the Egyptian family” and “continue its morals and values”.
It was legally so incorporated that public institutions could even control the content of the movies and literature through this article.
The open text means nothing but censorship.
In fact, none of the articles sets a direct equality of men and women.
But another prohibits insulting and dishonoring the prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is insult and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
Suspicious also appears to be a word that is prohibited by “human offence”.
Is it enough for the president's cartoons or jokes about law enforcement?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in the draft, which Mursey proposed for signature and which, he said, " very soon" would be submitted to the Egyptians at the referendum.
"Revolution has returned."
The opposition against the superiority of Islamist has been formed for several weeks.
Thousands of thousands of people gathered in an unusual one night on the Tahrir Square in Cairo and swore to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took third place at presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize Laureat and the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed El-Baradea, stated that the Constitution ' s project ' s " waste of history " .
Through the Short News Service, he accused Mursey's commitment to lead the "path against democracy".
"If he announces a referendum, we go to his palace and throw it away," said oppositionist Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not been revenged," the Egyptian media of the opposition policy of Haleda Ali quoted.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would make it incorrect.
"The Quran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Brothers Muslimans, in turn, called for a opposite demonstration, but, from precaution, not on the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer in the other coast of Neil before the Cairo University.
It participated in a large number of women under covers and salaphites who cried: “The people require the application of the law of God.”
They demanded Mursey: "Clean the country!" and assured, "The Quran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic area where it started has provoked a situation of practically civil war.
Mursey's followers obviously did not want to take this risk.
The Muslim brothers stated that both the opponents and the constitution members of the draft constitution have expressed themselves loudly and clear.
Now it is time for the people to decide from the electoral urna, in which direction the country should go.
Most of the Islamist project, this is considered a decisive case.
"The " human rights" is not mentioned once"
Hafiz Abu Saed in anger from this forced constitutional process, which was actually to last until February with all the public forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (ECPR) protected the Brothers Muslimman when they sat in prison or represented before the court at Mubarak.
Not because he divided their sight, but because the human rights are unseekable for him.
He was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now, the words "human rights" are never met in a new constitution, he regrets in a conversation with "Welt am Sontag".
The empowerment of Mursey's influence on all three branches of power in the State disappoints a lawyer.
These measures are obvious impacts on the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civil state, the President de facto cancelled it," Sayed regrets.
Because without civil society organizations, democracy cannot work.
Sayeda feels that everyone left him, even the international community, who is looking at the ideological fight against Nile's directions with a mix of curiosity and tension.
That could be the payoff.
The demonstrator on the Tahrir Square warns, "You create a monster that you can't control."
Norwegian rafisk: the badest smelling fish in the world?
The five million Norway population has one of the highest living levels not only in Europe but also in the world.
Perhaps the secrecy of the country's success has something to do with local addiction to an extremely violent fisherman's meal?
Take some of the cheese that's overdose.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You'll have a scent of rafish, one of the most famous Norwegian delicates.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but there's an inexpensive scent in the air.
Rakfisk is a flour that is salted and wandered in water up to a year, depending on what kind of batch should be achieved.
As the darkness is cold and dark, the Norwegian crowds are gathering for the Fagerness festival, which is devoted to it, we will say so to the exciting meal.
"It is eaten by raw and spied with a rum of aquavite, a local dark vodka," explains Howard Halvarsen, a local firefighter in the profession and a “Racfisk General” communities, which runs the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat fish cut by small cubes and spit it with a lot of drinking.
"Someone likes aquavite more than a rafisk," says Howard.
This drink is capable of breaking the smell.
I'm trying a couple of pieces.
If you can take a piece under your nose, it's not so bad — it's little different from the drought you've been driving in the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product of totally different times, times of poverty, when, before the refrigerators appear, the fish was slaughtered in hermeticly closed barrels with salt water.
Then, in a deep winter, when the fish was well and substantially polluted, it was extracted and absorbed by alcoholic perception was used in food.
In memory of the past generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and to emigrate mainly in the United States.
The population is now rapidly growing - more than 13 per cent of the immigrants who are drawn from jobs, high wages and the developed social security system.
Sweden’s residents (a long rival and not so long ago and much more reliable neighbors) have a massive arrival.
Rakfisk is considered an important symbol, unchanged, although a few of the horrible elements of the past of Norway.
It's one of the most expensive local foods.
On the other hand, it's all expensive - a little glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds of sterling ($14).
Norway rarely appears in world news, and most people of the country seem to be suitable.
People are still unwilling to mention the name of Anders Bravic, racist and the extremist of the right push, who had been shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mention of his name, the terrorist is called "the case of 22 July".
Norwegians are very difficult to believe that in their peaceful country, one of their companions has been capable of such cruelty and murders.
The growth of Norway (from the early 1970s) is based on today's welfare of one of the largest oil sectors in the world.
"And oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, who delivers candidates with long-free rafis, a woman with long light hair and impressive blue eyes, the incorporation of Nordish welfare.
We are a people, as you call it, reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks great English.
We don't like showing up, we're not bragging.
Norway has very carefully addressed its oil, most of the revenues of the oil industry are invested in a special fund established for the benefit of future generations.
In the years preceding the global financial crisis, when all of them were incurred with the money they had not had, Norway carefully estimated all costs.
"As long as you can ride on winter skies and walk in summer, that's enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there's a rafix," she adds with a careless laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in a queue for some food, I'm done with a rafish.
There's a hamburger with flour meat -- it's definitely an exotic, delicious juice meat.
But tonight, there is even more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel, there is a special dinner dedicated to the rafisque, during which visitors define the best or perhaps the most flavourable fish.
There is a direct television showing the leading in the rabphis carpet surrounded by a raffic plate.
It looks like a song contest "European."
"Well, Thor-Yurgen, what is your estimate for the best fish in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our assessment."
Everyone laughs and applauses.
Someone's falling from the chair, maybe over the aquavity.
Or maybe just breathing in the smell of that fish.
The President of Mexico, Enrique Penya Neito, is about to start a difficult start of his career.
While the newly elected President of Mexico Enrique Penya Neeto is preparing to enter his position, the correspondent of BBC Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he has to face and the mixed expectations of his country.
The road movement in Mexico is now in a particularly pathetic state.
The city was also overloaded in the best time, and the steel fences had been raised since Monday, which crossed several key roads to the capital and caused chaos on roads.
However, it was done not to allow people to reach their work from suburbs, but to prevent the protest participants from entering the parliament.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Penya Neito, will put on the presidential bonds and accept the country's ruling.
It is a challenge.
Mexico has achieved good economic indicators in the administration of Felipe Calderon, which is now composing its powers, but the country has inflammated the drug war, which has already taken about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My Government claims to the people of Mexico that they are willing to fight violence," Mr. Penya Neito reported earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barak Obama, in the White House's oval office.
I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
In addition to such statements, the political career of Mr. Penya Neito was developed as Governor of his native state, Mexico.
In his family, in a dense and wide state, around the capital of the country, the views of the new leader were divided.
Relative Man
In the idilical town of Valje de Bravo, for example, it is mentioned warmly.
Inhabitants deserve him to rebuild tourism, the development of the court sphere and the establishment of infrastructure.
One of the new roads built by Mr. Penya Neito, which differ from the roads with the bouncing and the james that were earlier in this place, could be reached to the city.
Tables with his name are hanged on the modern sports center building and on an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We are linking hopes to real and serious changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, congressman from the Penya Neto institutional-revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to the current and decisive changes that our country so much needs, especially in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous residence, the Party of the PRI was exhausted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera acknowledged that, after his 12-year absence in the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, the Party has given great hopes on Enrique Penya Neito.
Furthermore, he rejected the accusations of uncontainableness that the new president had opposed.
He is very straightforward and very loyal to his vision of the future country.
He is an excellent public actor, and, first of all, a man who can listen.
But in another part of the state, many people had a different idea of the former governor.
The Nesaualcoitl Municipality, also known as Sudad Nes, is the most distinct contrast with the powerful streets of Valje de Bravo.
He is in many ways the suburb of Mexico.
The problems in the municipality also have a severe nature of this megapolis.
Earlier this year, troops were attracted to reduce drug trafficking gangs in these areas, and violence against women was particularly acute.
A few dozen bodies of killed women have been discovered in the wilderness near the extensive garbage in the past two years.
More than a thousand women were killed in Mexico during the governorship of Mr. Penya Neito -- it is significantly higher than that in the sadly famous city of Sudad-Huarez, whose name was condemned when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to the opponents of Mr. Penya Neito, it was best to say that he had failed to deal with the murder of women during his position as governor.
In the worst case, his administration was accused of the full ignorance of the problem.
A concrete house resident, similar to most houses in this hungry area, Irenea Buendia barely holds tears, showing me pictures of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
Mariana committed suicide in 2010 officially.
However, her family believes that her companion killed her.
"When I got to her house, it seemed like her body was washed before it," recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body was already around.
Mariana’s mother tells this story, and her daughter's portrait is looking at us from the wall where he hangs next to the sand, which is just one word: justice.
That is what they said that the family was rejected.
"The officials of the state treated me as an old speaker, dissatisfying a peacekeeper.
They want people to accept everything they say and keep silent.
But it is wrong, so it can't, especially when there are so many violations and misunderstandings around," she said.
By wearing the presidential bond on Saturday, President Penya Neito will take with it difficult responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have affected violence crimes, and the new president promised to make the problem a priority during his rule.
"I hope that he will be exactly the same president as the governor," said Olvera, a congressman from the Pri Party of Valje de Bravo.
However, this is the most fearful of the families of victims in Sudad Ness.
Bradley Manning has not complained of a bad treatment, he claims.
Prosecutors are trying to deny Bradley Manning's statements of bad detention conditions.
During the hearing, Manning stayed in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence requires the closure of the case on the grounds that the conditions of the opinion of Manning were cruel.
The United States Army has been accused of the abduction of several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the accusation tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who was accused of the largest secret material in the United States history, had not benefited from many possibilities to file a complaint against a bad treatment that he said had to transfer when he was in military prison.
During a cross-examination in pre-judicial hearing in Fort Mide, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Fayne stated that the records of weekly visits by the representatives of the prison administration in nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain a complaint about the wrong treatment.
A cross-examination in the review of the application for the protection of the Manning case on the basis of its cruel conditions and on its own punishment was conducted the next day after Manning stated that when he was in custody, he intended to commit suicide.
Military Intelligence Analysis Specialist, arrested in June 2010, is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents during the service in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the WikiLeaks website.
The WikiLeaks resource did not confirm that the source of information was Manning.
During the hearing on Friday, the Prosecutor Fein, along with Manning, reviewed the reports that were completed after the visits of Manning by the representatives of the administration during his residence in Quantico, where he was under the strict imprisonment regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein's prosecutor asked about the reports on Friday, Manning recognized that he appreciated the treatment of himself by the prison administration as “excellent” and the general conditions of the conclusion as “very professionally organized”.
The reports under consideration did not contain complaints of mistreatment, despite the questioning of the conditions of its content, Fayne said.
Manning replied that he expressed his oral concern about these problems and that his representatives of the administration had discussed these problems with him and claimed that they would deal with them but did not fix it in writing.
"They recorded "no problems" (after the discussion of my complaints), but that does not mean that I had not raised this subject in a conversation," said Manning.
The Military Judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about the unlawful treatment of him in January 2011 during the meeting of the commission that considered the suicidal intentions he expressed in writing several months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting he wanted to get out of the regime of “trauma warning” and mitigate the conditions of imprisonment.
The military leaders explained that the limited imprisonment regime was lower than the supervision regime to prevent suicide was introduced for the protection of the prisoner and for the security of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I'm okay to cancel the regime to prevent trauma... to improve my life level, from my view," explained Manning.
On Thursday, Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held nearly two months before he was transferred to a military base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that his thoughts of suicide appeared in Kuwait, and that he once lost consciousness because of a strong heat.
He explained that it was psychologically very difficult when you were not let to know how your participation is decided, and what is going on in the outside world.
"My world was condemned to the Camp-Arifjan base, to the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I'd die in this cell."
In Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell at least 21 hours and often even more than 23 hours daily, in full loneliness.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, blanket, blankets, a few clothes and glasses.
He said that he was trying to move, as sleeping or even just laying down in the day was prohibited.
According to Manning, when he was sleeping, he was constantly struggling the light of the camera outside.
If the guards did not see his face as he turned in bed at night, he said he was awakened and forced to turn on his back.
Manning's attorney formally objected to the unlawful treatment of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to military prison in Fort Levenworth, Kansas.
Furthermore, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he made during his testimony on Thursday that, after he was forced to sleep ongo in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked before the guards and other prisoners at the morning verification.
Manning stated that he had no possibility to cover his blanket during the verification.
In response to the questions of the judge on Friday, Manning said that he understood from the guard's order that he should drop the blanket that he could cover, but confessed that no one directly ordered him to leave it.
On Thursday, Manning stated that he had been forced to sleep naked last night because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not at risk to himself.
Manning said that he told the officer that he could use a tire of cowards or scums to hurt himself, but didn't.
That night, according to Manning's testimony, his underwear, the shrimp and the glasses were taken out of the cell.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he had to experience during his imprisonment and would substantially reduce the term of imprisonment, if Manning was found guilty by the war court that had to begin its consideration at the beginning of the next year.
The defence stated that it planned to invite Manning to admit guilt for less serious crimes, and other accusations to dispute as excessive.
The hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and the accusation party is expected to insist that the conditions of detention were justified.
Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the content of the arrested with the maximum strict regime.
Among the accusations raised to Manning are the assistance of the opponent, illegal promotion of data on the Internet, the transfer of information concerning national defence and the abduction of public property or documents.
If it is convicted on all the items of the prosecution act, it may be threatened by life.
My national self-determination crisis is the story of the American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the absence of the possibility to realize themselves.
Mexicans are inclined to blame those who have left because they remind the people of complex times.
Ruben Navarrette believes that the Mexicans of American origin are breaking apart between the two cultures.
During the recent trip to Mexico, I walked through the hallway for arrivals, approached border control zone and stuck.
The characters indicated two rows: one for Mexicanos (Mexican), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I was standing in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I was called Mexican all my life.
It's just a parole name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York consider themselves Italians.
Later, I stopped at the complicated construction of the American of Mexican origin.
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's family, there were no need for conditional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is more poor than the language hosts, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport, and I was turning to Extranjeros.
I remembered this story several days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico Enrique Penya Neito visited the White House and met President Obama.
The agenda had been used for the meetings of the Presidents of those countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Penya Neito was willing to talk about the rising of the Mexican economy, which made the Mexicans now, with the same success, to stay in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wished to conclude a treaty on partnership with the United States and Canada and to establish a North American Trade Block like the European Union.
Furthermore, President Penya Neito promised to continue the war against drug carters in Mexico, but no specific proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and executive issue of old insults.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848 the United States had invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half their territory.
But the Mexicans have been thinking for centuries, not for minutes, and they can see the reminders of those events in all.
It is therefore worth only a State deputy to speak to Mexico's criticism, press and mexican society's elite to complain that the Americans are affecting the sovereignty of the neighbors.
And the descendants of Montesum are filled with military.
The most complicated relations of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin in the United States are.
You want to talk about insults?
That's enough.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people who find opportunities for themselves in this country, and those who do not have such opportunities.
In L.A., Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Anthonyo, so many people of Mexican origin only for one reason: in some moment of their family history, someone, father or grandfather, had no opportunity to realize themselves in Mexico and had to go north.
These were mostly the Mexicans of a certain type -- misty, little-educated, poor farm families.
We are their descendants, and we remember it.
In Mexico, they see it differently.
Today, our life is an American dream, we have been studying in good schools, and we have done good jobs, but we don't forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and uncertain, but we know what country to consider.
United States of America.
Furthermore, we know that most representatives of the Mexican elita and the governing class do not love us.
We answer them the same.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating damages, and they refer to us as men of the second sort, as untrue Mexicans.
We don't speak well enough in Spanish, and our connections with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our existence is caused by failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We wouldn't be behind the silk curtain right now by finding a life in the United States, but by losing spiritual connections.
My wife was born in Guadalahar and legally moved to the United States as a child, and it reminds me that there are some tricks between the Mexicans and the Americans of Mexican origin, and the Mexican people understand their national identity more clearly, and the Americans of Mexican origin are offensive.
She is a US citizenship and believes that she belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of my famous Americans of Mexican origin do not feel belonging to any of them.
We're listening to the Mexican group of Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springstein.
When you get the best of two worlds, you're inevitablely losing roots.
We're Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we are called Mexicans.
Now, as I learned during my journey, as if our relationship was not enough confused, some Mexican leaders and intelligence representatives wish to restore their relationship with the diaspora.
They want the Americans of Mexican origin to work as Ambassadors of Mexico and represent its interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends about how beautiful this country is and how good to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen links with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It won't work.
Too many insults in the past.
In view of the diversion between rich and poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not think that this country is so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but you can handle it yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If a number of Mexicans still can't forgive the United States as they did with Mexico a century ago, they will also have to accept that some Americans of Mexican origin are still in an insult for the way they treated their relatives recently in Mexico.
Yeah.
I guess we've had more common than I thought.
Old Fights in the Near East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas grouping could be a fragile foundation for further peace
Is long - term peace possible between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed is the result of the degradation of such hopes.
Sounds as common, meaningless disputes on who started first; many buildings have been converted into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians were killed, most of whom were civilians and six Israelis; for the first time during the conflict released from the Gaza Strip missiles fell in the area of the capital of Israel Tel Aviv and the sacred city of Jerusalem.
However, even though the Israelis and the Palestinians were unbelievably involved in their everlasting conflict, there were changes in the Middle East.
This could be dealt differently, but the events of the Arab Spring have ended up in a rebel storm of rebellious realities, and the Palestinians with the Israelites were unable to stay away from the whirlwind of the region.
As a result, their fight will become even more bloodshed than before.
However, there are reasons for hope to get out of this deadly crap.
War without winners
At first, the situation does not give causes for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, the agreement signed on 21 November, will be fulfilled, the struggles that occurred this week only strengthened the positions of forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamic Movement of Hamas, who came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, would say that they had forced Israel to withdraw despite their losses.
Although some leaders of the group were destroyed and 1.7 million inhabitants were blocked in one of the most dense and troubled corners of our planet, Israel was unable to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas increases its popularity in the West Bank of Jordan, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by Fatch's more moderate movement.
Furthermore, the leaders of Hamas can conclude that time is working for them.
As the impact of Islamic movements in the Arab world increases, Hamas has new influenced and rich friends.
The returning regional leader of Turkey, who was once the nearest ally of Israel among the Muslim countries, spoke with the support of Hamas, followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic developing States of the Persian Gulf.
Hamas, associate parties, declared the establishment of the Islamic half-month around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, in which the armed group of Hezbolle, to Syria, where more and more Islamic rebels have been dismissed by the authority of Bashar Assada, and further to Jordan, where the king's authorities are threatening Hamas' allies.
The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region has occurred in the south borders of Israel, in the most dense and important Arab country, in Egypt, where President Muhammad Mursey has strengthened the impact of the movement of the brothers Muslimans.
Hosney Mubarak, who had been ruled by Egypt for 30 years and was dismissed in 2011, was a world dictator who had no special attention to the support of Hamas.
On the contrary, Muslim brothers are an organization, much similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more inclined to populism.
In the future diplomatic arrangements, Hamas could be an important player whose voice will not be able to silence even Israel and America.
At the same time, Israel's " severe " line " will come to the opposite conclusions.
In a military sense, Hamas was destroyed.
The Israeli Iron Dome Anti-Rake System justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the Hamas missiles launched.
Citizens of Israel can sleep peacefully, at least for a while.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to their permanent position; many European countries have also blamed the beginning of the last round of violence against Hamas.
Another important factor is Israel's economic prosperity, especially in the Government of Binjamin Netanjahu, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the death of approximately 30 Israeli missiles released from the Gaza Strip since 2004, Israel has been able to minimize the problem of mortal terrorists, partly through a wall that enters the West Bank of Jordan, a significant part of the unrecognised Palestinian State, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illicitity of such acts in the light of international legislation.
The position of Prime Minister Netanjahu, whose Party of Licud, in preparation for the elections at 22 January, was combined with even more aggressive conservators under the leadership of Avigdor Liberman.
What is the point of making the Palestinians and giving them their own State?
If all the powers in the West Coast are handed into their hands, will they not start launching missiles from there to Israel, as their meetings in the Gaza Strip?
Better to keep them behind the wall and to suppress any attempt to raise their heads.
Possibly the "growth" lines will win; however, their calculations may be rejected by the Arab spring.
While Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries have not the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defence part of Israel's budget is more than all Arab neighbours collected together.
Resolution of war with the regional supernational is hardly helping the Arab Governments to strengthen their own economy.
The pragmaticism of the President of Egypt, Murcy, who worked with Barak Obama on the ceasefire, was a good sign and could mark the beginning of change.
Israel should, at least, take into account the long-term consequences of its policy.
As a result of democratic changes in Arab countries, the deprivation of Palestinians of the right to self-determination constitutes a slow bomb that will explode in Israeli occupied territories, like a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repressions already undermine the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic aspect of the growth of the Arab population is only aggravating these problems.
For bloodshed operations conducted every few years in the Gaza Strip to overcome the Hamas movement, the increasing dissatisfaction of the international community must be paid.
Both parties need external impulse
There remains the only solution to which healthy representatives on both sides call on, as well as the majority of the rest of the world, and our newspapers: the education of two States and the Israeli derogation of the territories in exchange for security.
The hope remains, not too exciting in a short-term perspective, that the hope that ceasefire will allow other countries to influence more effectively on the sides of the conflict.
Egypt, who had long time to decide to close arms to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar have as ever been able to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and joint use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fatch movements.
This would do more to create a Palestinian State than the forthcoming UN vote, which could result in the recognition of Palestine ' s virtual state.
The President of Obama should also play its role in putting Israel in the negotiation table.
During his first time, he has never introduced his own peaceful settlement plan.
Once he returned to the White House, he remained unwilling to join the problem.
It's a catastrophic little position.
The United States is vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the law on a single packaging for cigarettes entered into force.
The warnings of smoking and images affected by parts of the body are contrastful to the uneven green boxes similar to all cigarette marks.
The first Australian law on the one-type packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products entered into force, replaceing logos and colored shapes of different marks of the same olive painting with horrible pictures affected by parts of the body and pictures of children whose health was blown by smoking their parents.
In addition to various pictures and labels warning of smoking harm, the only difference between packages as required with this Saturday is the names of the marks that are printed by the same small font.
These are the most rigid conditions in the world to make packagings of tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the aim of this measure is to prevent young people from smoking, depriving this harmful fashion status habit.
Based on this decision, studies showed that people who were not smoking up to 26 are never smokers in 99 cases of 100.
"Seems that even at the youngest ages children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to bring through packaging," explains the Minister for Health, Tanya Plibersek, referring to research that, for example, the crown in the logo, has been associated with children with the idea of the princess.
Australia is one of the least smoker countries in the world, so that these changes will not affect the profits of transnational corporations, but the possibility of taking such measures is already considered by other countries.
The representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market with cheap and accessible cigarettes.
"This law will lead to serious consequences of those who have been contemplated by his initiators," believes Scott McIntajer, representative of the British American Tobacco company in Australia.
Fake-producers from China and Indonesia will place much more such goods for sale in Australia's streets.
For someone, on the contrary, new laws contribute to the growth of business.
Sandra Ha, from a small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that the demand for portrigers and silicon furnaces hiding unpleasant paintings on the package has rapidly grown (practically from zero) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco were trying to claim the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already implemented a number of six thousand goods to the company and expects a new party.
It's a good business for us.
The potential disturbance for the effectiveness of such measures is, in the opinion of experts, the popularity of social networks among the part of the population to which these measures are addressed.
Following the adoption of a number of laws in Australia that have made illegal television advertisements and support for sports activities, as well as prohibiting sellers to issue cigarettes in visible places, the tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Government of Australia prohibited local companies and websites to place advertising in the network, but it could not limit foreign sites.
"If you trade in tobacco products and you have only this small batch, the idea of promoting your goods on the Internet will seem very attractive to you," explains Becky Freeman, studying public health at the University of Sydney.
Freemen notes the increase in the number of trademark reviews written by allegedly common users in social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is, is this really the case of a soldier who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he has not regretted his strength and time and made a video, or is it the advertising company behind it?
The Australian British American Tobacco office claims that the industry is currently more engaged in adaptation to new rules than by advertising.
The representatives of the tobacco industry have even taken measures such as the sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to dispute new rules: these States make claims within the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been subjected to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that trade relations of all these countries with Australia are very minor.
WTO decision was expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Plibersek, the Government discussed with other countries the possibility of taking similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada introduced the first mandatory placement of photographs that warned of smoking harm.
This rule is now adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of reinforcing laws is considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are not demonstrated to innovation.
These pictures don't bother me.
I just don't pay attention.
"You just grab a cigarette and hide a pack in your pocket," explains Victor El Hayg, buying cigarettes with a photo of the mouth-based tumor.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me leave is my little daughter.
James Yu, head of the tobacco store King of the Pack in the centre of Sydney, claims that the same packaging has complicated the task of laying stocks
"Then I had an hour to unload the new party, and now four hours," he complained.
"The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, and then we would say what to do, okay, it's over, closing the store," he said, throwing his hands up.
Losting in the world of electronic networks and constant connections is not so bad.
On this Thanksgiving Day, I had to spend five hours at the airport, because our plane had mechanical disorders and was replaced by another plane we were waiting for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of boring.
I won't lie to you.
The afternoon at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and there will be no help from books, magazines, iPhone, nor even shops of non-profit trade.
However, recently, more scientists and child development experts have been exposed to bored.
They say that in certain situations, we and our children do not miss so badly.
This forces the brain to distract interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in the modern world, we are all constantly in front of a screen, the boring advantages are passing past us.
Maybe we need to try to get bored?
Yeah.
And not at the same time.
We'll get back to that.
I used to think, like many, that boredness was a recent invention when people had more free time.
This is not true, said Peter Tui, professor of the Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University of Calgari, author of the book “Atributing history of boring” (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom can be praised by a very ancient history," he said.
The walls in Pompees have found Latin signs of boring dated the first century.
The question of how we understand boring is still open.
The problem is, said John D. Istud, Adjunct Professor of York University in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boring has often changed.
By studying research on this subject and asking the target group of 100 people, Professor Iствуd and his colleagues came to the following definition: boring is when people want, but cannot do what would bring them satisfaction.
The difference between boring and apathy, he says, is that a missed person does not do anything that he would like to do.
There's nothing to do with apathy.
The main thing in the experiencing boredom, he said, is "a disturbance of attention and the connected deterioration of the mood and the feeling that the time is slow."
Boredness may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that, despite the possible connection between these situations, people who miss people see the causes of problems in the world and the circumstances, and people who suffer from depression see problems.
Sometimes we feel bored when we really have a hard time concentrating on something.
In his study “Untranemployed reasons: the definition of boring attention”, published in the September magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues refer to the previous experiment, whose participants listened to the voice record of the reader's journal.
Some participants also heard loud sounds of non-related television program in the neighbouring room, others heard the same sounds in low volume, so that the third group could hardly distinguish them, and only listened to a voice record without a foreign sound track.
Those participants who heard a low-level television pointed out that they were bored, most frequently, they were difficult to focus, but they did not know the reasons for that, and they were boring.
When we are trying to focus on the difficult or fascinating challenge, disturbance may be boring, said Mark J. Fenske, adjunct professor of neurology at the University of Gwelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "for example, seeing the flow of products on the conveyer in search of marriage, a distractioning music can help to avoid boring."
It is estimated to continue that when people start to humble on a chair or draw drawing cartoons on the list of paper, they do it from boringness, but now we know that such actions are actually helping not to relax physically.
"The study showed that children who are not prohibited from turmoiling and rotating are learning better and remembering more information than children who are required to sit calmly," said Professor Fenske.
At some point, we all are bored to hear a monotonous speech by watching an uninteresting film when flight is delayed (as in my case).
However, different people show a different degree of boringness.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special “scope of boringness” to measure such individual characteristics.
In order to determine this scale, questions and allegations are used, for example, "Mnoge of the things I have to do, uniformly and monotonically" or "I am too interested in, so I don't have enough time for anything."
Through these questionnaires, researchers have identified that boys miss more girls,” said Stephen Vodanovic, a psychologist at the University of Western Florida, especially with various external irritators.
However, adolescents generally often miss.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of personal and public development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he had been contacted with a pager nearly with 400 teenagers and their parents 7 to 8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32 per cent of adolescents claimed that they were bored at school and during their homework, and 23 per cent claimed that they were bored outside the school.
Only 3% of their parents noted that they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no information about the kind of boring data that would be like this, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “in adolescent ages, ” mostly because children and adolescents are not allowed to decide fully what to do.
Let's go back to my original question: is boring helpful?
Sometimes it does not, because, in extreme manifestations, it shows that it can push people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risk gambling or abuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers were wondering about the relationship between boring and creative, said Professor Vodanovic, who devoted more than two decades to study the problem.
"So our brain tells us that we should do something else; that is boring," said Gary Marcus, a psychologist professor at the New York University.
However, this brain does not always know what to do.
If you're bored and you'll send this energy to a guitar game or cooking experience, you'll make it better.
But if you watch the TV, you'll only feel better for a while, and it'll pass soon.
Therefore, if your child misss and you give him iPad, he will stop missing, but he will not learn to fight boring alone or any other way to manage his time and employment," says Professor Fenske.
"And such self-regulation skills are in various situations," he said.
Your child learns not only to do something alone, but also to learn self-control at all.
I don't think it's boring.
However, it is not worth considering it bad.
We should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous stream of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees with that.
"We see this so that we need to get more bored, while boring is an extremely unpleasant, inconvenient desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people strive to get away from constant concerns and simply relax.
"In the modern world, we are used to constantly excessively stimulating the organs of feelings," he says, "and when silence comes, we lose and we don't know what to do."
Unfortunately, the new marihuana legalization law in Colorado
Anthony Orosco, nineteen-year-old football team player and a public college student in the south-east of Colorado, accused of committing a criminal crime that would soon be completely legal in the entire state: a small portion of marihuana and the tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosco said that he was with his friends in Lamar in September and drove in a prerium car near the border with Kansas, when the police were stopped.
After the police found in the car of marijuana, Mr. Orosco had come to the court for drug storage and possession of drug-use devices, minor offences, each of which was deemed to be fined by $100 and appointed the date of the judicial meeting.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of uncertainty, which has been on several weeks since the state of Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the solution of hundreds of small judicial cases depends not on the law as much as on the place of consideration.
Prosecutions for small offences related to marijuana have already been removed in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, which took a similar measure.
The police stations have already ceased to accuse people aged 21 and older than holding small doses, which would be considered legitimate as soon as the law enters into force in a few weeks.
However, in the more conservative districts of Colorado, prosecutors decided to consider existing marijuana cases and continue to be responsible for the preservation of the drug.
At the same time, in some towns from Denver’s suburbs to the mountains of the West, they vote to prevent the appearance of new marijuana shops licensed by the state.
"It all develops so rapidly that I don't even know what to wait next," said Daniel J. Outs, head of the police in Aurora city east of Denver.
Representatives of control bodies in the State of Washington also distractedly honour the heads.
They have to establish rules to determine the order of licensing, processing, dissemination and sale of marijuana, and all of this must be done until 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, is in front of most other states in dealing with marijuana, first for medical purposes and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado, a more arranged market, so they will serve a good example," explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the Council for Manufacturing and Consuming Alcohol Products in Washington.
But now no one can do more, admits Mr. Smith than to make any suggestions and hope that it will work.
"We don't have a real precedent that we can orient," he said.
The Washington Law, called I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will put the State into uncertainty for a year when the State License System is not yet available and the law of marijuana has already been legitimate.
There are also difficult technical aspects that need to be resolved during this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state ' adequate access' of the licensed marijuana with a prohibition of its trade at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and gardens.
"It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana trade companies in cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs," explained Ben Livingston, a representative of the recently established Research Group "Center of Marijuana Legalization".
On 21 November, the Chief of the Outs police from Aurora sent to his e-mail officers that the prosecutor of the city would no longer attract persons aged 21 to the responsibility for the possession of a small quantity of marihuana and that the police would cease to distinguish people in the data violations " starting from now."
The Chief of Police Outs reported that the police would monitor compliance in the city with the rules governing the activities of persons growing marijuana for medical purposes and will persecute illegal drug dealers and distributors.
The prosecutor of the West District in the northern Colorado, Ken Buck, has a more strict approach to this issue.
After the draft vote, he stated that the prosecutor would continue to be responsible for the possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage the users to take the course of treatment.
At this point, 119 persons have been accused of preserving two and less uncies of marijuana, although many of them are accused of other violations.
"The obligation of our institution is to persecute for acts that are considered criminal when they were committed," said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The response was unequivocable even in areas such as the Mesa rural district where voters rejected the proposal for marijuana legalization.
The Grand Jankshn Police, the largest city in the district, is no longer responsible for possessing small drugs.
The District Prosecutor, Pete Hautcinger, supported the decision, but also decided not to withdraw charges on already open cases related to marijuana storage.
"I believe that to ensure compliance with the law until it change is our direct responsibility," he said.
Although 55 per cent of the people in the state of Colorado who participated in the voting supported this decision, the inclusion of marijuana for entertainment in the public and legal system would not be easy.
The contrary to the residential response in different places of the state has revealed the misunderstanding of the relationship of local authorities with the marihuana experiment.
" The district prosecutors have a cultural barrier in this matter," explains Sean Macalister, a denver lawyer who represents the interests of convicted for the storage of marijuana, and the local representative of the National Law Reforming Organization.
"They have been persecuting people for this so long that they can't truly accept that this is no longer a crime," he said.
Colorado and Washington are the first states in which marihuanas are related to a small number as alcohol is meant to become an experimental field in the scale of the country to verify the idea of drug legalization itself.
Legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory of legitimate trade, however, they look forward to instructions from federal authorities that continue to consider sale and growing marijuana as federal crimes.
Participants of marijuana legalization hope that the Office of Justice will withdraw in this regard.
Despite a number of resonances in the arrests of traders and patients using marijuana on medical testimony, the Federal Government has in most cases benefited from marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
The Narcotics Bureau would hardly break into homes to confiscate a small package of marihuana, but they would barely close their eyes to the state-regulated marijuana recreation shops authorized under the new law, believes Kevin A. Sabeth, former drug advisor in Obama's administration.
Some cities in Colorado have failed to wait for the actions of federal authorities.
Before presidential elections, some local administrations approved the moratorium to open new marijuana sales shops, which would not be able to open before a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, issued a six-month ban on marihuana trade, which would appear to be approved next week.
"We do not want to be in such a situation that we will issue a license to someone and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There remains a lot more unsolved issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I was survived from Oxford for being a conservator.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As far as I remember, I always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and my older brother studied in Oxford and described it as the best educational establishment in the world, a modern symposium similar to the ancient symposium, which sets up two foundations of civilization -- freedom and tolerance.
However, two weeks later, I collected baggages and left, which was the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand and cry.
Friends were distracted.
The Evening Standard claimed that I quit college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
A. Normann Wilson was kidding me that I left because I had to drink from scarlet cups.
It wasn't really so funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, she ran away because I was systematically poisoned and frightened.
Not because of my very unusual name or the fact that I was in private school.
I was poisoned for only one reason, and in this famous enlightenment colleague, it seemed to be a real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now dead Woodrugh Wyatt, was a famous advisor, Margaret Tatcher, and I was a conservator.
You'll ask why to mention it now?
According to the latest data, the new generation of students who follow the right center views is subjected to the same traw.
This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred to Conservator students in Oxford is so strong that last week the group of such students required the same protection as the one provided to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
The Conservatories from the College College Corps of Christi in Cambridge claim that they are "violently isolated, personally attacked and forced to feel unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They wished to introduce an additional representative to the Committee on Equal Rights of the College in order to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only accelerated by the recent BBC 2 documentary film on the politics in the student ' s miracles Page: Young, Smart and Right ' s, in which the conservators were presented with excentrics and non-nazis.
The film showed Joe Cook, former president of the Oxford University Conservator Association, who is driving in Rolls Royce, wears a silver suit and a silver coat.
In other universities, Conservatory students complain that they are making "cozles for the increase of the wages for education."
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice-President of the Nottingham University Conservatory Association, in an interview with one of the Sunday newspapers, said that “the university environment has increased the distraction of the left views.
Those who don't even know us are considered to be narrow and undeniably cruel children of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21, student of the College of History, Corps Christ, in which a request was made to strengthen protection, calls such an atmosphere " uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cheryl, 19, a new president of the University of Conservators of Oxford, said that the attitude of members of the Student Club to the holders of the right-centrist views was significantly deteriorated.
"It is a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply for the normal life of members of the club," she said.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I wasn't just a minority, I was alone.
I got there in September 1986, a shy and shy eighteen - year - old girl.
Oxford had a fever from hatred to a conservative party.
A year before that, the university had deprived her former student Margaret Tatcher from reducing budgetary appropriations for higher education.
In such a atmosphere, even stabilizers would be uncomfortable.
In the first days of the first week, when students met each other and the teachers, I first felt what was waiting for me.
I didn't know that teachers were not only looking through their fingers on the traw of conservator students, but they were also happy to participate in it.
Political issues -- strike of miners, privatization and disagreement by the Government to apply sanctions against the Government of apartheid to South Africa -- have been invaded through wooden panels of the audience wall.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century to English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Ms. Wyatt," said the teacher, now the dead Harry Pete, please translate the first paragraph."
The text was hard for me, and I stopped.
Harry Pete was a very greedy man with a face like a cake.
"The tatcherists don't basically learn French or they just lack brains?" he asked.
Other students were screwed up.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I advise you to take a few early French lessons in the free time, if you are not very busy turning into society," said Pitt.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night in college, I was sitting alone at lunch, and then someone caught me on my shoulder.
It was James, a second class student from the English College, who was represented as a member of the University Conservator Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
- Unfortunately, the case is as follows:
Everyone suspected of sympathy to conservators will be kidding.
It's hard for me, and in your case, they know your father's close to Margaret Tatcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most conservators pretend to be leaborists."
Later, in the local pub, I was cowardly trying to hypocrisy.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Tatcher said.
Smartness has failed.
The first year of the philosophy, politics and economies, who was studying in Ethan, said: "You are the daughter of the fascist pig.
You're infected."
Other students took up his words.
I was ruined, dirty.
"How are the conservators having sex?" One of them asked.
- They're hitting each other, aren't they?"
I felt like homosexuals must have felt before the offence of criminal persecution in the 1960s.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet with one-minded men only under the shelter of the night?
Will I be forced to be a laborist and to hide my true beliefs?
For me three years, it seemed like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only because he belonged to the conservators but also because he was Tatcher's foreign policy advisor and one of its spiciates.
He almost didn't show up in college.
He despised him for the provinciality, tinyness and commitment to the marxist determinist view of history.
In 1997, he took a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not gonna be happy here," he told me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents’ home in London, trying to find asylum among my relatives and unprecedented capital friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his forty years of training, there were any political views.
"But this is the best university in the world," he regretted.
- They're not capable of this, but not in the city of the drowning pillars...
Even my communist friends always acted perfectly."
His wet eyes were embarrassed.
"Don't make any rushful decisions.
I'm sure it's just jokes.
You'll break my heart if you leave the university."
I was exhausted by the constant journeys to London, and my emotional protection was weakening.
My friend, also a conservator, did not endure pressure and refused his beliefs.
The next week, during the seminar, when another history teacher seriously called me "the enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
In the shower burning out of shame, I confessed that my parents washed my brains, and I called them "old fools".
The rest was short.
The last iron in my cave of career in Oxford was meant to slap my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns every week for publications belonging to Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I didn't leave, and five minutes later my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I picked up a suitcase and sat on the first train to London.
I haven't come back before.
You can call me a pussy and a scumbag.
But at the age of eighteen, no one should become a subject of such anger and intimidation in the school.
More sadly, it was Oxford, who not only released the fourteen Prime Ministers of Tours but is hiding for the unemployed reputation of the university in which equality and freedom of thinking are appreciated.
Valentino prefers the elegance of glory.
The exhibition of Valentino: Sewing Master, which opened this week in London, ABC interviews with Natti Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica and other known Italian designer clients
Somerset House, former residence of England Queen Elizabeth I, the only place in the British capital is to take an exhibition on Valentino Garawani.
Designer recognized this during the opening of Valentino: Sewing Master, a triumphable retrospective exhibition, which combines more than 130 high-fashion dresses created by his home for the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the history, the only character of which is Garawani's "or "señor", but it could not be written without his own customers.
Valentino always felt fascinated by a rare and far-related world to know.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March, there are many personal letters and photos for the signing of the most significant aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga-Han to Lord Snowdon, including Mari-Shantal, the princess of Greece, and Margaret, the Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as the trophies of his social rising: from a modest porter from the city of Voger in northern Italy to an international elite.
Being in love with the royal court is nothing wrong.
"They at least don't put out their cigarettes on your wonderful carpet, as some beautiful pop music stars do," says Barones Fiona Tissen-Bornemica.
In the 1960s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an unlike master and accepts guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all liked to arriving in his shale in Gstaad," explains the former wife "Hainey" Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beauty like Marella Anielli or Eugene Niarchos.
Valentino always preferred the elegance of glory.
And despite that, he is a star.
Valeria Maza representing Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Maz remembers a charismatic modeler.
Once we went to dinner at his house, it was after showing fashion in the Spanish Square in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, younger.
Valentino's style was shown in everything -- in every detail of his apartment, in her clothes, in food, in music.
"Each of the Valentino guests felt important and loved," recalls the top model, which started with the modeler in 1995 during the High Mode Week in Paris.
"He never gets out of fashion, because his escorts are real works of art," she ends.
Natural Paragraph
The life of Garawani is a history of obsession, but of in love with full mutuality.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries has been converted into a glomur floor of sixty-four meters long, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of models and has to defilize on the floor, the "sighters" from the heels that shine from Valentino, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy had chosen for her wedding with Aristotel Onassass, the suit that Monica Whitti used in "Noc" or the coat of the hair and skin belonging to the empire of Fara Diba.
These models are called Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Taxis, Matte Marith from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Gabsburg.
Nati Abascal and modeler, 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "that's impossible to forget."
I remember him beautifully.
These were pants, shirts, jackets and winter winter collections, 1971-1972.
"This was the gift he made to me," said Natti Abascal, one of the designers' museums.
"I prefer it to the others for his feminineness, for his great love for women, because he underscores our beauty," added the former Duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors that he uses: they have a lot of light and they're "suitable" to his face.
Proportions are perfect.
The Princess and Patricia's lawmakers of the Fashion Della Jowampaola d'Arenberg can not forget the first time she dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have an age and a reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
The hour finally came at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to put it on a holiday in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a suit with scratches, a "course" in a store and a cut without a bracelet.
"It was a dream that became a phenomenon," said the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is overtime," explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her holiday dress from a modeler with "maximum caution... because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a combination of memories that accompany him."
The King of Fashion
The large final of the Summerset House, Marie-Shantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pauls from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (which he calls his shiew model) to make this sheet of elephant bone colour with pearl incrustation, twelve different types of circles and a pinch at four and a half meters.
According to a journalist, Susie Manquez, the highest authority of the specialized press, the dress is the weight of high fashion at the end of the 20th century, the "return of clients from the highest world".
The Valentino is now the best representative of the elite ' s lifestyle for many years.
The Cavaler of the Great Cross (the distinction of the highest rank in Italy), the Labour Cavaler, the Commander of the Order of Arts and Words rewarded by the Order of the Honorary Legion, Garawan gathered as much honour as any of his client's spouses.
"I have always drawn his attention to his delicateness, his calmness, his cautious and improper appearance," he recalls, "Arenberg.
Last time I saw him a month ago at a feast dinner at the Orse Museum.
He was sitting at the table with Count Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was inadequate, time doesn't exist for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: miners from Kawah-Ijan
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk life and health by dragging 70 pounds of cheese to the top of the volcano on the cool stone paths
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of 400 miners who earn grass in the Kawah Idjan volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Each day, Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where the sink gas rising from the depths of the Earth is stopping in contact with air.
The cuts of the huge pieces of cheese, the weight of which can reach 70 pounds, put them in two bamboo trash, drops the basket on his shoulders and brings them up on a broken rocky road.
To the top of the volcano, which is 2.386 metres high, only 250 meters, but the exhausted loaders are required for more than 40 minutes to rise in a turtle step, with difficulty maintaining balance and carefully pinching the road to avoid falling down and falling down.
They know that one incorrect step could cost them life, as it happened to a French tourist who broke down a few years ago from Kawah-Ijan rocks.
The Kavah-Ijan Shachters earn 5 euro cents for each kilogram of cheese they gain
When they arrived upstairs, they put their way between tourists who photograph them, as if they were monkeys from the circus and were tired of carrying heavy baskets, three miles to the weights that the mining company had located a little higher, at a height of 1,850 meters.
This is the PT of Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting since 1960 and, rather not to say, its employees to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilogram of serum.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) of oil production, as this mineral is widespread in daily life and is used to produce limbs, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to white sugar.
"We make about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each walk," Anto explains to us, which normally performs three daily transfers.
He spends three hours on each of them and eventually feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems miserable for such unhuman efforts, it is three times more than what he would earn in the field.
"The salary to miners is very high at local rates where the coffee is paid for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is equal to two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the truck who used to work as a stoneman on the Bali Tourist Island.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (EUR 6,2 per day) and the station was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banjuvangi, a town near the volcano, for a reason that in Indonesia was the same destructive as the cheese: "I married a girl with Bali, where some hindus, and brought her to Java to accept Islam."
Anto's astma, he's breathing hardly, he coughs all the time, and he's got eyes off because of toxic gases.
At his 27 years, Anto had spent three years risking himself in Kawah Ijan, whose cheese has already been affected despite the availability of masks and special scores.
He has astma, he breathes hardly, coughs constantly, and he's got eyes off because of the toxic gases that volcano is allocated.
This is the price he should pay for his dream.
"I will work for another two years because I want to open or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this pleasant and clever young man could be a tourist leader, a waiter or a portier in the hotel, but instead he is doing the mule work.
For the dirty wooden cabin with other bearers, it stands every day at 2:00 a.m. because the cheese continues to flow at night when its character yellow color turns into blue and shines in the middle of the dark.
By calling the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, enlightening his way with a small lamp connected to his helmet, which he bought for his money.
Approximately 400 cartlers gray baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company did not mechanism the extraction of cheese for cost savings and does not provide any equipment to the hosts who work on their own and with such deprivations.
In fact, they don't even receive parts of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of a photo-package collection, which, along with an entrance ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euro), the guardians take from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its men's mules.
"It's work for cattle and not for people," said Badrusin, a core carrier of 42 years, who spent three decades in Kawah-Ijan since he left college.
He can raise up to 110 pounds, and he assures that he will endure the work as much as he can, because he needs the money for the education of his three children aged 18 to 10 years.
I'm not retiring, I'm gonna die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the cheese burns his throat and burns his eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in the dense pillars of the smoke, they are so exhaustive that no one complains about their severe diseases... more serious than their usual breath problems, artross, knee pains and wounds on the shoulders that have been deformed under the weight of the trash.
By balancing the basket on the back, Unainik can now only raise 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
He and his companions each day carry 15 tonnes of cheese from the volcano, which are transported to the storage in Tamansari by crossing 18 miles from the narrow trail between the plants.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unaiik, opening his mouth widely, which lacks a few teeth.
Of his five children, older, 30 years old, he also works as a cheese carrier.
Time is passing, but poverty eternizes from generation to generation one of the most difficult practices in the world: what human mules of Kawah-Ijan are doing.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
The Singapore accuses the career, stress and prices of housing and education for the absence of children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm a patriot husband, you're my patriotic wife, we'll fulfill our civil debt and create life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising of meth but, despite this -- or perhaps because -- this video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
These phrases are part of the rap, which uses local sayings like "Let's put bao in the furnace" to laugh at the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency, which made this video, BBH, hoped that they would be able to draw attention to this issue in entertainment.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music so that people would fulfil their "national debt".
This is only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the main problem in the country.
We're the worst in the world in reproducing ourselves like this, so we felt that this is the subject that we should touch.
We knew that the Government was trying to do a lot of things, for example, to launch ghosts with feromones or organize a quick meeting party.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why don't we make the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely, a rap?
1.2 Child
Whoever does not take this so lightly, it is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 per year for policy to encourage citizens for the birth of more children.
The State Package for Marriages and Parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends pregnancy and birth leaves and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech state in South-East Asia, also known as conservative and strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population office, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2, which was known as a percentage of replacement in 1976.
So why don't Singapore have more children?
Tan Wei Min, director of the Political Office for Marriages and Familys of the National Population Management, said that the cause of "developed education" and "the wider gamma of career opportunities".
"It allows people to have a wider gamma of options in terms of life goals and priorities, except the wedding and the establishment of the family," she explains.
These changes in social norms contribute to the increase in the number of hospitals and the postponement of marriages and birth of children, resulting in a decrease in birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, immigration policy, which aims at a rapid increase in immigration for resistance to the reduction of populations, causes disturbance among the local population.
There are web sites in Singapore, where there is barely hidden xenophobia for many new immigrants, especially Chinese who are criticised for low-level salary and unwanted integration.
The growth of immigration is also considered one of the reasons why the ruling Singapur party had received the worst result from the elections since independence last year.
After the elections, it was an attempt to solve the problem, using quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While fertility declines have a significant impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax income, medical and immigration policy costs, the Singapore example also began to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government endeavours not to build so little housing.
For example, it began to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development leadership has been controlled by the number of small apartments known as “shoe boxes” that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments are very well sold on the area of 46 square meters.
Nevertheless, there is a view that they can contribute to a familiar lifestyle and deprive the stimulation of builders who want to build a large family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, Director-General of the EL Developing Home Company, said that their "shoe boxes" were sold much faster than spatial copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are redeployed for a few days, even weeks, faster than apartments larger.
As a result, our cash income is increasing.
Nevertheless, he recognizes that new standards provide clearer orientations for the constructors who had previously been put on the ground if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too tense
Singapore is a public city.
Although these new rules could be a step towards increasing national birthability, after talking to Singapores working in the financial quarter of the centre, they seem to have no special effect.
"People are very tense, expensive housing, as well as education, and so many people are delaying it," said the young manager.
Others can have children.
"But it is important for me to have my own money and time," said another young man for 20 years.
Men and women mention their career, stress and housing prices and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, whatever the Government has tried to incite its citizens to birth children, in regard to the childbirth, the last word remains behind the Singaporeans.

In four cases, they associated the term "me" with something very mine, personally, and "password and user name" when they applied it to social networks.
"My greatest secrets I would not have posted," says a decade-year-old Jorge when he was trying to explain the importance of personal on Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has records for two years.
"It's very secret secrets, my mom might know them, but not the whole world," he said.
On the FB, I load beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
I also have fun with my friends.
"I wouldn't share a photograph that wasn't mine or someone who acts stupid," he said.
The boy realizes that it is bad to publish inappropriate pictures of naked people, crimes or to write insulting or irritating comments.
Jorge assures that he knows 35 friends he's got in the FB and nine of his Twitter folks.
Most of them are relatives.
Mother knows she has a password for one of the accounts.
I've created Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just loading them," he added.
"Social networks are entertainment, I can talk to remote relatives or to my friends quickly," he said.
Without thinking, he answers that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't count with someone who recommended it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and at last admits that he doesn't know 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, music, for example," he said.
According to the boy, no one interfered with him and asked him for his home address or phone number.
"If I'm pressed or demanded, I'll just remove them from my account," he admits.
José became a follower of the Ask after reading the Twitter recommendation.
The boy doesn't know what's known as cybermobling today.
One of my friends was blackmailed in the social network.
He was threatened and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assured.
The victim, according to Jose, did not remove the account.
"Only included confidentiality."
He then explained the sequence of steps to set the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would have loaded pictures of the familiar in uncomfortable or confusive situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if I didn't like a person or if I wanted to.
"Which I know it's cybermobling," he confirms.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and trainer for education and education, believes that the purpose of informing children and adolescents is to understand that the objective of social networks is to be informed.
"The Internet appeared as a tool for searching for information, but with these sites, the game rules have changed," she noted.
Porras pointed out that academic Mark Prenski, a teacher of education from the Yale University and a writer of the Digital Aboriginals and immigrants, invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginals are those, children and youths who were born in the age of technology.
"We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are still learning," she said.
It explains that this theme is complicated, "because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be distributed, published, or said, when maturity is not enough for it."
"As for them to be electoral, while most importantly, to be popular to them, to have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences," she added.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show the confidentiality of children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
"Tell them not to do this, it is useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or would you like to have published a picture of you like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know that others will publish about you?
When you sign photos from the party, do you ask for permissions from other people to mark them?
And another thing, do everyone need to know what you're doing at any time?
Another item is to allow them to understand that they should be acting online as they do offline.
The same rules.
"About the Internet, a person acts with respect, responsibility and other principles, as should be in social networks," she said.
Carefulness
Estuardo Guardia, university teacher, primary education professor and education advisor, explains the need for family heads to read social network policies.
They have good reasons for talking to children about preventions for the opening of an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published," he said.
According to Guardia, the key question is to remind children of the lesson: "Don't talk to strangers."
UNASUR Summit ends without the announcement of the Lime Declaration
VI the Presidential summit of the South American Union (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the announcement of the Lima Declaration, announced earlier and theoretically signed by the family by binding participants.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI regular meeting of Heads of State and Governments of UNASUR, but the sources from the Office and the Administration of the President indicated on the main page that it would be transferred after closing, but then confirmed that at a certain point it would be published on the website of the Peruian Government.
On the text issues, they pointed out that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Oliant Umala, during brief press statements.
The access of journalists to information on the Summit was always limited.
During the day it was only transmitted in the press hall, a video of the presidential Assembly without sound with the message "closed meeting, sound prohibited".
A few information circulated among the reporters was transmitted by the press secretaries of some UNASUR Governments attending the meeting, but not peruanian.
The only document circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused the dissatisfaction of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media that requested more information.
The Administration of President Peru subsequently sent an electronic message to the media with the " final declaration " of the summit, but it was a statement from Umala, not an official document concluded by the summit.
Last October, the Summit of South American and Arab countries (ASPA) adopted III and, despite the insistence of the press, the so-called Lim Declaration had not been distributed before.
The official ASPA website can be verified that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruan authorities have made sure that the transmission systems are provided for all journalists, but have limited the receipt of information.
The summit was also concluded by the joint decision of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court, which addressed the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Oliant Umala and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, gathered at the regional meeting and ratified that they would follow the International Court's decision, which begins on Monday in the Hague to hear the statements of both parties, in the context of the charge that Lima has filed against Santiago.
"We will respect and implement a decision that will clarify the differences we are presenting to this international court," said Umala, next to our Chilean colleague.
" Chile was, it was and would be a country respecting international law, peaceful resolution of disagreements, covenants and international tribunals," Pinier added, and welcomed the repression of Umalo's hand on the basis of the flags of these two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they were subjected to the International Court of Justice took place immediately after Colombia protested the Bogotic Covenant this week, in which she recognized that the verdict of this international court after the decision on the marine borders from Nicaragua, which it felt was wrong.
The summit took place in the absence of Brazilian presidents, Dillma Rushef; Venezuela, Ugo Chaves; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christine Kirshner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011 after the impeachment of his former President Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
The Chairman, Oliant Umala, was responsible for the opening of the discussions in the morning and the closure of the summit, a little later afternoon after the Lima Time.
The head of the State read the outcome document in which he stated that 16 agreements had been adopted and had been approved for action on 31 project among South American countries, and the estimated investment amounted to $17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries would take " important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship for which we extend the residence agreements".
He reported that action was being taken to improve “collaboration in combating citizens ' insufficientness and against organized transnational crime, action to increase the availability of medicines, lack of access to the Internet in all corners of South America and to take into account the common and effective risks of natural disasters”.
Since Europe is in the crisis, the "economic unity (Latin America) should not have a triumphant basis, but should serve to expand our production framework and foresee a better future for our cities," Umala added.
"We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 character projects that will improve the linkage of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border zones... by uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes," the Peruan President said in the read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were pertaining to Peru and were limited to cross-axis in its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two were aimed at a great connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide any more details.
The outcome document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to re-accede to the Union of South American nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace, to be united and to have a good relationship between the neighbours, was another theme highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before taking part in the regional meeting, hoping to meet his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico, to negotiate in a respective form of sea dispute as a result of the verdict of the international court confronted by Godote.
"After tomorrow (Saturday), I may meet President Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
"Let us review all these paths, they are not mutually exclusive, including the Nicaragua Covenant will require discussion with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we can deal with this as possible civilized and respectful way," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they are present to the new President of this country, Enrique Penya Neito.
Also, during the branch defence summit, the branch ministers met preliminaryly to approve the Plan of Action for 2013, aiming at strengthening dialogue and unity on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the last part of the countries has been suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
"South America should learn from Europe on national integration: Rafael Correa
President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, reaffirmed today that the establishment of general nationality was a goal in which South America, in that case, should, yes, learn from Europe.
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the South American Union (UNASUR), held in Lima, stated to the public television of Peru that the Europeans “begun killing each other during World War II” and in other conflicts, “even now they are almost one parent”.
It protected, in this context, a draft establishment of South American citizenship approved by UNASUR countries.
"It must be acquired for free movement of citizens and workers across any South American country, as it is already happening to the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactive sectors that want to return us back to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President also showed himself as a party to the resuming of the Organization of American States (OAG) under the prevention of reducing the influence of the English Saxon States and taking into account those who signed the San Jose Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who read the lectures never take any obligations, and we, South Americans, we sign everything.
"It is not clear that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is in Washington and is financed by the United States," he said, implying the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assanjo.
Correa assured that he did not regret that decision, because he did not give up his principles with it, but observed his "deep values of democracy and human rights".
He added that in his time, "there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to the third country and would not be followed."
He also criticized the Swedish justice for the requirement to arrive in its territory for interrogation of the alleged sexual crime, while “the Swedish legislation only considers it possible to implement it through a video conference that could be made from the Embassy of Ecuador in London”.
Correa confirmed that there was a risk of achieving the physical and mental health of Assange.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived in our embassy, but the Ambassador told me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuador head of the State.
What really is, it is the danger of deteriorating his physical and mental health because of the imprisonment in a small space without the possibility of exercise in the air.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum issue of Assanz since June in the Ecuador Embassy in London, through a guarantee of integrity that would allow him to go to Ecuador, was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and emphasized that there were negotiations in London on finding a solution to the problem of WikiLeaks detention.
We do not negotiate human rights; we do not use this word in this case, but there were constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, because Assanja's lawyer, Baltasar Garson, has been conducting a number of processes in various European institutions," he said.
And he expressed his view that "if Britain will provide a guarantee of immunity tomorrow, it will end."
And if Sweden, as greatly permitted by its legislation and as it has already done in other cases, will question Mr. Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London or question him on Skype tomorrow, the problem will be exhausted.
Correa took advantage of being a defender of the freedom of printing and emphasized that he did not endure “the mediation, injustice and lies that distort freedom of expression”.
"The main enemy of freedom of printing are not corrupted politicians, but bad journalists who support profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, he remained pleased that neither the journalists, “neither bankers nor the burjuaz-hegemon countries dominate in Ecuador”, and added that by re-elected, “increasing the revolution to continue development in the right direction”.
Correa also supported the decision to preserve the veto of Paraguay in UNASUR at least before the next elections, contesting that the organization " must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support the revolution under the mask of law," because "it actually destroyed the legitimacy of paraguay democracy".
The Ecuador President also considered his colleague colleague, Juan Manuel Santos, " fully justified " to negotiate with Nicaragua on the marine borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which has proved to benefit from the Nicaraguan marine sovereignty.
This decision is currently disobedient.
This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
We have to process them together to overcome them and move forward.
He also expressed the hope of a good completion of the dispute on the marine borders that lead to the same court of Peru and Chile, and said that “it is right for Latin America to address international institutions if the two countries are obliged to decide, whatever difficult it is.”
With regard to the possibility of speaking as a candidate for the forthcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to ballot for the third term in a sequence, he pointed out that it was considered "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it was quite difficult."
Correa assured that if he loses the elections in February 2013, he will leave public life.
In my personal way, I have never been interested in the authority, but in such unfair situations as Ecuador, the social and economic poverty can be corrected only by the political authorities.
"My political movement felt that I was the one who guaranteed this possibly victory, so it must be recognized," he said.
In the case of victory, this would be my last term in the president's position, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, the same thing.
"This is a decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned the new course of treatment of Venezuela, President Ugo Chavez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicholas Maduro, who told me he went to the treatment that was already planned, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean the health of President Chaves," he explained.
The head of the Ecuador State participated today in Lima in the summit of the Heads of State and Governments of the South American Nations Union (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
Death from AIDS today is a result of later diagnosis
Fabricio was 21 when he was announced that his AIDS analysis had a positive result.
"I'm being deaf," he recalls the hard one, despite the whole doctor's technique, a moment.
The young man hid it from his family.
When he decided to deal with the disease himself, he wanted to know about it as much as possible, and his efforts were justified, he already noted his 43th birthday.
Fabricio is one of the older HIV patients in the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara Hospital (HCG), where he was in 1994, overcome many obstacles.
He's been living with a human immunodeficiency diagnosis (HIV) for 22 years, and at the beginning of the 1990s it would be difficult to believe that there were too few treatment options, too little knowledge of the disease, too predominantly treated with the sick.
So even the director of the Mexican Institute for Social Protection did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
In other words, it was a conviction to have AIDS at that time.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and to do it without a worse quality of life.
Nevertheless, while not aware of their disease, many people still come when the virus has already damaged, the immune system has been exhausted, and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
Following 31 years after the World’s appearance of AIDS, at least after the first statements, the “great achievement for the present time is that survival of the patient who begins treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG, head of HCG, Haime Andrade Villianueva, reiterating that this information was confirmed in April this year in prestigious scientific publication.
Infectionist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villianueva explained that since 2008, scientists concluded that AIDS was not a conviction, but the duration and quality of life depended on the degree of immune system in patients at the start of diagnosis, with the best expected lifetime of those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years, with 200 CD4 and up to 50 years, when 500 CD4 is reported.
Simplely saying, the above means that someone who gets a diagnosis of HIV-positive aged 25, according to these terms, " by maintaining control, can live without problems until 75 years," he explained.
To evaluate this progress, we should recall that the length of the lives of Mexicans today is 76 years old.
Although the mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (the annual report of UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since the AIDS appearance.
Only in Kalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths were already registered to my year; however, it is claimed that there is widespread access to antiretroviral medicinal products since 2005.
- Why are there still affordable outcomes?
- I don't think it's the problem with the treatment.
So I imagine, that's how things are in our hospital.
At least for the last 12 years, we haven't had a lack of medicinal products, the problem is that patients are coming very late because they don't know about their infected condition, i.e. at late stages of disease.
He reported the destructive data: " Nine of the ten patients are coming when they already have any opportunistic infection; what should be done in order to influence the overall mortality, so that diagnosis should be performed at an early stage, and there is a need to be samples for mass detection for all people who will ask for it."
In their proposal, experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Halisco (COESIDA), as well as patients such as Fabricio, who have requested to verify the private lab, only motivated by his friend and despite his youth age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered by the sarkoma Caposha, a cancer tumor, which is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything.
"If I die anyway, I'd better bump three times a week," they said, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I'm eating well, I'm doing exercises, I'm taking medicines.
To this day, his parents only know that he had suffered cancer.
I live a normal life like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of work, I travel, I have a active sexual life, but with both responsibility, I care about myself and another person," said Fabricio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to raise his statements to those now, in the context of the World Fighting AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know whether they are HIV-positive as soon as possible, and if they have a diagnosis already, let them know that they can live like any other person being responsible.
This report summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS in this year 2012.
Condoms on tape
A major disturbance between health programmes and a simple citizen, believes Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalahara, who has dealt with HIV.
And the biggest thing is prevention.
In places devoted to this task, "the condoms have actually increased, once given us one or two, now we are given a hundred packages, and this is very good, but it turns out that there are those who still have no access to condom," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why do you?" This is a popular question, with acquisition and conviction, by social workers, school consultants, pharmacists and health workers, who do not want to hear teenagers, assured a propaganda.
I suggest to change this ineffective distribution; so that condoms are not only on the sides and that there are hundreds of them in public toilets in places often visited by young people.
It's not a promotion of divorce.
It's not about the payment of beer and motel, the Governor Emilio Gonzales replied when he was asked whether condoms could be distributed in his leadership.
"It is not sexuality, it is best to make condoms available to those who have already practiced sexual activity," he noted.
Key data in Kalisco
There are 13.435 summary cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State took the fourth seat in the national rating on the new and summary cases of AIDS and the 13th HIV.
92 per cent of the infections are sexual, 6 per cent through blood and 2 perinal path.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV because there are 4 to 5 people who do not know that.
Given the ratification by the United States Appeal Court of Justice, a decision to cancel the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Group by competitive production in Mexico, the scenario sets up a year precedent for any national branch company in the neighbouring country which has problems with payment capabilities.
The procedures to support the survival of companies authorised by Mexican laws seem not to be valid in the country of belts and stars, in contrast with international agreements.
In the practical field, the approval of the decision made on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale in the court of bankruptcy of the northern district of Texas, leaves the mexican firms unprotected against the possibility of imprisoning their property on the other hand of Rio Grande.
The decision, however, opens the door to the leading glass producer in Mexico to address the Supreme Court of the United States, proving three disagreements.
As an entry, while the judge of the case notes that creditors should be regulated by the United States Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Court of Appeals in New Orleans said that the main proceedings relate to the competitive production considered in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies annulment of international judicial cooperation in cases of non-payment of enterprises of transnational profile.
In fact, for this purpose, the UN Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was established as an arbitrary of the American Institute of Law.
Secondly, the verdict states that without inter-company votes recognized in the critical mass of competitive debt production that had been held before the mother's company of Vitro branches, the majority required to approve restructuring would not be achieved.
Nevertheless, this opportunity is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time that the scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose inter-company debts was guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competition.
It is also true that by reading the votes of the branch offices, Vitro creditors who fought it in the United States courts, namely, the “funds” such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not reach the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
The Court of Appeal has declined these data.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of the difficult situation that has been encountered since 2008 with a serious economic crisis that has struck the United States in the country.
So far, the family company Gonzales Sad will appeal to the Court of Appeal to bring the vote to its captivity, i.e. five judges, in view of only three votes.
In case of failure, a certificate will be lodged, which will require a review of the process by the Supreme Court of Justice, in this case by the United States Supreme Court.
The worst thing that the court rejected the document sent by the Government of Mexico in the role of amicus curiae (the other court), which described the process to be followed by Vitro under the Competitive Production Act, indicating that it was freed from compliance with the agreements signed by the two countries to link it to article 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country was subject to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, i.e. the rules established for inter-State non-payable cases that guarantee equality to debtors and creditors.
Two-board carambol: they beat in Vitro and beat the country.
General balance
In view of the complaints postponed on the table by the trade unions of Mexicana de Aviationon against the former owner of the company, Haston Askarah Andrade, who is accused of fraud, has already found a bottle throat by the Union of pilots of aircraft.
The instance headed by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morino has just submitted the requirement of a criminal case against the National Commission on Banks and valuable papers accused of impeding justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory body systematically refused to report to the Public Prosecutor General on the operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from the trust fund F/589 of IXE 198 million peso, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be aimed at buying stocks from the Professional Hotel Management Company.
As you know, Ascarrah Andrade is the main shareholder of Posadas Hotels.
Surrounded by Dragon March
At the weekend forum at the Caribbean University, a group of local and foreign ecosystems, scientists, businessmen and civil society members approved the establishment of a broad front to resist the opening of Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about the giant sales and dissemination centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean ' s isolated country, with a residential zone near 150 companies.
The Canacintra has previously been able to combine the governors of the south-eastern zone to oppose monumental forces that compared with the land part of the protected territories and threatened the industry.
ACTA Death
The Government ' s reluctance to the senate requirement to explain, under the circumstances and circumstances, the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan had signed the Trade Contrafaction Agreement known as an ACTA abroad, according to the Mexican Institute for Industrial Property, has already been archived.
As you know, the action was carried out, despite discvalifiing the Senate itself the possibility of viewing it as a violating freedom of expression in social networks.
Homex in a long-term perspective

Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector Hetin Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
Hector Hetin Reyes, a busy basketball traveler, has been associated with this sport for over 60 years, and it has led the whole world to go around.
There are few people in Portorico keeping in mind so many basketball stories like Hector Hetin Reyes.
In fact, before the bleeding into the brain attached him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was screwed into sports for over 60 years, as a small categories player, the High Basketball League, the authorized BSN and the head of the Cowboys of Bayamon and the President of the Federation of Basketball.
"I have played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including a few at the same time as when I was President of the BSN, the Director-General of the National Team and the President of the Federation in the 1990s," Reyes recalls during his visit to Primera Hora home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate by making this allegation.
The walls of his home, almost all the pictures and memories gathered for his long way, testify.
Bayamon in the Heart
With the greatest emotions, he kept those who remembered his way through Cowboys, starting from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when his 15-year talk was completed as an agent or a contract agent.
"It was my best years I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy champions since 1967 as an agent, with an agent or manager.
There were many years of joy, including five champions from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, a year of Jerome Minsey's debut in BSN.
From then on, he continued to lead Cooco, Ortis, who was a great administrator,” said Reyes.
I remember that Jean Bartov, who was headed here at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, said to me, "I have a very strong player for you, up to 6'7."
"Would you?"
And it was the beginning of Minsey, one of the best players that had Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommended a sniper of Raymond Gauss, who received citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsey brought Bayamon's championship, Gauss would have helped conquer another.
I enjoyed the Championship of Cowboys with Gauss, but I was already at the distance, because by 1988 I was already the head of the Federation.
At that time, I preferd to enjoy its achievements and achievements in the National Assembly.
I remember the first time we won in the United States during the Olympic qualification tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then the World Championship of 1990, where we received the fourth place, was to be bronze if not the Canadian judge who forced us to overcome the final game, said Reyes.
The 1990 World Championship team is the best group you've ever seen?
It's among the best, just like the one that won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was that from the Pan American games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and broke the U.S. accommodation, which was quite like the one that won our bronze at the world's championship.
In that team, not only were Minci, Gausso, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopeza and Ortiza, but also young (Havier) Colon and James Carter, the brothers of Leon (Francisko and Edgar) and Mario 'Kihote' Morales, who was unable to participate in the 1990s because of the knee trauma.
The team, which may not have been the best in personality, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was a team of the 1995 Olympic qualification tournament in Neukeen, Argentina.
With the role players such as Canito Nivesa, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hurruitner, who were temporarily removed from the Pan American Champion of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all projections.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Piculin Ortis.
His indicators in international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculin did.
And that's not his career in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very complicated question.
We had a very good young boy, including Julio Toro, Flora Melandes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From the young, I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you think is your main achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most famous era of the national assembly between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 1990s, BSN had up to 17 teams in the season.
What do you have to do?
There were things I wanted to realize, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, that boys from Ponce play only in their field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoff.
Now the guys travel and play too much, and that's too much.
At least I see the fruits of mandatory certification and courses for managers, officials and judges.
It's a pleasure to me.
What are you doing now?
I'm listening to music, watching music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and rarely go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy my wife's society, Isabel, who was always with me.
Actor Larry Hagman died.
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Werth, Texas, became worldly famous by his main role as John Ross Euing, more known as J.R., in the Dallas television, in which he had a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role of oil predator J.A. Euinga in the Dallas TV became a symbol of greed in the 1980s.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. in the new Dallas season this year, died on Friday night because of the complications caused by cancer, according to the statement of the family provided for the Associated Press by Warner Bros., the Dallas production studio.
"Larry returned to his favorite town, Dallas, again playing a sign role that he liked most," his family said.
Larry’s family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas at the shop on Thanksgiving Day.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and in Sikvela, was next to Hagman when he died in Dallas' hospital, said her representative Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, loving and talented, and I'll miss him very much.
"He was the original person and lived full of life," Gray confirmed in the statement.
Hegman had diagnosed hepatic cirrhosis in 1992 and he admitted that he had been drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was detected in the liver, and he had transplanted the transplantation.
Long before Dallas, Hagman acquired a famous television by the role of a decent type in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie" translated by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is changing when he meets the attractive girl of Barbara Iden, and starts living with her under the same roof.
He was also the primary character of two comedies that rarely appeared in the air, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the movies included the roles of the criticians in the "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his artistic interpretation of the remarkably disgusting J.R. that led Hagman to the top of glory.
The CBS dramatic series on the Juing clan and other characters in its surrounding was broadcasting from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot J.R.?", designed to create a noise around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character was almost killed, produced international discussions and millions of dollars risked in the booking offices.
It also helped to bring a recorded audience to the series at that time.
When an answer was answered in the November 1980 episode, the average 41 million televizors viewed it and turned Dallas into a second review of the entertainment programme in history, after the final of the MASH in 1983, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R., Christine (in the execution of Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. interrupted her and then threatened her to blame her for prostitution if she did not get out of town, but also others had reasons to attack him.
Hegman played Juing as a non-natural corruption with a charismatic smile: an unfair entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who wanted his wife, Sue Ellen, Linda Grey, to be treated.
"I know what must be on the J.R. grave plate," said Hagman in 1988.
It must be said, "There is an honest citizen of J.R. Ewing."
It's the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, also a heroin of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as a "great one on and out of the screen."
It is unforgettable for millions of worshipers all over the world, and in the hearts of every one of us who has been happy to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new issue of Dallas were shown a few months ago with great success in the TNT channel.
The five episodes of the second season have already been recorded and the sixth was in production, reported the channel.
Warner or TNT have not made statements about what will happen with the series after Hagman's leave.
Fort-Wuerta, Texas, was the son of the actress and singing Mary Martin, who shineed in classic works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she was born in 1931 during her marriage with a lawyer, Ben Hagman.
He tried to be happy at the theater scenes of New York in the early 1950s, and then served at the WFC of England from 1952 to 1956.
When he was there, he met a young Swedish artist May Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many famous people lived.
In 2001 he called his memories "Hello Darlin": Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I have not included anything that would be able to hurt anyone or affect them in any way," he said at the time.
After the transplantation of liver, he began promoting organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients experienced fear.
"I give them advice, give them courage, meet them when they go to operations, and then," he pointed out in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like "Do not be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He also acted actively against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
The course that is studying "The end of the light" begins.
Each week, students study apocalyptic phenomenons such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Sharme decided to read the course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an unreasonable bait: the end of the " long recalculation" of the Mayan calendar, on 21 December, which was captured by many people as evidence of the end of the world.
But Charme had no idea what he was expected in the next few months: the disaster hurricane of Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call the long armageddon, and the growing conflict, where Israel would be involved, the place where Christian theory of the end of time believed that the apocalypse would begin.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," Sharm said this week to students of the University of Rutgers Camden (New Jersey).
If we analyze what is going on in the world now, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember, it's bad for those who have apocalyptic thoughts.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the end of the world in this semester, theoretically the last in history.
In Temple University, Professor Barry Waker reads the "Most Information, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas are spreading through time," he said, and the way hypothetical scenarios are offered to cause certain human actions.
If the nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war can be ruined.
This month, students analyzed the apocalyptic topics and studied how they relate to examples of real life.
"I tried to tell my students about what is likely possible and impossible," Waker said.
At the headquarters of the Pennsylvania University, Professor of History of Latin America, Matthew Restal and his colleague, Amar Solari, adjunct professor of history of art and antropology, joined to read a course called "The End of the Light".
"We do not add '2012 ' to always have the opportunity to read the course again, in case the end of the light does not come," Restall said.
Despite the “indestructive destruction”, students should learn, prepare projects and end-up examinations.
In the Penn State, the final examination will be taken to the Canon of the Apocalypse, which does not leave students a choice but to work " until the night the end of the world, assuming the end of the world," Restal said.
The courses were quite popular.
"The places have ended in two hours," Restall said about his course for students with a high average score, for which 35 students were recorded.
We received e-mail messages for many weeks before the semester began from people who asked if there were rooms.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old student of the Department of Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers Camden.
And the apocalyptic thought, world or religious, is just a matter of comfort or his absence.
Will Vexa, a 25-year-old student of the Psychology and Nurse's Case, said that he was watching all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of the course that would teach this," he noticed.
I like him.
But none of the students questioned -- not mentioning the professor -- said he believed in the date of the end of the light of December 21st.
"Our first project affected the prophecy of May, and somehow we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, 21-year-old student of the last course at the Temple University of West Chester.
Maya has never predicted the end of the world; this is just a key moment in the calendar, said Restal.
He noted, however, that there was an apocalyptic concern in the Western culture, which counted for several centuries, where people responded to changes around themselves, foretold the end of the world.
The Internet has raised these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in the English world.
Joseph Dogerty, a professor of the university of La Sal, who taught courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question whether he knew about a course on the end of the world there.
"The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world," he wrote, implying that the above instance was ordered.
We have mercy from the Pope.
Restal noted that many days of the last court had been spoken for a long time, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, " people will immediately begin to think of the next date" or to philosophy that 21 December was the beginning of the seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers are not sure about this date.
Some said they were going to go to the end of the world.
"Maybe I call some friends to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, 20-year-old communication student.
