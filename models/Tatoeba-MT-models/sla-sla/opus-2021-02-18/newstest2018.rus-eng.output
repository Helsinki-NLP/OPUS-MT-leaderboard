The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, signed a law on administrative responsibility for the violation of the term and order of the payment of goods (work, services) in procurement for public and municipal needs.
The law is designed to address a very severe problem of non-compliance with the contractors in the implementation of public and municipal procurement.
Another two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs were unable to receive payments under public and municipal contracts already completed was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia gave the General Prosecutor ' s commission to take special control of the problem.
Because businessmen themselves were unable to deal with unconscious contractors who had not financed contracts, all attempted to avoid payment obligations and to include illegal conditions in contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country.
Since 2015, 9,7 thousand presentations have been submitted for the protection of the rights of entrepreneurs for public procurement, and 4,5 thousand officials have been brought to the administrative 533, investigative bodies for the organization of processing verifications, and 46 have been criminalized.
As a result, more than 66 billion rubles have been exempted from debt to entrepreneurs.
These huge amounts have not been accumulated as a result of the non-payment of multi-billion contracts.
Basic debts resulted in numerous, systematic delays in paying services to entrepreneurs at more modest amounts.
That's a characteristic case.
The Little Company Manager won a competitive competition for social transport services for several million rubles.
A man has invested all his volunteers, fully fulfilled his obligations, but he has not received the deposed money for a period of time.
The result is a growing financial coma from payments, taxes, credits that would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not requested aid to the prosecutor.
The problem has now been maximised in a number of regions.
However, as at the first half of 2017, the total debt on public and municipal contracts identified by the prosecutors of the Russian Federation was approximately 27.4 billion rubles.
In the regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the prosecutor is working in the manual anti-crisis management regime.
The Prosecutor-General has personally conducted travel meetings with local authorities in which all the prosecutors ' violations and measures are subject to the immediate elimination of them.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslava and Ekateringburg this year.
Improving the payment discipline of public procurement officers could be able to implement Federal Law No. 189-FZ "On amendments to the Russian Federation Code on Administrative offences in the establishment of administrative responsibility of the contracting officers for the violation of the term and order of the salary of goods (work, services) in the exercise of procurement for public and municipal needs", signed last week by the President of Russia.
The draft law was developed by the Mineconomic Development of Russia on the Gen Prosecutor ' s initiative.
The new law will supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative offences of articles, which provides fines from 30,000 to 50,000 rubles for the violation of the contracting officer's term and order of payment of goods, work and services in public and municipal procurement.
If the official has already been punished by the administrative punishment for a similar offence, it is expected to be disqualified for one year to two years.
All prosecutors of the Russian Federation have already received a mandate to ensure that these legislative novels are applied in practice.
The Civil Rights Unit announced a warning on the movement in Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colorful Population has issued a warning for colored people traveling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies of the state and racist attacks.
The statement of the group reads: “The prevention for the traveling National Association for the Promotion of Colorful Population by 28 August 2017 calls upon African traveling, guests and citizens of Missouri to be particularly cautious and to show greater caution in state travels in connection with a number of suspicious racist events that have recently occurred throughout the state territory and which have been brought here.”
According to the National Association for the Promotion of Colorful Population, the group had recently adopted the law in Missouri, which has made people more difficult to win claims relating to discrimination, as well as that the law enforcement authorities of the State have often chosen minority objects.
“You have people who are subject to violations of human rights.
They are stopped on the roads because of the color of skin, beat and kill," said the Cansas City Star, Rod Chapel, President of the National Association for the Promotion of the Colorful Population of Missouri.
“We hear complaints as often as ever before.”
This is the first warning of such a kind as the United States organization.
The Panel referred to incidents such as the degradation of black students on racial ground at Missouri University and the death of twenty-five-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ended up with gasoline during his state trip, and the police of Missouri arrested him without accusing him of a crime.
The warning also refers to the recent report of the General Prosecutor ' s State of Missouri, whereby the probability to be stopped on the road for black drivers by 75 per cent higher than for the white.
“The aim of warning is that people are informed of the situation and warned their relatives and friends and colleagues of what might happen in Missouri” said Chapel.
“People should be prepared in any way, whether they will take with them the money to be bailed or inform their relatives that travel in the state.”
According to the latest report from the FBI on hatred crimes, 100 hatred crimes were registered in Missouri in 2015, which makes the state sixteenth in the State on the number of such violations.
The movement warning is also a response to the new law of Missouri, which will be more difficult to raise a case against a legal person in connection with housing or labour discrimination.
Previously, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Freedoms (ACLU) announced warnings for travellers in Texas and Arizona after these States adopted new laws of immigration control, according to which local law enforcement authorities were prescribed to arrest people for violations of immigration laws that, according to ACLU, a number of racial verifications had to be increased.
Precautions on movement are usually issued by the State Department to other countries, but recently public organizations have responded to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people were killed as a result of the shooting of a police patrol in Egypt
The unknown have shot the police patrol in the city of Isna in Egypt, reports Reuters with reference to the Ministry of Interior of Egypt.
During the shooting, two people, including one police officer, were killed, three were injured.
All the wounded are transported to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed persons in the car opened fire on the law enforcement officers.
One of the detainees was detained, the other was able to hide.
Rosturism supports the law on the cancellation of free baggage for non-return aircraft
The head of Rosturism, Oleg Safonov, stated in the interview of the RBC television channel that " positive" applies to the adoption of a law on the cancellation of free baggage in non-return airlines.
"It is necessary to create conditions where a person who has no luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has the luggage," he stressed.
However, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the fears of citizens, it would not be necessary to pay for the transport of upper clothes and mobile phones in the manual layout.
"It would be right to calm down all of our citizens and tourists and to say that it is to the top of the clothes, to the zontic, to the mobile phone, to iped, or even to any computer," said the head of Rosturism.
Previously, the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, signed a law envisaged the right of airlines to exclude the rule on free carriage of luggage at an unresponsive aircraft.
The issue is that airlines can determine the number of seats and weights of the bags included in the non-return tariff.
Vladimir Putin ordered to eliminate bajkal pollution
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, at the Baykala Protection Meeting, reported that in recent years the significant territories of the lake were extremely polluted.
It commissioned to identify sources of funding, plans and executors for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also commissioned a full revaluation of polluted territories.
"It is also necessary to address the objects that continue to work here, the cleaning structures of most of them are exhausted," quoted the President ' s RIA News.
He also added that the Prosecutor General of Russia had to verify environmentally harmful activities.
He said that there are problems in the area of the lake involving natural garbage and a number of environmental violations from the rest organizers.
"I want to emphasize this: not all in order to verify, but also to know the measure, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and to take appropriate measures," he emphasized.
Precedentally, the Gen Prosecutor reported a reduction in fish stocks in the Lake Baykal and proposed increased number of environmental surveillance facilities.
Recall, on 15 June, Vladimir Putin, during a direct line, stated that legislation was needed to be amended to ensure the rights of civilians living in natural territories of a special security regime.
He was informed of the problems of holding activities by the people of the island of Olhon, which belongs to the Baikal Natural Territory.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donsky, immediately proposed a solution to the problem by clarifying the borders of the Baykal water zone, but in the Government of Buryath, it was recalled that this change was not enough because the limitations were related to a number of regulatory acts.
Previously in the Minechomic, it was proposed that the problem be resolved by changing the Earth Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
A new temple will appear in Southern
In the village of Sosova, members of the community from the indigenous few people of the North of Rahtiña participate in the construction of the Orthodox temple, together with the inhabitants of the Berezov district.
His location is a river shore, the temple will be well seen from far, so it will serve for fishermen with a road lamp.
According to the communities, construction work will be completed this year, now set up by the dome, there are church bells.
The Igrim Navy fleet has provided transport.
The temple is named by the Holy Nicole Miracle, because it is honored by the Orthodox Church as the Protector of Passengers, including fishers.
In the Cosec, the fish industry gives work to the settlers, feeds them.
The local inhabitants are waiting for the temple to open their doors, and children even write about it in school ingredients as local qualities.
Disneyland with a death penalty.
Why do the laws in Singapore respect?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in a dining room in open air.
In commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette per one, but cartons are carefully stored in a iron box taken from the office.
After the end of the conversation, the businessman is heading towards the nearest urna - 100 meters - and throws bulls out there.
Punishment for garbage in public place - $500 local dollars, reports Chang.
You know, since I was a kid, my reflex just worked out: you can't throw a flash from a candy to a bridge, they're being punished right now.
And now, videocams are all over the place.
Indeed, Singapore's trips are clean in the center of the city, like in the museum.
Chang explains: three months ago, his 18-year-old son of his neighbour drew graphite of the wall of the old colonial building.
The court recognised the guy's guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to a rack.
What?!
Imagine it.
He got ten wooden sticks and spent a week in prison.
We don't have any body punishment.
As the highest level of life in Singapore and the unbelievably rigorous laws are combined, the AIF observer was dealt with.
No one here thinks to cancel the death penalty, explains Victor Lee Hong.
The Government has long been concerned with the view of both the European Union and the United States.
If a person takes a large drug or deals with them, he's hanging.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizenship was detained at the Changi airport: he took 400 g of cocaine.
It was protected by the Australian Prime Minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the Pope of Rome.
However, the guy was hanged after all.
After that, the drug couriers are carefully circled by our country.
The following is: in Singapore, the laws are obliged to respect all in order, not only modest and wealthy people.
No matter who you are, the millionaire, the vice Prime Minister, the famous artist or the resident of the European Union.
Option one in this case: if you find a polk of cocaine, you'll be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and you meet a number of warnings everywhere, you're just wondering how much in this city of bans!
For example, the gum tire is sold only in the pharmacists and can be purchased strictly by the physician (!).
The gum tourists will not be removed when they arrived, but it would be worth sticking a "cut" into the metro, fixing $1,000 local dollars.
In four days, I met two people with white tapes on my neck, "I was wasting."
In addition to the fine, the uranium is often convicted to a “court in the palace”: to clean up parks and beaches for a week.
6,000 bucks pay the "criminal" who forgot to wash water in the public toilet, and when trying to make a small need for the housing elevator, a special detector is being blocked and the signal is sent to the police.
Completely exotic laws include the bans on the placing of pigeons on the street, the publicly performing songs and even the excessive flood of the room plant (!) are considered to be attracted by plenty of water to mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers can't carry fires into the metro, otherwise they are punished by 5,000 Singapore dollars.
In general, there's a thought that whatever you try, you're going to break something.
That's not true - he's trying to convince me, Muhammad Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of local tourism.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on the paper, and in the last 20 years, I haven't seen someone get involved for their violations.
Why do they remain?
So that citizens don't relax.
The main rules are monitored inconsistently.
Let's say if a minor is sold cigarettes in a kiosk, they will be punished by all the chain: the owner of the store pays a huge amount, the offender himself gets hits with sticks on the back, and the seller will also be exposed and put in prison.
It is because of such severe laws of offence in Singapore, very rare.
Is that justified?
In the 1970s, we had a mess on roads, car drivers ignored lights, drove as they wanted, drunk for driving.
After the penalties were introduced for a year, everything was calm.
Now the driver, drinking a whiskey, knows that if they stop, the police don't let go for bribes, they'll put a fine at the cost of the apartment, and they'll be sent to prison for years.
Many foreigners in South-Eastern Asia seem to be a variety of concentrating camps.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with death execution" -- a guest from the United States has led to a horrified global wealth of the inhabitants, "surprisingly pure airport" and "occultural nature".
Those things are unnatural, they look artificially, and they should not be.
The first days in Singapore, and you're terrified to throw a paper on the trip, you get caught if you walk into the metro with the ice cream.
But then you arrived in the small India area, and suddenly, the "small break," the bus stops with plastic glasses.
"What's that?", you're surprised.
Here's the singapurs smiling.
Anything happens.
Not for any such a crime, but you should know that if you are calculated, you will not be imposed, for you have violated the law.
Often, it's enough for a man to act normally.
Of course, the authorities in Singapore are fully authorized.
But you know what?
In the Vietnam Hoshimine, I was moving very carefully - motorcycles often pull smartphones and cameras out of the hands of tourists.
In the center of Paris, there's plenty of dirty dudes and beggars.
In our streets, not everyone is trying to throw a trash into the urnas.
Singapore, however, has become the most peaceful, clean and safe city on the earth, because of the collection of dragon fines and unsatisfactory laws (including the death penalty).
You'll think about it.
This is human nature: remember, and in Russia, no one has been trained until they were punished.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not punishment, it is voluntary compliance with laws.
And we should think that in Russia, people would also be pleased with pure streets, no garbage in the subway, and welcome the arrest of those messing the elevator with the public toilet.
Here's the body punishment. Thank you, don't.
The rest of the Singapur laws are at least worth looking after them.
Nothing holy?
Now the White House of Tramp has targeted the Statue of Freedom.
The most reliable sign of modification is when he starts to fight the statues.
The Americans do not understand that worse than everyone else -- from here intentionally the theater of the statue of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Steven Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Government of Tramp, certainly knew what he was doing when he carried a symbolic sewing over the Statue of Freedom during a harsh dispute with CNN Jim Acosta on the proposals of the president on a sharp reduction in legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try the same statue.
The owners of walking ships and artists representing the Statue of Freedom would linch him if he tried to do so.
But he tried to make sense of it, and especially the meaning that it had been assigned to her in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when Emma Lazarus had added the verses to the pedestal.
As Miller cried at Acosta, "I don't want to go deep into history, but the Statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that brightens the world.
The text that you speak was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Freedom."
Miller put the facts right, but as he said, it's not really about history.
This is about the current exciting words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the State invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your poor, your poor, / your crowds dreaming to breathe freely, / The unhappy disadvantages of your abundant shores."
"The unfortunate waste" has never been so visible on our screens.
Miller did not work on literature -- he made it clear that in America, the Tramp was not waiting for them.
This dispute on the meaning of the statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus, and her friends who fought to put her words on the statues after her death, were very well understood that they committed a perfect political act.
The sculpture on purpose was to mark the link between the French and the American Republics through a banal classic figure of women ' s image of freedom.
Lazarus changed its sense: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she received a completely different name: the Mother of the Expelled.
The compound of the verse and image was a brilliant feminist move and a destructive attack against American nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right to change it back.
Rash Limbo, some kind of John Baptizer, who announced the arrival of Tramp in 2010, was thinking that the Freedom does not invite anyone, rather the early neoconservator, bearing the flame of America in the darkness of the world: "Free goes forward.
It brings a torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to light the road to the United States."
Against Limbo's customs, he really got to the point.
The meaning of the statue depends only on the perspective.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see it as it would be seen by poor, unhappy, but full hopes of people on ships after a long and frequent swimming.
This means literally to look at the world with the eyes of people who are looking for asylum and the chance of a better life.
The statue answers them with the words of hope and hospitality they wish to hear.
And of course, that's not the prospect that Miller and Tramp ever want to admit.
Their battery needs not to light the way, but to burn hatred, which is the only source of their power.
The World Championship of 2017: Neil Blake appreciates the Scottish members of Britain.
Ailyd Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots were in Britain.
Neil Blake, director of the Federation of Light Athletics of Great Britain, said that a 16-person Scotland part of the World Championship would contribute to the "significant contribution to the team".
The recorded number of Scottish flatters was selected for the London Championship on Friday 2017.
Blake believes that in Scotland, something special is born and the Federation of Light Athletics of Great Britain should take this into account.
"We know this and we are trying to understand and support as long as they have the potential," Blake said.
"I spoke to people at the Scotland Sports Institute, and they think it's related to what they did.
The Scotland Federation of Light Athletics thinks they have to work with what they did.
The British Athletic Federation: With what they did, we have to work.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why the circumstances were like that, but it's perfectly brilliant."
Some Scotland flavourites claim to be medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 m; and Ayled Doyle has chosen the team to be its captain.
"Aylyd's humble.
Her captain's speech was great," says Blake.
"A lot of light athletes, whether they are Scots or not, and from where they live or train, have come out of this room, feeling pride and spirit of victory.
The passion and sincere feelings that Aylid has invested in it were great."
The silver medal holder of the Commonwealth Championship, who at its Fifth World Championship, runs a distance of 400 meters with obstacles, said that 16 Scots in the British gathering is "unbelievable".
The previous record on the number of Scots at the world championship was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Muir, specialized in a medium-distance race and beat five British and two European records last year.
It's going to run 1500 and 5000 meters.
Chris O'Her, who will take part in the 1500-meter race, is another Scotian to pay attention: he has a good season behind his back, winning the British gathering and the Annual competitions.
Doyle remembers his first world champion, when Lee McConnell was the only Scott in her team.
The captain of the team says she's "incredibly proud" that so many of her companions were not just entering the meeting but in some cases they would claim medals and fight for the final.
"The captain is chosen by other members of the team, so it was a huge honour in any case, but knowing that your companions voted for you and chose you, it was a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who entered the meeting.
This shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all the light athletes that will seek to reach the pedestal of counts.
What about my captain speech?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to take home the World Championship.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the cheerleaders and use that we're going to be again at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to go to his arena and participate in competitions, and the atmosphere would be just great."
Blocking of criticists at Facebook: you must not go to a public position if you are not willing to listen to the criticism of the voters
The founder of our country understood what the critical press was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not prevent them from criticizing him for everything from domestic policy to his political principles.
Of course, he was irritated by the criticism.
But he didn't shut up his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "You can take the freedom of speech, and us, deaf and nonsense, will lead like a sheep to the slaughter."
Now I'm going to go to Governor Maryland Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subjects blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Union of Protection of Civil Freedoms brought him to court.
The submissive governor has called this case inadequate, and the commentary on the Internet was written in the spirit of "yeah and what".
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But that's important too.
And that's especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is an incredibly popular Republican governor in the democratic privilege of the State.
It is second in the country's approval rating of 50 governors.
Hogan is not a stubborn reaction.
He demonstrated a firm hand in the governance of the State and commitment to its principles.
He also uses Facebook as a primary means of communication with his voters and has made jokes to show his hairy head on his page after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the Governor ' s website - which is stated as an official public forum and is conducted by the administration on the taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In the Washington Post interview, the press secretary Amelia Chess defended the governor's actions, claiming that the blocking of comments was just their modernisation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers, and haeters that are violent on the Internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people that Hogan blocked.
And these are real people, not trolls, teachers, businessmen, pastors who address their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, content and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan as a Catholic.
The Lawyer of Lakshma Sarma Raman from Bouie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hatred crimes.
"I wrote a pleasant comment that I was disappointed in the lack of his reaction to hatred crimes and other news of the latter," she wrote in the section of comments to the article in the Post.
"I also don't like the idea that when many people leave comments to the same theme, some say that it is a so-called scroll, instead of acknowledging that they are dealing with a large group of dissatisfied citizens."
What the governor's subjects call "concentrated spam attack", others would probably call an active lifelong position.
In the Facebook era, it is easy to edit your image, just blocking criticisms or washing negative comments.
This is much less dust work than before, when people were required to be sent, collected and burned newspapers with critical fronts or arrested and shut their mouth up.
But that's exactly what's going on right now, just in a digit.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticised for not listening to Facebook and other social networks.
The President Tramp was filed a complaint from the Twitter users who were invoked in his Twitter account.
One of the first, turning decisions on this topic was taken this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge of Alexandria, James C. Casheris, the Chairman of the County Observer Board of Laudon violated the First Amendment by banging the voter in his Facecbook account.
And in Kentucky, the Republican Governor Matt Bevin made claims to the American Union for the Protection of Civil Freedoms for his conduct at Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of accessible mail expenses was about the same reverse as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers grew four, and the authors of anonymous letters have severely distorted his authority.
And even then Washington dealt with anonymous trolls.
People under the aliases of Yuricola, Valerieus, Belizerius and Porcius wrote letters to the newspapers laughing at Washington's decision.
According to historical documents gathered by the online project " George Washington Documents ", his office was filled with petitions criticising his position on the Treaty on Friendship, Trade and Seaship.
But he didn't try to make them shut up.
Freedom of speech, inadequateness and speech is the basis of our State.
And true leadership means consent.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renesans Club
The former champion of Europe, Ronan Rafferty, hopes for the next three days of renesans club in East Lottian, to take the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for older sportsmen.
The Northern Irish crop, who led the neighbourhood of the Archerfield Links club, was moving towards the final round last year until Paul Ilsa lost, was attached to a new place and served as a representative of a tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the Jerry Sarvadi Club.
"I saw the renesans club building, and we see it coming to success with this event," Rafferty said.
“The players will see this field at his best moment, it is in great state.
Jerry did a great job making this place.
He is a strong commitment to this game and is proud of his achievements here.
This is an excellent demonstration for this field."
The English Ils is eager to wait for the first time to stand on a championship title, despite his 32-year-old career in both the European tournament and the European Challenge Tour tour.
"It's a really special sense," said the player from Southport.
"I couldn't try to win "Extremadura Open" again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
Return to this corner of the world is magic.
It's a beautiful place for a golf game.
The memories were returned last year, and my wife and I had a very impressive impression of winning last year.
It was a really special time, and we will always remember it."
It returns to battle on the homeland of Gary Orr, who joined the European tournament for older sportsmen after he had completed 50 years earlier this year.
This event will be his first appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"When you play at home, it is always a little more important," said the inhabitant of Helensboro Orr.
"You want to act well, but you feel this extra burden."
I was happy to play again, and I showed a good golf.
I am pleased with how everything is still working."
The trio will be joined by the former winner of the Masters and Major Champions for older sportsmen Paul Brodherst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Captain Rider Cup Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the field; others are Andrew Oldcorn, Steven McCalister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drammond.
The tournament is free and the parking lot is 5 pounds per hour if one person is in the car, and 10 pounds if a person is two or more.
All revenues go to the British Prostate Cancer Fund.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
The type of tunnels over the roads capable of absorbing car oxide carbons are already being tested on the roads of Great Britain.
The transport agency of the country, as reported in the Autocar, reported on the positive results of the 100-metral tunnel tests established on one of the highways in the north.
The tunnel of 6 meters is built from some of the latest polymer materials that are capable of absorbing harmful substances contained in car explosions.
However, the creation of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the largest measures that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the British will expand the network of power stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of activities to reduce road flows, expand the use of commercial transport on electrical weapons and modernize the heavy truck park.
In official statistics, a quarter of all atmospheric pollution is transported, and unsatisfactory air quality is caused by up to 40,000 preliminary deaths a year.
Mosgorsud has changed the punishment of Majmaev to punishment
Mosgorsud has changed the penalty of Anton Mamaev, who was convicted for four and a half years of the colony, to a fine of 200,000 rubs.
TACS reported that.
The prosecutor had previously asked the court to replace the term for the conditional, explaining his request by explaining that Mommy's disease "has prevented him from finding it in prison conditions".
28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years of imprisonment with a punishment in a colony of the general regime for the breakdown of the former specialist.
On 19 July, the tribunal at a trip to the SISO released a man from detention.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian Goldland
Preparing lunch, Bardin Degei does not use a tile.
She's rarely used.
In its wooden house in Enarotala, the capital of the district of Pania in the rebel Indonesian province of Papua, the housekeeper usually simply places a sweet potato called “nota” in the flames.
In a half hour, the squirreled club gets and eats with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degei is sitting on the earthly floor — she has no furniture — and this is where she does her housework, such as a washing of clothing with mutted water from a mud nearby.
The bathroom serves a brown in a room without a roof.
She's the youngest of four wives of her husband, so she has not been assigned to work in the field.
There's a multi-wife here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
“No one decides to walk around the village after 5 a.m.” she said.
This is a rare opportunity to view the daily life in Papua, the former Dutch Colony, which was joined in Indonesia in 1969 after a suspicious referendum, when only 1026 elders had been forced to vote publicly before occupiing troops.
The existing movement for independence against the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Government of Jacarda, which maintains strong control over the region without allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent State of Papua New Guinea took the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is the city as distant as abandoned; the road includes a half-hour flight from Jayapura, the provincial administrative centre, in Nabir, and then a five-hour rental car.
There's no public transport here.
The city with a population of around 19,000 is composed of wooden houses covered by bamboo fences; the roofing roofs of the hofred were decorated by rust into different red shades.
Not many Indonesians came here, not to mention journalists, and almost none of the aliens.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, my papuas worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
“We were unusual to wear this clothing”, said Degei, pointing to his bright, hand-hand turbana, dark suit and a bright shirt.
"We used to wear only leaves on the body."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population live in poverty and the level of child mortality and literacy among the worst in Asia.
But it's also an Indonesian gold land.
The largest in the world and the most profitable gold mine, Grassberg, belonging to the Freeport McMorann company in Phoenix, is only sixty miles from Pania, a highest mountain province of approximately New Jersey, where 153.000 people live.
Only in 2015, the Freeport company obtained gold and copper for about $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua can be commended by forest stocks of $78 billion.
These wealths, however, will bring for the papuas one unhappy, guaranteeing that the powerful armed forces of Indonesia maintain their drowning presence here.
According to the New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid to local military officers and units nearly $20 million, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands for greater autonomy by the papauas threaten the existence of this golden shelter and are impatient.
According to human rights defenders, since 1969, Indonesia's military forces have been killed by more than 500,000 papuas, and thousands have been raped, tortured and deprived of freedom.
In the adoption of the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass murders in the inhabited indigenous inhabitants of Papua highheats in the 1970s can be considered genocide.
Only last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything”, the report published by the Brisbane Eparchy in 2016, contains evidence of believes committed in the previous year, such as punishment without a trial, torture - especially the parts, as stated in the second report, rape and defeat by electricity - and the cruel overcome of peaceful demonstrations.
“It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because events occur every week,” said Andreas Harsono, studying in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The Gaiki has been delayed because Papua's resources have attracted migrants from other areas of Indonesia.
3.5 million province populations comprise 83 per cent of Christians, but demographic indicators are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrived from dense Indoneian islands - Java, Sumatra and Sulaveza arrived.
The Javan labs, "warungs", sell a baked chicken and a mixture of "gado-gado" fruits that are delivered with nut sauce.
Local inhabitants are trying to endure competition.
“The Immigrants began to sell chicken and vegetables cheaper than the indigenous inhabitants of Papua”, explains Abeth Jou, a twenty-four-year-old Pania, who moved to Jayapur, the provincial administrative centre, because of work.
“The indigenous inhabitants of Papua, mother-mama (women) of Papua, have lost their market.”
The President of Indonesia, Joco Vidodo, known as Jocovi, swore to engage in inequality and violations of rights in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the Presidential Palais in Jackarta, the former carpenter was engaged by supporting 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Pania.
But in Papua, there was almost nothing to change, and locals feel loyal.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jockey in 2014, expecting it to fulfil our hopes for reconstruction of justice," said Jou.
In fact, only two months after the October inauguration, Jockey Paniai survived the tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas hymns at the Enarotala island, when two Indonesian soldiers broke out of the darkness on the motorcycle.
Intimidated children told them that they should be incorporated.
According to the local pastor Javedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was insulted by their tongue, and a little later he returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who were drunk were chasing children and beating them by examples of guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One child, a 16-year-old Julian Amo, was beaten so much that he fell in a coma.
A few hours later, someone burned the government building near the electoral commission, and the next day the situation increased.
About a thousand papuasian men, women and children gathered in the football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bowls and filled the white, the papuasian tribe dance of my pago, running rounds and imitating bird singing.
Some protesters began to throw stones into police office and military base.
When the situation struggled, the interior radio soldiers were commanded: “If the crowd has been resisted more than three times, shoot them,” he sounded as officially said in the document seen by the correspondents of the TIME magazine, but not published in local media.
The fifty-sixth-year-old Jeremias Kayame, head of the region of Kogo Koto in Enarotala, felt the danger and called for calm by asking the crowd to walk away from home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I returned, my left wrist suddenly got a bullet," he told the TIME magazine, standing on the shelter of his brightly colored wooden house.
Kayama still doesn't know who was shooting, but he says that the bullet arrived from the series of soldiers gathered.
“There was a crowd, there was a lot of shots,” he added.
The local inhabitant of Alphius Joab was three times hit, as told by his cousin who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that it is," said the TIME magazine Johannes, which, like many Indonesians, only uses one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
General Yotge Mende, Chief Police Inspector, told reporters that his officers had only “protected” their base because it was attacked.
"We must be protected when people threaten to kill us," said in 2015 the representative of the police of Papua, Commissioner Pujo Sulistio.
“It is a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and much more injured.
The news about murders came to Jackart just the next day.
Three weeks later, Jocque made a dirty speech in Jayapur, expressing his condolences to the families of victims and swore to deal with historical abuses of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be resolved immediately, so that it never happens again," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister for Security, Viranto, said that he would establish a non-judicial organization to end historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately the replies went.
“The majority of the violations have occurred a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 90s or at the beginning of the zero.
The point is, we definitely want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be done," he said.
Then Viranto renounced his words, saying to the TIME magazine on 5 June in Jacard, and said that he did not plan to establish an organization for the consideration of complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “All will be resolved through the court.”
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of “the crimes against mankind” in connection with more than 1,000 deaths during a bloody vote for the independence of East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the incident in Pania.
Families of victims in Pania have met such statements with dark disagreement.
"I have been questioned four times in the last three years, but there has not been any changes," says Johannes.
"I'm tired."
He says years later he still lives in fear.
"I am afraid," he said.
"I'm afraid I'm being arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'm shot."
His brother Jacob also felt that the inhabitants of Pania were afraid to discuss the event.
He said he was beaten by troops after he helped bury four victims.
After we buried the bodies, the soldiers came after me.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot village residents in the neighbourhood of the District of Deiai.
During the struggle between rural residents and the construction manager who refused to help take a man unconscious to the hospital, one person died and another 17 were wounded, including children.
A man, a twenty - four - year - old Ravianus Dove, who was drowned during fishing in a nearby river, died on the road to the hospital.
The angered villagers protested before the construction site of the company.
According to the police, villagers were throwing stones into officers who responded to warning shots.
However, locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonean Specialist) had shot the crowd and killed one person.
"We were in such panic, we are afraid of revenge," said the TIME magazine, the 20-year-old Domingu Badia, who lived near the hospital and saw the wounded rapidly delivery.
“I was hiding in my house for two days.”
Parliament Deiai requested the officers involved in the incident to respond, and the mobile police brigade was withdrawn from the region.
Pania was always a sick place for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of significant development causes displeasure of the tribes of the limits, monas, data, and damales displaced throughout the territory covered by the green of the central high mountain areas of Papua.
Many joined the Movement for Free Papua (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to protect the rights of papuas by promoting sporadic attacks and attacks on the kidnapping of people against Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kohaya.
As a response in recent years, thousands of people in Pania were arrested and immediately detained by military forces under the proposal for “protection of national independence”.
Some have never returned.
Among the population of Papua Pania is considered “the sad place forgotten”.
Poverty increases displeasure.
A small rice selling in Enarotala is too expensive for local people.
The bread is unavailable at the same level.
People here grow everything they feed — mostly notes, as well as some fruits and sheets.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of which can take care of four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Usually, they preserve a majority of family fertility, and the rest is sold in the local market.
Ten club notes are only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
In time, economic inequality between indigenous papuas and new migrants arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new aircraft to Nabire airport.
A few existing vacancies usually get more educated and rich migrants.
Papuas rarely have enough money or skills to manage their own competitive business.
“Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there is no job or money," says John Gobai, chairman of the Tribal Council of Paniai.
The isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
Furthermore, international media restrictions remain strong.
Earlier this year, French journalists, Frank Escudi and Basil Lonchan, were deported from Papua for “insufficient agreement with the relevant organizations” despite their rare permissions for video recording.
According to Felim China, the Deputy Director of Asia of Human Rights Watch, the promises made in the pre-electoral campaign of Jockey to cancel media restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“Now, foreign journalists trying to report from the rebel Eastern Indonesian Provinces, Papua and Western Papua, are facing new dangers: visa refusals and black lists,” he said.
The lack of attention from the press means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is mainly limited to direct neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “varient and widespread violations” in Papua, including the shooting at Pania.
The same countries backed OPM in the past.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arramanate, Nasir, dismissed the statement of the group, informing the journalists in Jacard that “In Indonesia still exists a democratic system and there is a free press, so the evidence of human rights violations would be difficult.”
Local inhabitants want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Netherlandsian Human Rights Ambassador, visited Jayapur on 4 May, the local inhabitants violated the silence, please, “We want freedom”, as the source, which was also present at the meeting, but wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections were held in 2019, but the papuas said that they would not vote again for Jockey.
"Jocovi is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people involved in the shooting in Pania," said Gobai, chairman of the tribal Council.
He wants Jokow to know that the people of Pania, except that they live in a shadow of threats by the greedy army, are in poverty, and their education and health are in a pathetic state.
Gobai says that the inhabitants of Pania, like other papuas, consider their voice devoted to Jockey, the debt that he should pay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he said.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of shooting in Pania have led to the last symbolic act of non-compliance: they buried the body of one of the victims on the ground directly against the police and military station.
Knowing that justice is probably never incurred, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
“The members of our family have been killed,” says Jacob, without lifting their heads.
"What else were we supposed to do?"
The second time fire covers the Dubai Sky Sky of the Fakel
The fire caught one of the world’s highest sky roofs in Dubai on Friday, forced hundreds of inhabitants to leave the seventy-fifth floor structure at 337 meters high.
It's already the second fire in the high building, which is, in coincidence, called "Fakel" in two years.
The building had been evacuated, human victims were not reported, and there was no operational news about the cause of fire.
"We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor,” said the Reuters, a resident of the skybeach called George.
According to the civil defence management of the city of Dubai, fire teams fired at about 4:00 a.m. in local time (00:00 to Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that shelter was working on the asylum of the victims.
The incident may return to the agenda issues of security of materials used in exterior high buildings throughout the world.
During the investigation by the Fachel administration after the fire in 2015, it revealed that the plaque was most affected — the external panels used to form and isolate.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that the system of isolation and plaque panels of the building of Grenfel Tower in London could accelerate the dissemination of what happened there in June, which resulted in some 80 people.
Tourist flow growth in Ida-Virumaa was minimal in June
According to the data made by the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017 the hotel services of the North-Eastern hotel companies were used as a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, with 125 or 0,6 per cent more than previously in the same period.
The number of local tourists fell down, and foreigners grew.
Thus, the foreign tourism increased by 7.3 per cent (544 per cent) in June to 7994 tourists.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2 per cent from 12.944 to 12.525.
The number of Russian tourists in the region has increased most significantly by 8.9 per cent or by 318 per cent compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, 3885 guests from RF stayed at the hotels of Ida-Virumaa.

The television leader, Andrew Malahov, was now on vacation and has not signed a release application from the First Channel.
The situation with dismissal may be clear in the coming days.
Five soldiers died in Afghanistan during the car explosion
At least five troops were killed in the explosion in the Afghanistan province of Gilmand, RIA News reports.
According to the police, a minened car exploded next night next to the army block on the trip.
It's known for 20 deaths.
There was a new HP in Girisk on Friday morning.
Armed offenders attacked the exchange of currency.
The shooting between attackers and security forces continues.
Dyver took his shark's taste camera on the video.
The Dyver and researcher Greg Scomal (Greg Scomal) have been printed on a video shark that bite his axen camera GoPro.
The Rolic presented at Facebook an American Maritime Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, whose staff is Scomal.
The incident occurred on 2 August at Cape Code Peninsula in the north-east of the United States, elaborating the Necn portal.
The man tried to take the shark off the camera he kept on a special stick.
When a man was noticed, the animal long over three meters flew to him.
The shark accepted to bite the camera, and she did not try to attack a scientist.
Scomal explained that the predator did the same way to determine whether the boyfriend was eaten.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that such behavior of a marine animal had been shown to new scientists.
The cause of a mass fight in the Ural Military Centre has become known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District had arrived in the Elitan Training Centre, where a mass fight occurred.
Some details of this battle have already been known.
According to the Mash page of the Contact, the contractors of the Ural Military Part No. 31612 struggled violently because of the unmanaged bed.
It began with the fact that the soldier named Sayan demonstratively ignored the officer's order to charge the turbulence.
The officer's side was set up by the soldiers from the sixth mouth.
Sayana supported the first mouth.
In half an hour, 140 young boys were destroyed in the bed and canvas, and stacked glass.
More than ten people suffered in the mass fight.
In the CFI, the information on the subsecution was denied.
The study showed that at least one fifth passengers in the United States were carrying prohibited items into the aircraft.
The study showed that more than 20 per cent of air passengers were consciously or accidentally carrying in the baggage of the aircraft through the surveillance of the United States Transport Safety Administration, including at least 6 per cent of the aircraft, had been sitting on the plane without surveillance with banned knives or other sharp objects.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally arms, ammunition or explosives.
Study conducted by the charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and covering more than 1,000 people also showed that young passengers were more inclined to break the rules.
From the respondents who recognized that they consciously tried to fly with something that was prohibited by ATB, 19.7 per cent were millenniums compared to less than 15 per cent of the X generation.
The ATB staff are consciously mostly carrying out food and water.
More than 3 per cent have recognized that acute items have been carried through surveillance, and 2.2 per cent of women's respondents and 3.7 per cent of men have admitted that they were deliberately carrying prohibited medicines on the plane.
The company stated that she studied passengers throughout the country to find out how many of them were accidentally smuggling through surveillance at airports, and how conscious they did.
It is expected that mostly, conscious or unconscious, smuggling is being carried out through the surveillance of those who fly most.
According to the company, the ATB rules are quite complicated and confused.
People often do not know exactly what fluids they can carry and in what amount.
It is therefore not surprising that most of what ATB selects is forbidden liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB could consider books prohibited.
Liquids are permitted on internal flights, but not international.
Chapter EPA Pruitt refuses to defer the implementation of the Emission Reduction Rules of the Obama
The following day after the 15 states' investigation, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency cancelled its decision to defer the implementation of the rules adopted in the Obama to reduce the emissions of air polluting and educating capacities.
Pruitt explained his decision by explaining that his agency was now more than in previous administrations, the needs of the environmental regulations of individual States.
He did not mention a complaint against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute was deployed on 1 October, to which States should ensure compliance with the ozone standards of 2015 at the ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone their respect for one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "responding to local decisions or obstacles to economic growth".
Pruitt, who was appointed President Tramp to his current position, was the prosecutor-General of the state of Oklahoma, long ago known as a consistent opponent for environmental improving standards.
After moving to Washington Pruitt, he repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of the rules against chemical or gas oil industry.
The unexpected change in the course on Wednesday is a regular legal defeat taken by Pyitt to return to previous standards.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA chap. exceeded its powers, trying to defer the implementation of the rules adopted by the Obama Administration that require oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce the emissions of metan.
In the statement issued on Wednesday night, Pruit suggested that, sharply changing the ozone standards, he had simply fulfilled the obligation of EPA to cooperate with States in a comprehensive process of timely implementation of new standards.
"In the previous administrations, the EPA could often not be placed within the deadlines, after which he was waiting for a complaint from groups of activists and other persons and discussed the deadlines during the settlement of the case," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen claims against EPA at his previous post.
"We do not believe in regulating through trials, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously our statute and the authority that it gives us."
Nevertheless, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may at some point reuse its "supplies for delaying and other law-based powers" to ensure that the "scijdfys" standards are in clear course and all available information.
The Republicans in the Congress insisted on a broader review of ozone rules.
The draft law approved by the Chamber of Representatives last month seeks to defer the implementation of the rules of 2015 for at least eight years.
The Senate has not voted on this matter yet.
The prosecutor General of New York, Eric Schneiderman, who was headed by the coalition of the states that sued against EPA this week, said that the group was intending to continue legal pressure.
"The change in the EPA course -- after our claims -- is an important victory in the fight for health and security of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by their cities," said Schneiderman.
New York has joined California, Connecticut, Delaver, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rod Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the district of Colombia.
Ozone at the ground level arises when ordinary polluting substances from vehicles, electricitys, oil processing and chemical factories and other sources enter the atmosphere with sunlight.
The arrival could cause serious respiratory problems in the sensitive people, leading to thousands of early deaths a year.
Health and Environmental Protectors welcomed the unexpected change of Pruitt's course.
"It's awful to think about how much pressure it took to achieve this absolutely logical step from a man who is assigned to protect the air we breathe," said Laurie Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Tramp administration and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests."
The IAAF Congress extended the elimination of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations (IAF) voted for the extension of the elimination of the Universal Federation of Light Athletics (FLA).
Thus, the Congress supported the IAAF Council on the Reconstruction of the FLAA, which issued a report on Monday, in which it recommended that the removal be left in force.
166 people voted against 21 for the extension.
The report of the Board of IAAF stated that BFLA had made significant progress towards the achievement of the conditions established by the Reconstruction Council, but these conditions have not yet been fully met.
Because of the disqualification of BFLA at the World Championship in London, Russian flags were forced to speak under the neutral flag.
The team included 19 people allowed to be IAAF.
The IAAF was immediately disqualified in 2015.
The report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound was then published, which addressed numerous violations of the WADA regulation authorized by Russian officials and sportsmen.
For more detailed information on the last report of the Board of IAF, see "A" IAF extended sanctions on the FLAP.
Offensive defeat
During the threeth round of the Russian Fonbeth Championship, the new Moscow Chemical teams had a trip game against the FC of Caluga.
For more than 10 days ago, the rivals played between themselves in the Russian cup, but this time the game was completely different.
Chemistry has not declined to the opponent, but secondary relaxation at the end of the match has led to an insulted naked and fiasco.
After the recent defeat of the colleagues with the account of 0:3, many previously prophesied the victory of the masters.
However, since the meeting, the new Moscows had been forced to count and act from the defence, but from the position of force.
In the 1st time, the colleagues were more constructed and had the advantage of having the ball.
Another very qualitative match was held by Alexei Syrotin, who repeatedly affected the dangerful strikes and gave confidence to his partners.
Unfortunately, the Chemical Attack lacked effort and happiness to put Caluga's defense in a trap and to put the first goal out.
After the break, the game began to run at the meeting courses.
The new Moscows played more actively in the attack.
The alarming bells for our team were defense errors that allowed the colleagues to create a number of sharp moments.
10 minutes before the end of the Chemistry meeting, he took over the territorial advantage and took several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the colleagues played its role -- they were more literally and coldly ending, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After the Dangerous Attack, the Chemistry transferred the ball on the corner, which was transferred to the gate without resistance.
The naked author was Yuri Dubrovin.
In the reporting meeting, Chemistry showed a good game, but he suffered an injurious defeat.
Our team is waiting for another exit -- on 11 August at 19 o'clock in Moscow at the Torpedo stadium named Edward Arrowsov, the new mosques will struggle with the favorite of the Centre of the Ararat FC, comprising Roman Pavluchenko, Marat Ismail, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come back the Chemistry!
Place and time of meeting of new Moscows - 6:30 min. near Magnolia shop (Eastern, d.2, corp.
Chemistry: Syrotine, Manochin (k), Romachenko, Shajunov, Homutov, Gogia (Oreškin), Dudajti, Rižov, Holidays, Belian (Adoevcev), Andreichenko (Lygin)

According to telecommunications published, Tramp pressed Mexico on the payment of the wall on the border
The Washington Post newspaper published the decryption of telephone conversations between US President Donald Tramp and Mexico and Australia's leaders.
On 27 January, during a telephone conversation with Mexico President Enrique Peney Natay Trump insisted that he would stop publicly claiming that he would not pay for the planned wall on the border.
The President of the United States condemned him for speaking publicly against the wall, and according to the information provided, he said: “You can't say that to the press.”
Tramp began its pre-electoral campaign with a promise to build a wall along the south border of the United States and pledged that Mexico would pay for the project.
His first telephone conversation with Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull, was also exposed to a hot restraint.
Tramp said to Ternbull that the agreement under which the United States should accept refugees to Australia " ridiculous " , " disgusting " and " dumb " , and insisted that due to the agreement concluded by Obama's administration, it would look like an idiot because he was intending to stop the displacement of refugees in the United States.
Tramp finished his conversation, saying to Ternbull that "this was the most unpleasant conversation all day."
The bodies of tourists killed in Abkhazia have been shipped by a plane from Sochi to Petersburg
A plane belonging to the Russian airline, on which the bodies of the Russians died in Abkhazia, flew out at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to Saint Petersburg, transmitted by TASS.
At the end point of the investigation, the board will meet the ritual agency and the city's mayors, told the journalists the Deputy Minister for Court and Tourism of Abkhazia, Astamir Ahba.
Previously, the ICS representatives of the Republic stated that all the costs associated with the delivery of bodies to Russia had taken over the Government of Abkhazia.
Furthermore, the official Suhum intends to pay compensation to the families of the victims of 500,000 rubles.
As Ahba said, Abkhazia's leadership was willing to pay off to the victims of tourism explosions and residence in the Republic, but the relatives sent only the confidentiality of local authorities to the Republic to act in accordance with the order set.
At approximately 16:20 in Moscow, the village of the Primorian Gudautic Area at the arms of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Defense, which began to detonate large-caliber missiles and other ammunition.
The combustion of the warehouse, which caused uncontrolled explosions of different modification missiles, has resulted.
As a result, two Russian citizens, Elena Polakov, died in 1970 and Elena Timothy's birth in 1962, which were at rest near the serum source.
64 persons, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 Abkhazia, were transferred to the health institutions of the Republic with different gravity injuries.
At present, there are seven people in the stationary, the others are expelled.
The examination of the Russian impact on American elections will take place by a large jury
The Russian Prosecutor Robert Mueller called for a major jury in Washington, which will study the impact of Russia on the elections of the President of the United States in 2016, reports the Wall Street Journal and the Reuters Agency.
The great jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The gathered materials will be examined by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to be charged.
The summary of the great jury gives Mueller additional powers to collect testimony.
One of the investigations of the jury's colleague that started a few weeks ago will be the details of the son's meeting, then another candidate to the Presidents of Donald Tramp with the Russian Lawyer, Natalia Wessellian.
To check the details of the meeting held in June 2016, Mueller also promised.
They're already studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump, the younger, expanded his lawyers.
The Tramp Junior had previously told him that he was expecting to compromise the headquarters of the candidate from the Democratic Department of Hillary Clinton, but no disclosure documents had been presented and the event was adopted.
At the beginning of August, a number of media reported that Tramp Junior's statement of meeting with the Vessel was literally directed by the senior Tramp.
In the White House, it was clear that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, what any father would do.

Of course, there's no cosmodroma in Mexico or weapons.
However, a space agency was established in 2010 and the desire to develop its own space programme.
And the installation of Yuri Gagarin's bureau is the reverence of the first person who was in space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period in some countries, the Memorials of Gagarin are “against the planet”.
In 2012, the monument was established in the United States Houston near the former NASA headquarters.
In London, the monument in the territory of the Royal Observatory was established on the 50th year of the first flight to space.
There is a monument of Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfut, where our cosmonaut was visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlov Varah, Czech Republic, evacuated in 1992 by public protests and was transferred from the city center to the square before the local airport.
In the 70s of Gagarin, the monument of Yurius Gagarins appeared in Riga.
This is the name and name of the first cosmonaut in Latvia, and it looks like he was 70 years old.
Morse Ford's murder: Activists will lose Lynch's courts on the stage to call for justice.
In 1948, Ford Mercury traveled past the audiences in the village of Monroe, Georgia, and he screamed to the small Morse Ford bridge.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver traveled to the bridge, a group of white men with guns prevented it.
The chief man of the mid-year-olds in a suit in a thin lane - took a cigarette and looked through the wind glass.
The sitting inside trembled from fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" said a man.
"Get him out of the car!"
The pronsible screams broke the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this horrible scene, which took place on July 22, is just a script.
But when Roger's neck was thrown into the neck, almost all the sighters really stopped breathing.
Since 2005, activists returned to Morse Ford Bridge to regain the night in 1946, when the lulluxclanovans lining two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one was convicted for these murders.
"It's amazing that in all these years, no one was arrested -- although we see them next to us; even though we know who they are," said Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the play.
"It's a dot in our history and it's a stone on our souls."
71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the George Congress, who has been fighting for human rights all his life.
For him, the spectacle is a dramatic call for action and an annual reminder to Monroe people that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want investigations, we want to finish, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we must get justice," he said.
"We can't go to healing and reconciliation until we reach justice."
The coroner covers the body of one of the victims of linching at Morse Ford on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBls, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of linching.
But no one has ever been charged.
While suspects have been free for decades, human rights defenders say that the city had always known two linked motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ' s decision for the first time allowed black citizens to vote for the primeries that had to take place in that summer.
Approximately during the same elections, according to the FBI, a black customer Roger Malcolm hit Barnett Hester's knife, the white landlord, apparently because of the woman.
Brooks said that he had been sleeping with Malcolm Dorothy’s wife, and that the child she had to be born was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 to release Malcolm from prison.
He went to jail with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove out of jail and approached Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of linchers surrounded the car.
"It is clear that he has organized and commanded Harrison's murders," the conclusion is made in one of the FBI reports.
"It is also obvious that there was an agreement between the law enforcement authorities of the State and the city, which not only participated in murders but also destroyed evidence and hid witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt to electoral rights," he said.
"They are all killed to send a signal to the black people in the city: if you register and vote, the same will be with you."
For nearly ten years, Cassandra Green runs an annual spectacle that reproduces the lenching at Morse Ford Bridge.
Its spectacle is supervised, it captures the observer and tells about the deep racism that, as many would think, there is no more in America.
It's hard to look at it and to turn away, but Green thinks that it's the most important thing.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they show us our own uglyness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear what I've been through."
The spectacles this year began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 white actors -- dozens, others black -- gathered in the room and listened to the play review over the years.
Wade Marbo was a director with Green.
He played the role of the chief member of the clan for several years, but he said that the role had not become easier.
"I feel like I'm screwed up because it's not the person I am," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back at that time."
In the room of the actress, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, reiterate their roles.
The spectacle begins with that Malcolm, angered by Hester sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nigger, get out of my house!"
Rascon screams in reply.
It's blowing.
And at the same time, all (at least all black actors) are hohot.
Green laughs louder than anyone else.
"What's wrong," asks Ascon.
He's concerned and embarrassed.
Am I reiterating?
"No," said Green through laughing.
"I just don't think the white men said "Norga" then."
"Yes, yes," one of the black performers laughs.
"You've got to make a firm 'r'."
Energy is also changing in the room: discomfort is changing the sense of society.
Everyone must do it right, not only for the play, but for the memory of four people killed.
The scene begins at first.
This time Rascon says the word "n", it is made clear and sharp.
No man laughs.
The spectacle ends cruelly and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in a sad black clothing stands over the bodies of actors and performs Billy Holiday's sad song "Strage Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted through the word.
In hundreds of yards from her, half a hundred viewers are wiped out of the eyes of tears and sweat.
Among the viewers is almost equal to the number of black and white.
One couple arrived from Takea, New York, to watch the show; many live nearby.
They all endured the severe spirit of Georgia almost eight hours while Brooks led them to pilgrims to Malcolm and Dorsey's graves.
Until then, murders remained only history, but now that they are standing in the same place where people were lying, their ghosts seem to be in the air right away.
When the last note of the song is silent, Green invites people to come closer and look at the bodies.
Kids are slonging to their heads, touching the paint of blood, and immediate bodies and whispering each other.
"They are not really dead," a little boy is murmuring, like to remind himself of it.
In a few minutes, Green thanks the spectacles, and it's all over.
The actors throw the ropes out of the neck and wipe out their tears.
Bradshaw's hugging Marbo, a man in a suit who played the chief puppet.
Nick Rascon embraces two other actors, and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the spectacle finally fell on it.
"It's all right," one of the women whispers.
"We know you have a good heart.
You had reasons for that."
Later, the audience will have dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple in Atlanta has a vivid discussion with a black couple that they have just met.
Denise Daplinsky is hardly looking for words to describe what she feels after the spectacle.
"It's hard to listen to these horrible, horrible words and actions... people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"Then I think the linching is still happening," she adds, "only now it's called police shooting."
In another angle, the room was generally accompanied by Tyron Brooks, who remembered his work as a human rights defender.
He said that he had already planned the subsequent year.
"It encouragings us, because it does not only describe the horror of what we have experienced but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't get it out of this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are condemned to repetition."
The Court has punished the Naval for violations in the "Agitation Sabbath "
The Simonian Court of Moscow punished Alexei Navalian by 300,000 rubles for violation of the order of the organization of the event.
The opponent was recognized guilty of committing administrative offence as provided for in paragraph 20.2 of the RF CoAP “Renewed violation of the order of the organization of the auspices”.
Earlier, Judge of the Moscow Simonov Court of Moscow, Hyzir Musacaev, ended up considering the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of the headquarters of the opposition of Alexei Naval, who was responsible for the same article as the Naval.
The wolf was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 rubles.
In that amount, Judge Mussacaev evaluated the dissemination of leaflets on the " agitation sabbath " which the members of Naval had held in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
Following the agitmaterials followed by the Saturday's participants, the police believed that the organizers of the event had deliberately hid its reality - public action (for which the capital authorities needed a prior request for permission).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers, Ivan Ždanov and Alexander Pomazouev, requested the cessation of administrative production in connection with the absence of offence and indicated that the police allowed certain failures in the drafting of the protocol.
Volkov was not detained at the very "Agitation Sabbath " but he had received a agenda to appear at the police office to tell about the event carried out in his active participation.
The same agendas were received by the Naval and another opponent Nikolai Laskin.
In Mordovia, a firing bride and three wedding guests were arrested
The court in Mordavia arrested a local inhabitant who shot four people at the wedding, including the bride.
This was reported in the Republican Office of the Investigation Committee.
The incident took place at the evening of 29 July.
During the fight, a 42-year-old inhabitant of Saranska shot several times in the guests of the rural pond to bath.
Three women and one man were wounded as a result of injury.
The criminal case under article 213, paragraph (a) of article 213, Part 3 of article 30 and paragraphs (a), (e), “i” of article 2 of the UK 105 (the attempt to kill two and more persons perfect in a general way, from the huligan motivation).
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man had opened a shooting because the wedding guests decided to bathe around his water station.
Minenergy will reinforce the requirements for turbine suppliers for electricity stations
The Ministry of Energy will update the rules for providing information to suppliers of critical equipment, in particular the turbines for electricity stations.
When gas turbines, GES turbines, oil supplies and oil gas supplyers are launched, they will be obliged to share data on access to them with Minenergy and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
The Government ' s draft decision was already prepared and held a public discussion.
The new requirements will only affect the “critically important energy equipment” delivered to Russia.
Potential threats are referred to in the document, such as obtaining information and access to Foreign Services, Criminal Elements and Structures, Independent Partners and Hackers.
The European Union extended anti-Russian sanctions due to Siemens
The European Union Press Service on 4 August stated that anti-Russian sanctions had been extended because of the scandal on the supplies of Simens production turbines in Crim.
This was previously reported by "Argumements of the week".
The EU Council's press service stated that sanctions against the RF were extended because of the scandal with the Simens production turbines, which were allegedly transferred to Crime to the circulation of sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe considers all possible complaints and proposals of Member States to extend anti-Russian sanctions.
It was previously reported that the final decision would be taken until the end of the current day, and the decision was adopted, the sanctions for Russia had been extended.
Pierson reduces 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, the British educational group of Pierson's companies announced that it would reduce 3,000 jobs and reduce the preliminary dividend by 72 per cent in connection with the start of a regular restructuring programme aimed at combating their business problems.
These reductions in jobs, which, according to the head of John Fallon, will mostly occur at the end of 2018 and early 2019, will be added to 4,000 workplaces reduced in previous restructuring.
Pierson announced that it plans to reduce the costs of another 300 million ($394 million) in May during the third cost reduction programme to try to recover the business that hit the rapid transition to digital learning methods.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its share in the Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman, said that its forecasts for the year remained unchanged, after it announced that the sales of the basic goods were increased by 1 per cent in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Convoy attack in Cabul: Nato, soldier, died as a result of the death explosion
According to official sources, a terrorist mortal attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Cabul, killed one soldier of NATO and wounded several others.
Five soldiers and translator were injured, as said in the NATO report.
According to uncertain data from local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the city of Karabah.
This explosion was the last of the affected Afghanistan in this month of bloodshed: more than 30 people died on Tuesday as a result of the explosion in the machete in Gerate.
On Monday, a mortal terrorist killed two people near Iraq's embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion occurred on Thursday night, when the joint convoy with the Afghanistan army was attacked by a “transmitted man of the self-explosive device”.
According to the report, all injured are stable and are treated at the US military hospital at the Bagram Airport.
The correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IG) in Carabach is the main source of concern for NATO forces located near Bagram.
UN reported that at the first half of 2017 in Afghanistan, at least 1662 civilian victims and about 20 per cent of them were in the capital.
At the end of July, the terrorist-death explosion on the car was caused by at least 30 people in the area of Shia in Kabul.
Taliban stated that the attack had been produced.
On 31 May, more than 150 people died in the centre of the city — the most serious human victims of the country’s terrorist since the United States army had removed Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence emphasizes the unreliable situation in Afghanistan, while the President of the United States Donald Tramp appreciates whether the United States military forces to assist troops and police in the country should be increased.
According to the correspondents, the terrors in Cabul, which have been in recent weeks, have also created a crisis of public confidence to the Government, its conduct line, and especially to the reputation of President Ashraf Gani.
The Environmental Protection Agency, after judicial proceedings, abolished the decision to defer the adoption of air pollution law
The American Environmental Protection Agency has cancelled its decision to postpone the adoption of the Obama Act, which requires States to limit air polluting emissions a day after 15 states were sued by the Agency for this step.
On Wednesday night, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called ozone-2015 dimensions, emphasizing that this step shows the readiness of the Agency to cooperate with States.
"We believe in dialogue with our partners in states and the response to them," said the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency, in the statement of Scott Pruitt.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to defer ozone dimensions where the existing air pollution is measured in various parts of the country to determine where it should be reduced to comply with strict air cleanness standards for one year until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, most democratic, together with the Federal District of Colombia, claimed that this intention was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Tramp is trying to reverse the wide range of environmental regulations introduced by the former President Barack Obama, within a broader programme aimed at Tramp, to a brilliant economic growth.
However, acts in this direction have caused the opposition of democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on population health.
The Environmental Protection Agency website states that the use of air breathing containing ozone “may be worsening the function of the lungs and strengthening respiratory symptoms”, for example, asthma.
The European Business Association has compromised new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association expressed disagreement with the United States economic sanctions against RF.
The AEB believes that such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
The AEB statement states that business is one of the important links between countries and people, and therefore it cannot be limited to the principles of free trade.
The European Business combines more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls upon the Heads of States and Governments of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would allow business to be separated from policies and to find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and consent.

British actor Robert Hardy died.
The British actor Robert Hardy, who played the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Faja, in the screening of a series of novels on Harry Potter, ended for the 92th year of his life.
The Independent newspaper reported on Thursday.
The death of an actress was told by his relatives.
They said he lived “a huge life by success in the movies, theatre and television in 70 years of career.”
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English city of Cheltnam.
In 1959, at the Royal Shakespeare theatre, he played with Lawrence Olivier in the "Tragedia of Coriolan".
Hardy also remembered the repeated implementation of the roles of Prime Minister Winstone Churchill, including in one of the screenings of Agatha Christy's production on Miss Marple.
In the course of the role of Churchill in Bi-Bi-Si "Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years" (1981), it was awarded by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA).
Robert Hardy also had to play the role of the President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Something was rotten in the Danish State: Prince Henryk, and in fact, Henry Marie Jean Andre, Count de Labord, refused to be buried together with his wife, Queen Margreta.
This year, the chamber has a " gold" wedding, but the agenda of the couple is not preparing for celebrations, but a huge dispute.
His Highness denied the title of the Prince Consort, reconciliating the queen, which never regretted the title of the King Consort.
Henryk lives in France, although he remains the Queen's official spouse.
MID of Russia urged Washington to stop shaking Moscow
In MID Russia, Mike Pens, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans, responded.
The relevant statement of the Foreign Political Authority has been distributed a while ago.
In its commentary, the MID indicated that the United States had increasingly actively used cold-war stamps, inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called upon the American authorities to stop scattering the RF.
As the "Arguments of the Week" wrote earlier, US Vice-President Mike Pens accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Western Balkans and the organization of a failure in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasilius Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing the possibility of a decisive battle
Vasilius Lomačenko and Mikey Garcia, who appear to be intense to take the most exciting boxing match in a weight of up to 147 pounds in the near future, first met on Thursday.
They took separate rooms in the office rooms of the ESPN channel in Los Angeles, while Garcia, an invincible champion in the lightweight of the World Boxing Council, did not pass through the hallway to welcome Lomachenko, the champion of the World Boxing Organization in the second half-weight.
After Garcia's unanimous victory on the former world champion in four weight categories, Erian Bronner on Saturday, both boxers are in five of the best boxers, no matter the weight categories.
Garcia stretched his right hand and said, “How is it, champion?
Good luck to you."
Lomačenko protects his belt in the fight with Miguel Marriagoy on Saturday at seven o'clock at the ESPN channel.
When the boxers posted for the photo, the manager Lomachenko Egis Climas noticed that the potential decisive fight between them would be the first time.
“I used to be in minor weight,” Garcia recalled.
"I have risen up to the category for Bronner [to 140 pounds], but I am not so large.
I'm painted for 140.
I want to go down to half-light.
And he's got to get up to a half-light [to 135 pounds], and then we're going to fight.
That's what the cheerleaders want.
Let's do this to them."
Lomačenko agreed.
"Box needs this fight."
Climas asked whether the fight should be transmitted through the PPV service, as part of the strategy that he was committed to put Lomachenko on his debate at weight of 135 later this year, to appoint the next summer meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 nokauts), which was also interested in fighting with the winner of the fight between Horhe Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the title of the world champion in the easy weight of the Forum Arena on 23 September.
“The fight may be on the PPV, because all the guests asked for it” Garcia said later, expressing the willingness to fight on the channel that would offer the best financial conditions.
"We are the main names.
No other names will cause such interest.
As soon as they are ready...”
Garcia said that Lomachenko considers a “sweet boxer” and may be visiting his Saturday battle.
But Lomachenko didn't immediately suppress Garcia with commendations and said that, in his opinion, the champion in three weights of Riverside seemed "very slow, sorry, Mikey... you asked for a knockout."
Garcia said he was focusing on showing the strength of the strike, and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension of their own battle.
"This fight must take place.
None of the other struggle causes so much interest and conversation.
I am more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for one of the top boxers, and there he is, Mikey.
This will be a great fight."
In several central streets, Moscow will close the weekend movement.
On this weekend, on 5 and 6 August, the movement will be limited to the capital at the Trust Street station from the Nastasian Street to the Triumph Square, as well as to the 1st Trust-Jama Street.

The streets will be closed from midnight to 5 august to 5 a.m. on 7 August in connection with their accommodation.
The motion will also be closed on the Moscow Coast District on the weekend.
There continues the construction of the Charge Park.
Putin ordered the Gen Prosecutor to check Baykal.

" Please verify the Baikal territory for the facts of illicit and environmental harmful activities," said Vladimir Putin at the meeting on environmental development of the region.
Furthermore, the Russian leader asked if the facts of violations were identified.
New results of asylum-seeking tests were published in Sweden
The recent asylum seekers tests in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new medical evaluation method, indicated that more than 80 per cent of the tested were evaluated as persons aged 18 years old, but not all trusted in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
They were developed to make the age assessment more precise in the asylum process, after the Swedish Migrationverket Agency (Migrationsverket) criticised that it was unable to determine the present age of some refugees who claimed that they were minors.
At this point, Migrationverket has sent 6 880 cases for testing, and the judicial medical agency has now published 2,481 tests for the period between March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) of the tested have been evaluated as 18 or older, and in 25 cases, the Judicial Medical Agency has evaluated that the tested “probably human or older”.
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was “likely less than 18”.
The tests are conducted only when human ages cause doubts.
According to Johann Geransson from the Judicial Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent with the results of the past months.
"We do not observe a great difference with statistics in the past months, numbers are quite relevant," he said to the Local portal.
The high proportion of cases for which people were estimated to have reached 18 years did not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers lied about their age.
In May, the Agency published 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases “very likely 18 or more years of age”.
However, after considering 581 published results, the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper discovered that in 243 cases, a person openly stated that 18 was fulfilled this year.
The method of medical evaluation of age in order to make a rentgen of wise teeth and to thumbnails and to analyse them to dentists and rentgenologists has also been criticized in some instances.
One of the skeptics is the endocrineologist from the Caroline Institute, Claude Marcus, whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people to determine whether they have been through sexual maturity before or later.
"I had reasons to think about it, and I don't think that I should use the ways of measurement that are being used right now.
The biological age is thus determined very incorrectly.
If we can't define it with confidence, we should not pretend to do what we can," he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Geranssen, from the Judicial Medicine Agency, expressed the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it is possible to say that the risk of taking a child as a adult is wrong.
We face the greatest risk when a person is 18 soon, in that case he is about 10 per cent."
I'm going to think if I'm going to be president.
During the work trip to Burathia, Vladimir Putin said he was willing to consider whether he would ballot for the President of Russia at the elections in 2018, transmitted Interfax.
This statement has become a response to the request of the villages of the Buryat region.
During the video conference on the elimination of the fire in Buretia and the Irkut area, the interviewer called to Putin, saying, "Vladimir Vladimirovic, we have a request for you: when the next president's elections, we all ask you to ballot again for this post."
"Okay, I'll think, thank you," said the president.
On 28 July, the press secretary of Russia, Dmitri Peskov, commented on some media statements that the pre-electoral headquarters of Vladimir Putina would be head of the President's administration, Anton Wyno.
The sandow called these assumptions "nothing based, hypothetical reasons."
"No headquarters, before the headquarters are established far, before the election campaign," said Peskov.
" As long as this is not worth the agenda," said Peskov.
Governor of Western Virginia said he was moving into another party
Governor of Western Virginia, representative of the Democratic Party, Jim Justis announced on Thursday during the meeting with the President Tramp, that he was moving into another party.
“Do you like it or not, but the democrats have gone away from me” said Governor Justice.
"I say to you today with many prayers and many thoughts... today I tell you, the people of West Virginia: I cannot be no longer helpful to you as Governor-Democrat."
Mything exploded by applause.
“Therefore, I will change my registration to the Republicans tomorrow”, added Justice.
"As a coach, I would tell you that it is time to play differently."
Rather, Tramp promised that an important statement would be made at the Western Virginia meeting.
Tramp won in West Virginia with a 42 per cent cross, and Justice did not support a candidate from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which, according to Forbes, was the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he belongs to coal mines in five states, since he inherited a coal business from his father.
His condition is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the National Committee of the Republican Party made a statement on Thursday night that “The transition of Governor Justice to another party is another strike on the Democratic Party, which is more impeded than working to make our country a big again”.
“Bearing in mind only 15 governors and control of the minimum number of state laws in history, the statement of Governor Justice is just another refusal from a party that has no leaders from the top of the bottom and is unable to find a positive, uniting message,” said the representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Ronna McDaniel, in the statement of CBS News.
Mr. Beautiful found a house thanks to social networks
The Pittsboro (Northern Caroline, United States) built a cat named Mr. Beautiful Weight of more than 14 kilograms after he became famous by the Internet.
This is what Mashable reports.
At the end of June, a photo of the cat was published in the feather's receiving the master 'cause 'they were obviously feeding him before'.
In comments, users pointed out that the expression of animal mortality could become a new memo.
The publication collected more than 3.2 thousand liquors and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed their desire to hire Mr. Beautiful.
As a result, it was given to Angela Frazee (Angel Frazee), who promised to take care of his weight.
In the WNCN radio interview, the American said that she had already had a similar experience: she took a cat home weighing about 10 pounds, and now it weighs about five.
In July, the Reddit users focused on a cat from Australia with unusual long paws.
More than 68,000 views were collected with an animal photograph.
The commentators noted that it could make a career in a model business.
Kou commended Russia ' s " sincere" apologies for the doping scandal
The international athletic expert on light athletic Sebastian Cou commended on Thursday the apology of Russia for the doping scandal, but repeated that it was not the right time to allow the country to participate again in sports competitions.
The Russian representative of the Federation of Light Athletics, Dmitri Puttin, reported at the convention of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations, which took place before the World Championship on Light Athletic, that the elimination of his country from sports competition was fair and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He apologised to “all sportsmen with gold and silver medals stolen in competitions”.
Despite its comments, the International Association of Lightweight Federations voted in favour of the conservation of the withdrawal in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on the found evidence of the use of the doping funded by the State.
"I felt that today's response, today's report was very sincere," President of the International Association of Leisitical Federations of Cou said to the reporters.
“All Council and the Congress enjoyed... that the Russian Federation itself recognized that she had suffered extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the Federation.”
Kou said he was also “conceived” that Russia agreed with the criteria of its recovery.
"I believe that this was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that is not the time to restore Russia in rights," Kou said.
"In the next few months, we have to do everything we can to solve this situation.
Our leading principle was our desire to separate pure sportsmen from the intimate system," he added.
Nine Russian sportsmen, respective to the strict criteria of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations, will participate under the neutral flag in the world championship on light athletic, which will begin on Friday in London.
The Chief of the Special Commission of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements had yet to be met for the restoration of Russia.
As he reported to the reporters in London after the report made at the International Association of Light Athletic Federations, drug tests are still not carried out in sufficient volumes, and removed coaches are still doing their work quietly.
The Court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of the Statement
Detained by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) journalist Vasilij Muravicki was sent to arrest for two months, transmitted by the CAP.
The Internet Officer of the Journal of Lifemira is suspected of a public betrayal by posting its publications on Russian sites and instigating Ukraine ' s territorial integrity.
Russia, however, does not support Ukrainian authorities' measures against the journalist, considering that "warvary policy" against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The patrol ship, Commander of Borsini, entered Libya's territorial waters to stop the influenza of illegal migrants with the IMS of that country.
The decision to start the operation was adopted by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed it with the internationally recognised Government of Libya, which, however, did not control most of the country's territory.
The opposing office and the Libyan parliament based in Tobruk accused Italy of the violation of the sovereignty of Libya.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarchal Haftar, gave his subjects an order to oppose Italian ships.
In Rome, however, said that they did not believe these threats and intend to send another military ship to the Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the negotiations of the Italian Prime Minister Paolo Jentiloni and the chairman of the European Libyan Office, Faiz Saraj.
The authorities of Italy went to the establishment of a marine mission to combat illegal migration after the number of illegals from Libya had been published in July: 95,000 people from the beginning of the year.
The Government stated that migrants ' resources were exhausted.

Two leaders of Ukraine's College for Light Athletic have been removed from participation in the CM
Olga Earthak and Olesia Powh, specialized in a short distance, are excluded from Ukraine's composition for the world championship of 2017 in London.
This is reported on the website of the Federation of Light Athletics (FLAU).
Such a decision was taken by the General Organization in connection with the incitement of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations (IAAF) of disciplinary production in relation to adolescents.
Coach Sergei Basenko is also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
As Sportarena reports, IAAF suspects a sportsman of the use of doping.
The Bronze Prize of Olympiada-2012 and the Peace Champion of Europe-2010 in the estate of 4 to 100 meters, the Earthac winner of the 2012 European Prime Championship in the estate of 4 to 400 meters.
The World Championship of Light Athletics in London will take place from 4 to 13 August.
How the financial football rules will affect Neimar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending from European football clubs will not interfere with the world record of Neimar's transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Pari Saint Germen.
Whatever consequences can be followed by the chain, for the Pare of St. German, the UEFA Governing Body, which controls European football, whose power is to prohibit the teams from taking part in the prestigious championship of the League.
The UEFA's financial rules introduced in 2011 should show that the PPG would eventually have to show that the transfer of Neimar was financed without major losses.
Barcelone paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) only to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Neimar would receive a complaint that would reach tens of millions a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neimar's transfer to France.
The PPG can definitely be delighted to hire Neimar and add it to the galaxy of other stars, if it takes into account the funding of the team by the rich energy of the Katar family.
The clubs have the right to spend large amounts on acquisition of players, but they have to balance them with legal income sources to reach the threshold of rental in their football business.
The FFP introduced Michel Platini after its election by the President of UEFA in 2007.
Former French footballist believed that clubs that entailed in huge debts in their pursuit of success, in fact cheated and risked destruction if banks or owners ceased funding.
In 2011, the FFP stopped focusing on the club debts, and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result, the change in business model, which Roman Abramovic originally used in Chelsea in 2003, was to buy a club with good capacities and then to spend seriously to improve the team and create a world brand, has become a difficult plan.
During this three-year evaluation period of 2018, clubs can be lost at 30 million euros.
And despite the shame that Platini was distracted from the presidential post in 2015, his successor in UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, still determined to keep the excessive waste.
"Of course, the FFP is alive, and we will move forward to the rules," said last week to the Associated Press Agency Andrea Traverso, who controls the FFP in the UEFA.
Although the CPG will pay for the purchase of the Neimar contract at the same time, it can allocate this amount for accountability at the time of his contract.
Neimar signed a five-year treaty, so the transfer value could be shown in the annual accounting as an amount of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years.
During the first wave of the FFP sanctions in 2014, the most severe sanctions were applied to the Abu-Dabi.
The PPG was set up in 60 million euros (concurrently 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros and was recommended to limit the composition of its team in the League of Championships during the season 2014-1015 by 21 players instead of ordinary 25.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to oversuffice its financial inspections by breaking its income from companies associated with the owners of the club.
At least the Katarian company could promote the PPG, but if the amount of funding was estimated to be higher than the standard market assessments, UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legal income.
That's what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the amount of the SGG funding by the Qatar Tourism Office was broken down.
It was reported that a part of Neimar's earnings in the PPG could have been paid by the organizational committee of the World Championship 2022 in Katara.
But PSJ and Qatar-2022 denied that Neimar would be the ambassador of the world champion, and such a manoeuvre could easily be discovered by UEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on the SMEs mean that UEFA would be more careful in monitoring any attempts to circulate the rules.
As reported on Thursday, UEFA did not have preliminary discussions with the CAP on the transfer of Neimar.
They communicated with the Associated Press Agency under the conditions of anonymity, since they were not authorized to discuss the situation of the PPG.
According to the latest issued reporting, more than 10 million euros received in trafficking in EUR 542.4 million in 2015-1016.
The accountability for the last financial year has not yet been published.
The CPG expects Neimar's arrival to be a favourable soil for sponsorship transactions, selling attributes and team shirts.
The club suggests that the traffic will increase by at least 30 per cent due to the rent of a new player.
Undoubtedly angry with the departure of one of the best football players, the Spanish League tried to stop Neimar's transfer, claiming that the PPG would violate the Finance Play.
“This is the obvious case of the financial doping, with the club and the State”, said President of the Spanish newspaper La Liga Javier Tebas, in view of the final owner of the CPG, Qatar.
Arsenal Trainer, Arsen Wanger, whose club belongs to the American Sports Magnat, shares the doubts of the La League on the financing of the club by the State.
"It is all the consequences of the declined participation, and it has completely changed football landscape in the past 15 years," said Wanger on Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the country, perhaps everything.
It is very difficult to observe the financial play because the country may have many ways and many reasons to be presented by such a serious player.
The order and sworn seats shall be determined by the President
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear to the faithfulness of the RF, the President will define such amendments to the second reading in the relevant law had been drafted by the Committee of the Legislative and Housing Committee.
A week ago, the deputies planned directly to determine the order of the vow in the law.
From the solemn oath, children will be released up to 18 years and unable to be released from an advanced text of amendments to the RF Citizenship Act (i.e. " Notes " ), which the Committee will consider before its second reading at its meeting on 11 July.
The idea of sworning in the RF nationality instead of formal signature of documents, President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of meeting with the State spokesman Vičeslav Vladini on 6 June.
The Deputies introduced this idea in the form of amendment to the second reading of the law, which would call on the public excuse in the media or on the Internet (No. 2 p. 205.2 of the RF), as well as for theft of a plane, train or water transport, but only if this act is related to terrorism (No. 4 p. 211 PCF).
According to the draft law, its logic was: by making documents for citizenship, a person is signed under the promise to comply with the Russian legislation - he entered into the way of extremism, he violated the promise.
The Act was introduced in April by the leaders of the Mediterranean fractions of Vladimir Vasilev (United Russia), Gennadius Zuganov (CPRF), Vladimir Žirinovski (LDPR), Sergei Mironov (Just Russia) and speaker of GD Vjačeslav Volodin.
On May 19, the deputies accepted it in the first reading.
Last week, the GD Committee on Hospital and Legislation approved the text of the draft law for second reading, but now it has been reconstructed again.
It now states that the oath order will set up by the President of RF.
The parliamentarians had previously planned to describe the procedure directly in the RF Citizenship Act, pointing out that the ceremony should be held in the solemn situation before the State Herb and the Russian flag in the presence of the representative of IMD.
However, the text of the draft law was not clear where such an event should take place - a list of places where the gerb of RF could be placed by the Federal Constitutional Law.
These include courts, offices of the Heads of State of the Body, Municipal Educations, Judges, Prosecutors, Heads of the Federal Executive Body, etc.
Probably these could be the ZaGSs.
The solemn oath that will receive RF citizenship will be made after the officials check their documents.
But the Russian passport will only be received after the oath is made from the text.
A week ago, the project stated that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that Russia will be sworn since 18 years, not from 14.
A rule was maintained by which the vows would be released by unable or limitedly efficient, as well as those who cannot make, read or sign the vow in their own hands.
Furthermore, the President of the RF has the right to release this procedure and “other persons”,
The updated law also provides a special order for adoption to the Russian citizens of Ukraine, which are considered russian nationals.
They will have to officially renounce Ukrainian citizenship by making a statement to the authorized authority of Ukraine for that purpose.
A noted copy of the statement will need to be transmitted to the Russian officials.
The refusal of foreign nationality, as is now, will not be required if it is provided by an international treaty or if it is not possible "with the undependent reasons".
The corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by the Group of Deputies, including the first vice-speaker of GD Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Poklonska, Paul Krashennikov and Irat Farrahov (all the " Single Russia " ).
I think many of you know that it's not real, it's impossible.
Accordingly, many are expecting a solution to their destiny on RF nationality,” explained the head of the thought Committee on Hospital and Law, Paul Krashennikov (ER).
Furthermore, the text clarifies that restrictions on certain posts for foreigners would not be circulated to those who had writtenly denied the " other" nationality and passed the previous passport in the IMD of Russia, but "with no reasons for it" did not stop considering it a national of another country.
Foreigners are now forbidden to take offices at municipal service, to be taken to work for facilities and organizations whose activities are related to Russia's security.
Also, a person with double nationality or a species of residence of another country cannot be a representative of the State or member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force since 1 September 2017 and that the necessary under-legitimate acts should be prepared.
Nostalgia becomes a nurse in the "Hot American Summer" and "Detective Communities"
The current historical iteration reminds the famous days of characters in the 1980s; about the age of the 90s (excellent Master David Wayne and Michael Schwalter made a comedy with the "State" for MTV," and itself about 2001, before her stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poler and Paul Radd, have moved to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time the elevation of our age with its constant Facebook reminders.
But as a franchise, it seems to be an anachronism.
The "First Day of Camp" was surprisingly good, not only because of the absurd humor (including the original story of the Speaking Bank of Vegetables that H. John Benjamin had heard).
The result doubles the main joke: mid-age actors play sexually concerned children who have just reached their age; it makes it impossible to get back into a joke.
"Decea years later," where adults played adults, they have less deep emotional roots, and its parodity is more irregular and includes reefs from the steady movies of the 1990s, such as the "Ruke of Cowboy".
In one episode, the character gets Apple Powerbook, four-crowd rollers, and a bunch of other things from 1991.
Many of the tales of the story are the same.
The charity of Coop (Showolder), now a writer, has not yet achieved mutuality from Cathy (Margarite Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not quit virginity yet.
And there's a crazy and vile conspiracy in which Ronald Reagan (i.e. Shawolter) is now incited by George Bush Senior (experienced parodia in execution of Michael John Blake).
As always, the best part of the frenchise is derogation from it.
Especially fun to see a young Radd everlastingly singing Matt Dillon's song from the "Soons", whose character, former old man, Andy looks like an old man now.
This franchise could succeed in random intelligence in the spirit of the recursive Seven Up series, until it came to the fact that, I think, it would be its logical end: "Hot American summer: twenty years later," where in the last stage, the whole company would go to the movie at the "Hot American Summer".
The "Detective" compartment in Amazon addresses another type of nostalgia: the memories of cold war from the Americans, the Explosive Blonde, or even the Flash with its images of the East and the West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanako with director Reese Thomas, represents a television: Romanian police drama in the 1980s on two police officers in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and Marksist Lenin.
The main roles of Gregor's life and the idealist of Josef have been performed by Florin Piercik and Corneliu Street, and their dialogues in English, Channing Tatum (he is an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levit.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are several visual jokes (police spend time watching a chess game, like Americans could watch football).
The team of famous votes -- Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Seviña -- allows you to play an interesting " guess the voice".
But the Detective Comrade is so perceived for the propaganda propaganda propaganda - there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask, which often looks like it.
Six long episodes are delayed and funny are not very often.
If it had been made shorter, the "Comrade Detective" could better deal with its satira in the spirit of agitpropa; for example, every time Gregor and Josef come to the US embassy, there are two fat men sitting in the chamburgers in the chamber.
This image tells the imaginary communist that the Western culture is able to make any shape from anything.
The artificial Romanian film writers are not so wrong: we do so even with our recent history, and with them.
The Spartack and Locomotive Football Fund for the Super Cube of Russia will comprise a round of 30 million rubs.
The President of the Russian Football Prime Minister (RFPL) Sergej Predkin reported on the press conference.
According to chapter RFPL, the winner will receive 70 per cent of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that tickets for the match were not nearly left to date.
Spartacus-Locomotive will take place on Friday, 14 July, at 21:30.
As TACS notes, Spartacus is an active RF champion, and Locomotive is the owner of the country's Cube.
Two young Ufimians cleaned up the furniture price of 200,000 rubles
A 37-year-old Ufimi, who had a furniture company, came to the police.
The man stated that it was a robbery of expensive instruments, which caused serious damage to his production.
The stealing of the thief was a total of nearly 200 000 rubles: two quarrel apparatus, perforator, hydraulic, swan.
The guards of the order came to search for criminals and soon came to the residents of the Bashcortostan Area, friends of 23 and 24 years.
According to the press service of the IMD republic, the companions entered the territory of the enterprise, broke the front door and delivered tools.
Right after that, the boys sold the stealed technique of the first busy car service.
Theft has already been raised against them, and the law enforcement officers have been able to return to the legitimate owner only part of the abducted instruments.
State Department commented on the words of Medvedev on RF and United States relations
The United States and Russia should be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of the State of Heather Nauert in response to the words of Prime Minister of RF Dmitri Medvedev on the relations of two States.
Previously, the russian Government head stated that, taking new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and announced a full trade war.
In commenting on these words, Nauert recognized that the Russian-American relations were at a " low level", but noted that it was necessary to seek "related areas for interaction".
"Look at the reconciliation in Southwest of Syria, which has been held for almost a month."
"It is an example of good cooperation in the United States and Russia," states the RIA News diplomat.
However, the representative of the Foreign Political Office refused to comment on the statement by the Russian Prime Minister that sanctions were equal to trade war.
The new sanctions Act on Russia, Iran and CNDR, the President of the United States, Donald Tramp, signed in the past Wednesday.
He recognized that the document was unsuccessful and contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior grown roses from ametics and Quartz

Tramp found a deteriorating relationship with Russia
The President of the United States, Donald Tramp, was criticized by members of the Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have resulted in a deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia have been incredibly low and dangerous.
"You can thank the congress, the same people can't even give us medicine," said the President at Twitter.
Before Donald Tramp signed the law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and CNDR.
In particular, they will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House circulated the president ' s statement that the law would not allow the United States to conclude profitable transactions and further bring closer RF, China and North Korea.
Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
The entrepreneur from Belarus Victor Prokopenia revoked a request from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBB) to buy the Sberbank daughters.
The businessman's decision explained the RBC's intention to “concentrate on other our planned investments and projects that we are working on”.
Mr. Prokopena said that such a step would be “better investment in time” despite the investment attraction of Sberbank's daughter's purchase.
Mr. Prokopenia became the principal claimant to buy the Russian bank in Ukraine after the application of the NorvikBank Gregory Gusselnikov and the Belorusian company Saida Gucerieva was rejected in July.
The Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after the President of the country, Peter Poрошenko, in March introduced sanctions on their daughter structures.
One of such financial organizations, in addition to the WTB and the External Bank, became Sberbank.
Novak named the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
In the Ministry of Energy, RF referred to the cause of the blackout in Crime.
Explanations on what happened were made by the head of the Department of Alexander Novak.
He said that the peninsula had remained unused because of the road traffic incident in the territory of the Krahnodar.
The truck connected to the DTP was electro-transmission lines, which resulted in the deactivation of Cuban and related Crimean networks.
Failures in the electricity of large Crimean cities have been fixed last week.
Professionals have removed disorders for a few hours.
It was initially reported that the cause of the blackcaute could have been an anomaly fever.
The Bank of England will maintain interest rates at 0.25 per cent
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that the interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have made rumors about possible increases.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain unhealthy and left interest rates without changes in the rising pressure on family income.
The Committee's Specialists for Monetary Credit Policy (MPC) voted with 6 to 2 for saving the rate of 0.25 per cent, with less members of the Committee expressed that the rate was increased, because the weak economic growth had reduced the support of increases.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts to 1.7 per cent increase in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018 and warned that family income pressure would continue, while the autumn inflation was still expected to be up to about 3 per cent.
However, the Bank warned that the increase in rates in the next few years would be necessary to control the inflation caused by brexite, and said that the loan costs would probably have to be raised stronger than expected in the financial markets.
Members of the Committee also voted to renounce the part of the universal complex of economic development measures launched a year ago as a result of the brexite.
Starting from the next February, the bank will close the urgent financing plan that it would provide cheap loans to banks, although he reported that it is now in the framework of this plan to provide another 15 billion pounds, up to 115 billion pounds.
In the decision on the rates, the Bank said: “In accordance with the main MPC forecasts, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) remains slow, while the pressure on real income of families continues to affect consumption.”
On the question of the rates, he repeated that a “behaviour of financial policies” would be needed in order to stop inflation.
The markets are now predicting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that all improvements would be “progressive” and “limited”.
The bank's forecasts for the increase in this and the next year are below the projections made in May, which were 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank left its projection at 1.8 per cent in 2018.
Following the news, the sterling fell in relation to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was taken after the recent uncomfortable growth rates were weakened; GDP then increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter to 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the bank representative, the growth is estimated to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase a little at the end of the year.
The latest inflation bank report gave a few reasons for the joy of households affected by high inflation and slight increases in salary: the pressure will be strengthened before the decline.
The Bank added that the financial policy “can't prevent” declined in earnings in the next few years, but expects that the salary “significant” will be recovered by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also intensified to increase as a result of increasing demand for British goods due to a low rate of pound, which compensates for part of the lower consumer costs.
The decision was taken a year after the rates were reduced to 0.25 per cent last August after the shocking results of the European Union's exit referendum.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully influence prices and economies.
Before the bank made its last decision on rates, the noise had increased around the estimated increase in the rates, since the inflation increased its pressure on and thus experiencing strong domestic pressure: three experts requested to increase rates to 0.5 per cent in July.
Last month, the inflation fell to 2.6 per cent of 2.9 per cent in July, although, according to the bank, the fall was expected and in the coming months was reimbursed.
According to the bank, a higher rate compared to the 2 per cent planned is the result of a low pound rate.
Andrew Montlake, director of the Coreco Company ' s hypothetical brokers, said: "If the recent drop of coal courses are taken into account, the mortgage market would seem to be even more competitive, as creditors demand business opportunities and count on a good end of the year.
The market seems particularly favourable for those approaching the conclusion of their existing treaties, as refinance of credits, often with the absence of the commission and with a low rate, becomes popular as ever.”
The State Health Service will describe a dispute against the HIV 10,000 people
From September, patients will receive access to a “revolutionary” HIV prevention medicine after battle in the High Court on the financing of the medicine from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that the pre-expository prevention of HIV (PEP), a tablet taken before sex, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection in persons in the risk group, on average by 86 per cent, would now be provided by health services during the initial three-year testing period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to finance the test after the Court of Appeal supported the decision of the High Court last year, which claimed that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay PREP, despite its statements that it had to be financed by local authorities.
This step, announced on Thursday, was referred to as “the most important innovation” by the President of the National Health Service of England Simon Stevens, and the National Authority for the Dissemination of AIDS (NAT) called it a “return moment”.
Before the full launch of the programme throughout England by April 2018, Veneral Dispansers in London, Bryton, Manchester, Liverpoole and Cheffield will start registering people, and more dispensers will join the programme in October.
Pre-expository prevention (PREP) is a course of HIV medicinal products taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PREP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infections among people in the risk group.
At the acceptance of PREP before sex in human organism, there is sufficient number of certain medicines to prevent HIV infections.
Such medicinal products can be administered daily or not more than two hours before sex.
Patients with the right to obtain the medicine include homosexual and bisexual men, transgenders and people whose HIV partners are positive and are not successfully treated.
Dispensers will take the appropriate participants who agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgenders and persons whose partners are not known whether their HIV status is stopped by antiretroviral therapy.
People who live and who are accompanied by a general practice in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venerological dispenser who participates in the programme.
The programme would cost 10 million pounds, and the National Health Service of England signed a treaty with the product after the international tender.
The study was built in this way to evaluate all the possibilities of the PREP on the collection of clinical data on who is the targeted audience of the medicinal product, the acquisition and use of it largely.
“This important innovation should complement and strengthen widespread and more successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another weight in over three decades of success in the fight against one of the largest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, President of NAT (National Administration for AIDS Proliferation) said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PREP, if it is literally aimed at people who need help and risky, allows the situation to change the situation of the HIV epidemic in England.
From September, people who are in the HIV risk group, thanks to this study conducted in England on the National Health Service, will receive access to a new opening fund that can be managed by the person without discussing this with the partner, which will improve many lives.
We warmly welcome this news."
Ian Green, President of the Terrenz Higgins Foundation, said: “Now we need to make sure that the test turns quickly across the country and that none of the HIV risk groups are forgotten.
Now that we are provided with the PREP experimental product, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people in the HIV risk zone.”
Shadow Minister Shadow Health, Sharon Hodgeson, said: “We are very welcome to the start of the PREP test, it has been very late for months of delays and provocations by the Government.”
The data show how revolutionary this medicinal product can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and cease transmission of this year infection.
This test will bring us closer to the full understanding of the privileges of the PREP.
It is now important that the test is as soon as possible across the country to protect the people in the HIV risk group and move us further towards the cessation of the spread of HIV in society.
The World Congress of Tatar adopted a resolution on the support of the Tatarstan and Russia treaty
The Sixth Meeting of the World Congress of Tatar (WCT) adopted a resolution which noted the importance of preserving the President ' s position in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the “recommended form of the organization of the higher government in the Republic and expressing national interests of the entire Tatar people”.
The meeting also emphasized the importance of the Treaty on the Distribution of Authorities between Russia and Tatarstan in the resolution.
According to the document, he "have played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and public-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole".
Recall that the Treaty between Moscow and Kazanya has been concluded for 10 years since 24 July 2007.
On 11 July, the Deputies of Gossovet Tatarstan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and maintain the title of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only subject of the Federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only person whose position is called "President".
There were difficulties in Russia with international drivership rights
GIDD units have a deficit of international driver's certificates (IU).
In order to obtain such rights, it has to be awaiting a few weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers who wish to leave abroad on their car or to take it there.
It should be noted that the situation with international driver certificates remains contrary.
The IU was introduced to make the foreign police easier to understand what the national certificate says, since it explains the information in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Road Convention, but in countries ratified by the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are also recognized.
However, it depends on the specific police or procurement offices: some require the IMU and some of them have sufficient national rights.
In order to ensure, the drivers of international rights are still receiving, but it should be taken into account that in non-ratified countries (e.g. US, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities are not entitled to recognise national rights or ICUs.
There is now a problem with the forms almost in all GIDD units, reports Commersante, conducting a study in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow, the UGIBD units aren't exclusive, they've been missing for four months.
It could be logged in on the public website, but the turn was already in mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, the IMU cannot be obtained "for technical reasons" without being detailed, in the Samaritan area, it is honestly said that there are no forms, the same situation is in other cities.
Many Moscows have already encountered a problem, and the social networks are increasingly reported as follows:
Irina Burmistrova: " Guess why cannot international rights be obtained in Moscow?"
That's right, because all the GIDD offices have ended up.
Elena Podkolzina: "The question of the people known!"
International rights must be obtained very urgently.
In Moscow, it's still far ahead, and the talons are not even released in the place (button is there, but it can't give it).
It's kind of a portal of the servant showing that the time of free to shit is in the Speed.
Has anyone tried to get in another city?
Does it work?
As explained in the IMD, the requirements for international driver's certificates have changed, so the Gosavois Inspection Division is delivered to new banks.
The deficit may, indeed, be illustrated, which changes have not been reported before.
Blanki purchases the Centre for Traffic Safety (BDD) and then puts them in the GIDD units.
In recent years, all contracts were made with AO "Goznak " : nearly 200 thousand ICBs were produced in 2014-2015, 15,000 banks were purchased in 2016, 90, but the latest contract was concluded on 18 July with the OO "First Printing Court" for 70,000.
There is a version that the CSN simply failed to make a tender in time, which causes deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of banks: because of the crisis, many have started to ride themselves, not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries, China, Thailand, and so on.
What rights are accepted there, uncertain to the end, so people are also being insured, so there has been an important demand for international " scores".
It has recently been known that professional drivers will have to conduct a test to confirm their qualifications.
Mintrance made such a proposal.
The International Driver Certificate (IU) of the new model has been operated since 31 May 2011.
Ukraine's Minister for Justice refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine, Paul Petrenko, stated that he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Krim.
On Friday, on 4 August, he said, "The Appreciator" in the interview.
No respectable international company would even put a talk or a hack there because it would risk losing its business in the EU, the United States, Japan, in countries who joined Russian sanctions against Crime.
"It is, in my deepest conviction, no prospects are actually available," said Petrenko.
He added that Russia was unable to implement the large infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot build smaller objects.
I know that after the Sochi Olympics, all the stadiums have already been destroyed.
“Therefore, I believe that the best instrument in this situation is the sanctions against companies that have proved to be so low-seemed to join the project,” the official noted.
On July 31, the constructioners completed the ark of the Crimean Bridge.
The carchen shore is completed with a total arch of the Crimean Bridge: its accommodation is closed at 45 meters from the design.
"The bridge builders were at the same time preparing for the installation of a railway ark at the pharmaceuticals," said the project information center.
In April, head of Mintransa, Maxim Sokolov, informed the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, that the establishment of the facility was in advance of the schedule.
The Crime bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and the Krasnodar Land.
In Spain, a official who has not been working for 10 years has been fired
What patience should the head of the Spanish official, Carlese Resio, have (or absolute indifference to the public service) have?
Permanent walk has been extended for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Resio was still fired.
But not his direct boss.
What is not happening in the bureaucratic world.
The inhabitants seem to have been used to all the mess of the people.
Nevertheless, the officials are constantly surprised by those whose taxes they live well.
This time, the "sensation" regretted Spain.
There, a Valencia archive worker Karles Resio managed to stay out of work for ten years.
He received a regular complaint.
A total of 50,000 euros per year.
And then Mr. Resio's "beautiful times" is over.
He was fired by the decision of the Valencia legislative Assembly.
The investigation revealed that a angry walker came to the office at 7:00 a.m. every morning to mark the electronic system.
And he went home right away.
Once again, he appeared at work at 4:00 to remark that he left.
And so, ten years.
It was also known that all the time of the walker was devoted to the drawing of comics at home.
The Deputy of the Valencia legislative Assembly now thinks how to punish Mr. Resio's direct Chief, who could not know how to " work actively" in his workplace.
Judges are invited to protect from the Chairpersons
The Chairman's Human Rights Council (HPC) on the commission of Vladimir Putina developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judicial branch.
The CPC suggests that the powers of the chairpersons of the courts be limited and that they should be elected.
For vessels of the Appeal and Casational Instances, the HPC wishes to introduce special districts that will not be bound to the administrative and territorial share in the RF.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals under the Presidential assignment.
The SME has completed the drafting of proposals to strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by Vladimir Putin on 3 January 2017, which the President had given after meeting with the members of the Council.
The meeting with the members of the Council on 8 December 2016 discussed, including individual cases of judicial proceedings, as well as issues of public control in the areas of detention of citizens (see " A " of 9 December).
The outcome of the work was 25 proposals relating to both the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors and the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremleu human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the chairpersons of the courts to increase independence of the other judges.
If the judge's candidate has successfully contested and has received support from the judicial community, the Chairman of the Court of Justice, in the opinion of the APP, should submit it to the appointment without the right to deny the law now.
It is also proposed that the Chairperson be deprived of the right to allocate cases to the judges.
To do so, experts may allow a specially written computer programme.
Furthermore, the SMEs believe that the Chairman is not entitled to “determinate the results of the qualifications of the judge, to initiate his involvement in disciplinary responsibility, to decide to establish additional material payments”.
The Presidential Council, however, considers it necessary to “elect the Chairpersons of the Courts themselves” and “to give them the powers for a relatively non-continued period with mandatory rotation”.
The President of the Supreme Court of Justice of the RF is now appointed by the President of the Supreme Court of Justice for six years.
In order to prevent the judges from pressure from regional administrations, the CPC suggests that the courts of general jurisdiction renew appeals and cassation.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and territorial division of RF.
The SMEs say that “need to ensure that individual appeals and cassation vessels are organized, not at the level of district judiciary in the PF subjects, but in the judicial districts”.
Experts are based on arbitral practices.
There are “judicial districts”, which do not match the administrative division in the RF, but which guarantees great independence from regional officials who are difficult to use the “phone law”.
The World Judges of the CAP suggests that national judiciary be strengthened in order to consider certain " civil and administrative categories " .
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the recovery of work, the protection of honor and dignity, the deprivation of driver rights, etc.
"It's only our proposals," explained the "Y" member of the CPC, the Constitutional Court of Retirement of Tamara Morstakov.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate was not only related to the SMEs but also to the Supreme Court (WC), which has not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time for the WP (mediately, gender prosecutors and a human rights authority in the RF).
To report to Vladimir Putin on the effectiveness of the independence of justice in the RF, the President of the WC Viceslav Leбедev should be held by 1 September.
Living high life: semi-fall and fancy designers have turned this small apartment into a spacious apartment in Earls Court.
Joan Lee, a former real estate banker, moved from a space house to the Nightsbridge apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a beautiful type house in the way of Queen Anne, and the new design says that Joan did not gather her things and move again.
“ I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge on a much larger square, ” says Joan.
"I've been looking for something comparable for my money.
They showed me this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered a price on the same day."
Since the first review, the 1,000 square feet flat has completed its reconstruction.
In the beginning, it was an apartment with a complicated planning bedroom -- to get into the bedroom, it had to go through the kitchen -- and Joanna wanted to add spaces to store things and half floors to make the benefits of the generous ceiling.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
It was my requirements," she said.
To this end, she hired Erphana Azadi from the Notting Hill architecture and designer studio, Duck & Shed, to use roofs at 12.5 feet high and to create a housing, which would not only be a successful project but would be worth Joan for life.
The ceiling was insufficient to establish two rooms above each other, so the architectural task was to create a semi-stairs where it could be fully grown.
Erphane had to think creatively to deal with the briefing.
“The work with steel structures is very complex” he explains.
"We had to place the rooms so that they were above each other, and we had to not be screwed.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but to avoid designs so that they were at the right height and allowed to use spaces from above and from the bottom."
This decision allowed Erphane to establish two full-dimensional rooms above each other in a separate space -- and much more interesting.
From the mid-fall, the retrouvius candidate window is opened at a beautiful bedroom below.
The mirror furniture with a golden seat, silver accents and serge Muya's lighting tools give the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding vision, space and light.
The short corridor is decorated with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror defense panel looks like a window in the other room.
The mirror closets at the entrance serve to store Joan's whole vessel.
In order to create a luxury space, the beauty of the living room can block the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new in the kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's moving up the door like in the garage.
“The engineering art has been involved here”, says Erfan of the armed steel of the wooden fiber door.
"She's equipped with the void, so when you push the door up, it's very easy to slip."
With reasonable use of space and storage space, Joan received additional 16 square metres, additional bedroom and improved planning.
"In the end, the area of gender is exactly what you will sell, that is, what your real estate is assessed," says Erfan.
“Grubly speaking, the real estate trade agent will enter and make calculations on the basis of the gender area.”
Here they have been able to increase the area of gender by using quality materials that give the space the shadows of luxury.
"The materials are what we touch, so they help to create emotional connection with the house," says Erfan.
“No one falls in love with an electric wire in the walls.
It is important, but does not affect the strings of our hearts."
This is a testimony that, in view of good design and increased metropolitan, the apartment can become something incredibly amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.

The relevant decision was published on the Government ' s website.
According to the document, the Commission will be the main task of developing and correcting strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policies.
The Commission will also develop projects of a cultural policy strategy, clarify the tasks and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The Chief Commission was appointed Vice-President of the Government of RF.
The composition of the Commission will be approved separately.
The Prime Minister of RF Dmitri Medvedev adopted a plan for the implementation of the State Cultural Policy Strategy until 2030.

Inflation in G20 countries decreased to eight-year minimum
The increase in consumer prices in the G20 countries has declined to the minimum in the last eight years, reports the Wall Street Journal with reference to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD, inflation rates in June 2016 were 2 per cent lower than in October 2009, when price growth index was 1.7 per cent.
Rather, Rosstat reported a decrease in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1 per cent.
Thus, the Department established the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia, according to Minfin, is 4.1 per cent.
Mineeconomics, however, believed that the target was already achieved - by the version of the agency, the indicator was 4 per cent.
Putin warned against the illicit cutting of bajkal taiga
The Russian leader Vladimir Putin, during the meeting on environmental development of the natural bajcal territory, warned against illegal destruction of forests.
During the activities, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergei Donsky, noted that the draft legislation had been prepared earlier.
It permits the cutting of the forest during the elimination of fires, and the Government plans to accept it in the autumn.
In turn, the President stated that the project should be monitored so that the cutting process "do not turn out all in order."
Donsky noted that the bill provided for control by the ICS and supervisory agencies.
Media: Fighters from the command are dealing with Donbass' colleagues
There is regular telephone links on the line of armed resistance in Donbass.
The fighters of counterparts constantly communicate with each other on mobile phones, and they don't know about this in the headquarters.
Fighters and Donbass' colleagues have made mobile phones secretly from their high command.
This is reported on 4 August, Page.ua, with reference to the military operation participants in Donbass.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units are well aware of the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them on the phone daily.
Communication is not at all: Commanders are trying to reach some "tactical arrangements".
Partially, such conversations resulted in a reconciliation at a certain front area.
The journalists have been aware of the occasions when congratulations on the birthday of a officer was received from his formal enemy because of the front line.
Fighters and DDRs and LNRs are sitting on a diversion line from the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a fight operation against Donbass.
MID disturbed the blocking of UNB ' s statements on attacks against the embassy of RF
The Russian Foreign Political Department is disturbed by actions of individual Western diplomatic representatives blocking UN statements in the press condemning the terrorist attacks of the embassy of RF in Syria.
The Russian MID reported this.
The Department recalled that the territory of the Russian embassy in Damascus on 2 August third time per month was undermined by the terrorist groups of Heyat Tahrir Ash-Sham (ex Jabhat an Nusra), prohibited in RF) and the File Ar Rahman.
Recognizing that the international community is unanimously qualified as a terrorist organization and the UNS resolutions call upon to counter this structure, the MID RF noted that " it would seem to be understandable that the Nusra terrorism should meet a universal unconditional and decisive conviction, and that there should be no bisumption in the assessments against diplomatic missions " .
However, as emphasized in the Division, “the third time in the month, the United States diplomatic representatives, Britain, France and Ukraine in the Security Council of the United Nations, alternately, varieting the tone of objections, covering the evidence of lack of allegedly necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard summary draft statement of the Security Council for press condemning terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital”.
The reluctance to demonstrate diplomatic solidarity with us should remain on the conscience of these delegations.
" The most disturbing fact that the inability of the Security Council to condemn terrorist acts promotes new provocations and terrorism, allows them to feel impunity," said the MID and added that "what they would not like to be convinced that someone in the Security Council was with them."
Vladimir Putin spoke for the limitation of the number of extra-plan business checks
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, during the Investment Project Meeting in the Far East, stated that the number of extra-plans checks of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30 per cent of the number of plans and said that the time of inspections should be limited by ten days.
“External verifications are generally carried out without appropriate consent with the prosecutor; only 2-3 per cent agrees with the prosecutor, all the rest goes alone”, quoted the TASS President.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be prohibited from extracting servers and hard drives on businesses.
Furthermore, the President believes that business associations should have the right to protect the interests of their members in the court.
"I hope that this will make some positive consideration of business activities or infringement of the entrepreneurship law," said the head of the State.
As the " E" reported, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs increases due to the action of the Moratorium for Planning Inspections.
In May, the business ombudsman, at the President of Russia, Boris Titova, was conducted a survey, resulting in the fact that the substitution of the planned checks by extra-plans (the number of them had increased from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), the prosecutors (16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), the receivable (7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), as well as the civilian statements (15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).
Details on business checks in the "U" "to the small business went on the other hand."
Brothers fight for the real empire of over $500 million
Two brothers have been warned for one of the largest empires in Victoria's state of real estate trade of over $500 million -- forty years after their Italian ancestors founded a dynasty.
The former director of the Carlton football club and the builder Colin de Lutis lives in the Turkish palace through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a suit against him to the Supreme Court for the separation of property and assets.
Paul wished to leave the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court had a strong dispute on the conditions of divorce.
Together with their mother, Anna brothers owned 87 facilities worth more than a half billion dollars purchased since their family bought a Smith Street store in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family founded the Westco Jeans, which grew up in a network of 160 trade points.
It was sold in 1999 for 85 million dollars.
Money was incorporated in real estate, and the family list of De Lutis included today office buildings, building stations in Brunswick and Sorrento, gold coast apartments and Mount Buller and suburb trading centres.
In agreement with the deceased father of Colin, Paul described as “the main motion force and the dominant personality of the family of De Lutis”, he owns approximately two thirds of the company's assets, and Paul is about one third.
According to the court, this means that the property of Colin is 316 million, and Paul is 176 million.
The division of property and money became a condemnation stone for Paul.
"The section proposed by Cole gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first statements in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failures in reconciliation, the first hearing in the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business - from which, in Paul’s opinion, Colin excluded him.
Colin claims that this is not true, but he accuses Paul of incompetent management of certain objects.
In the testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the process, he said he was hoping to solve the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider the family a high priority," he wrote.
The judicial costs are growing as a snow com: hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mails and reports of companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer; both parties have attracted the most famous lawyers, including the royal lawyer Allan Meyers and the best strikes.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Louisi were immigrants from Italy; since the end of the 1950s they had been running breast bars and gastronomies, and in early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a shop in Collinwood, where Collin opened the first family jeans shop.
Colin said he started Westco when he was "in the last school class and Paul was a boy (approximately 10 years) then."
Anna De Lutis said that they were with Louisi, who died in 2012, hoping to give their possessions to their sons without conflict.
"Luigi often told me that he didn't want the brothers to deal with in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of a group of De Lutis companies; Colina says that Mark received 10 million when he left the business and Luke 26 million.
Paul, Luke and Mark said that they were "disappropriate from the financial conditions of their office".
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the Board of Directors of the AFL Club and, according to the biography published in 2015, Eddie McGira, the best friend of the television.
Ferfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
The only answer was Colin, a text message that said that since the case was not yet considered in the court, "I have no truth to say."
"I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to file a complaint against me and whisper the name of our family," he wrote.
In mid - 2016, Colin wrote in his statements that he tried to meet his brother’s requirements.
"Our father would not like to see Paul and I argue in court," he said, "and he still hopes to solve the conflict."
On Friday, this hope must have dissolved.
"The decision on our case will soon be brought by the court," wrote Colin.
The new chapter of the Tramp apparatus plans to limit the accession of information to the President.
Others tried to do so and suffered defeat.
Maybe John F. Kelly's gonna do it.
In that case, he'll be the first.
“Politico” reports that the new Chief of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to the President Tramp, including the media news, hoping to keep the boss in a more calm state.
That's what reporter Josh Douzi reports.
" At the meeting held by the new head of the White House, John F. Kelly, with the leadership of the equipment on his first working day, he marked the main problem in the White House with President Donald Trampe, which he hopes to decide: bad channels of accession of information to the President."
Kelly told staff that information should be passed through it -- in paper or in briefings -- because the president would decide better if he received the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is absolutely true, but others have already failed trying to reconcile Tramp by tracking his access to information.
President Tramp's relationship with television has been a few decades ago, and now that he is in the White House, his habit of watching television is still strong.
"When Tramp, as a candidate, was disturbed by the unfair lighting of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he had received a fair light in the publications that could have been reconciled," said Sam Nanberg, former electoral advisor in February.
Tara Palmery then wrote to Politics that “the six former members of the electoral headquarters, to keep Tramp's habit to write to Twitter, had to be monitored that there was a constant stream of praise in the coming information.”
Okay.
But the idea that Tramp's habit to write on Twitter once was under control, is just funny.
Maybe these members of the electoral headquarters know something we don't know, for example, that if they weren't, the Twitters of Tramp would be even more provocative.
We may never know about Tweets that Tramp has not published.
If his staff had protected him from trouble at least several times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has ever been able to keep Tramp from pouring butter into fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into competitive fractions, people are constantly trying to promote their agenda, providing the Tramp material reliable or not, which reaffirms their views.
“Politico” -- just to that story -- wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to keep the president with doubts.
Here is one example described by the reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"The current and former Tramp staff say that Tramp can react very rapidly to negative press reports, especially with dangerous information flows, and will not be calmed until he finds who was behind them.
This happened at the end of February, when someone posted the president's printing of the article with GotNews.com, Charles K. Johnson's Internet Provoker website, where the deputy chairman of the Chairperson, Cathy Walsh, was accused of her "a number of escapes" in the White House.
Doesn't matter that Johnson was permanently banned in Twitter for aggressive conduct, that he did not present specific facts or that he had initiated false accusations in the past and then rejected them.
Tramp read the article and began to ask staff on Wales."
Goldmacher adds that then the head of the Raines Pribus apparatus and the Secretary of Rob Porter ' s apparatus ' tried to build a system to manage the flow of papers that Tramp receives and document them. "
How did that work?
Three months later, Kelly's trying to do the same thing.
Perhaps it will be more effective manager than Pribus, but Tramp is still impulsive and his assistants continue to fight each other for the influence.
These constant factors make Kelly a challenge very difficult.
The Tumen Prosecutor is fighting HIV Dissident
The prosecutor contested the decision of the Calining Raisud of Tumeni, which ceased the criminal case against the local resident who had lost a minor daughter from the HIV.
As a result, the child was killed because the mother was HIV-discident and had refused treatment.
However, the court freed her from responsibility for reconciliation with the injured father.
The Prosecutor believes that the crime cannot be left impunity so as to prevent precedents for other HIV dissidents.
The case with Tumenian inhabitant was excited at 1st, p. 109 of the RFC (provocation of death of unwavery) in April, after her three-year-old daughter died from HIV infection of 4V.
According to the prosecutor, the mother itself is HIV-infected.
"The woman was not treated alone and rejected the treatment of her daughter, considering that there is no HIV infection," explained the Tumen Prosecutor.
The criminal case entered the Calining Raj of Tumeni, which decided to terminate it on 25 July.
A request was made by the father of the dead girl, explaining that "forgiving his wife, she has no claims, she has ruined harm and brought apology."
The prosecutor disagreed with the decision of the court and appealed, demanding abolition of the order to terminate the case and send it to a new review.
The girl died, and the crime caused is impossible.
A HIV-infected mother, in contrast with the doctor ' s recommendations, has rejected the survey and treatment of the baby from dangerous infection," the prosecutor's press service reported.
According to the supervisory authority, it should be punished, otherwise other HIV dissidents will follow her example.
As said in the Tumenian AIDS Centre, there are now about 12 children in Tumen, who have HIV, who do not receive medical assistance because of parental refusal.
“It has already improved -- half of the parents who have been категорically refused to treat children with HIV during the year of the work of the special group -- have changed their views -- allowed diagnostic, taking medicinal products," said the press secretary of the Centre for AIDS, Elena Loseva.
She said that the legislative way to affect parents was not possible, and not all HIV-infected children were able to be detected as mothers prevent them from surveying, hiding, fleeing with children from hospitals.
What is the risk of HIV dissidents?
At the end of last year, Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first study of so-called HIV dissident movement in Russia.
HIV dissidents call people who deny HIV and refuse to take medicines.
Medicines and activists of AIDS-service NCO call these views anti-medicinal and see serious threats in their dissemination.
The horrible photo session, which ended by the tragedy, took place on Thursday, 3 August, at the Greek Railway Station in Hmelica.
The fun company of drunk young people was walking over the railways, where a cargo train was standing.
One of the friends had an idea to make an effective self on the roof of the vagon, reported FACTAM in the police communications sector in the Hmelica area.
The guy started coming down from the train bridge, but because of his intelligence, he was stuck behind the line of electricity and right now got a struggle.
Fortunately, this case was known by the dispatchman who immediately called the emergency.
Before the injured doctors arrived, they were moved to a safe place and then hospitalized to the Hospital Hospital District Hospital.
Men have diagnosed the burning of the towels of 1-2 degrees.
His condition is now estimated to be stable.
Legal guards recall that recently the highest popularity has been gained by extreme selfs on the roofs of multi-levels, bridges on the road.
The police call on people to be careful and not to allow such photo sessions, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists allowed oceans to exist in ancient Vienna
There could be oceans in ancient Venus.
The French scientists were assuming that.
Specialists created a computer model that demonstrated the water education process on the surface of the planets, according to Science News.
It turns out that at the beginning of its history, oceans, with 10 per cent more water than now on Earth, were created in Venus.
Previously, "Arguments of the week" said that, according to the scientists ' hypothesis, the ocean could exist on Mars 4 billion years ago.
Foreign experts during their studies concluded that the water facility was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.

The Gypsies have overcome the roof and returned to the street of millions.
Some of the most rich homeowners of Western Millend again conflict with the cruel Gypsies who have overcome the municipal authorities of the Rows to reopen the field next to their homes.
The Gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering with the rich Solihall Street, which received a joking name “Millioners Street”.
And when they brought the horses and the infants and a number of houses on the wheels, they returned after they were expelled as far as they were in May, and they did not interfere with the rows of the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a breakdown in defence facilities and resisted its vehicles through the station which was left unbound to leave a place for the road.
The insulted inhabitants attacked the Solihall municipality, saying that it was “incapable to solve this problem”.
An anonymous local inhabitant reported: “They arrived here on Monday night, after they were expelled from Bentley Hit, where they threw stones into the past.”
The municipality should be embarrassed and forced to act because they are completely unable to solve the problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were expelled, and then they came back.
Last night even more Gypsies arrived, and today maybe even more.
"The Birmingham Municipality knows how to solve the problem, they receive long-term judicial orders to protect their parks," she added.
I live on the Streetbrook Road, and I don't like to keep paying municipal tax, and the municipality can't even end it."
One local inhabitant who wished to remain anonymous said: “This is funny, we just saw these Gypsies leave the last time, and here, please, this attack continues.”
This time, they became more, and we even saw the horse falling on the lounge."
The representative of the Solihall Municipality stated: “We know about the illegal camp on the ground near the Streetbrook Road and we cooperate with the Solihall police; we are taking the necessary legal action so as soon as possible to expel them.”
In order to help us gather evidence, it is very important that as many locals can report any anti-social or criminal conduct to the police on the phone 101.
This allows us to draw up the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crime shares the champagne wine factory "New Light"
The GDP of the Republic of Crime ' s Champagne Wine Facility ' s New Light ' , is determined to act, converting to OAO the Champagne Facility " New Light " , from the order of the Minister for Property and Land Relations of Crime, Anna Anuchina.
100% of the shares of the company will remain in the state of Crime.
The statutory capital of the shareholder society will be 595.5 million and will consist of 5.955 million normal shares at a nominal value of 100 rows each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crime stated that, if no funds for modernization of the company are available within the next three years, the factory would be threatened to stop.
The core funds for enterprises are about 60 to 70 per cent.
The company needs 1.2 billion rubs to be modernized, and it is obliged to pay 50 per cent of the revenue of the budget.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"Receiving money from the owner is a problem, talking about taking loan funds of large credit organizations is difficult," said Mr. Minselhos Crimea Sergei Petelin in April this year.
Parliament of Crime included an enterprise in the project plan for privatization for 2017.
It was proposed to be carried out and traded.
The source of Interfax in the Crime authorities evaluated the possible sales value of $40 million, the investment in modernization, $30 million.
In 2016, the New Light increased the production of played wine by 2.8 per cent compared to the level of 2015 to 1.5 2 million bottles.
In 2017, the New Light was intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by the Prince of Lion Golicin as a grass wine factory in the acquired name of the New World.
The plant is located on 11 acres of the earth.
Third-class undergrounds destroyed more than 40 nadhrobs
The MDG staff in the Netherlands have established citizens who destroyed 46 nadgrobts at the cemetery of Liscovo.
Intelligence students of the third class were found.
The first statement that the grave plates were damaged by unknown were received in the OMWD of Russia on the Liskov region on 27 June.
24 people have contacted the police about this.
As a result, the Criminal case on Article 244 of the RF " Destruction, damage or distortion of funeral sites " was launched.
Following the investigation, the police had established suspects, and two students aged 8 and 9 years old.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing the monuments falling, and that motivated them to do huliganism.
Children and their parents have been conducted preventive activities.
Italy strengthens the tone of NGO ships rescuing migrants.
Italy warned NGOs belonging to rescue courts in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue their work unless they were subject to new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new code of behaviour, it is hard to say if they can continue their activities," said the Minister for Interior, Mario Minniti, to the Turistic daily newspaper Stampa.
Minnity's warning sounded the next day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization, Yugend Rettet, suspected that his crew actually cooperates with traffickers and facilitates illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which worked for a year, rejected the comments on the substantive detailed charges against it by the Italian Prosecutor Ambrodjo Cartozio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains a higher priority, so we regret that we cannot now continue in the search and rescue zone," said the social statement of the organization.
"We can evaluate all the charges raised now, only after we collect all the information and we can evaluate the situation."
The Italian authorities have been watching the Juventa ship belonging to Jugend Rettet since October.
His crew is suspected that he took all the rescue boats to the ship of migrants whom traffickers sent directly to them and allowed smugglers to leave with the boats they could use again.
At least one such meeting was expected to be only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, as stated in the articles of the accusations which were published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violations of the provisions of the Italian coastal authorities that control rescue operations in this area, rather from humanitarian zeal than by any other motivation.
The Code of Behaviour assumes primarily that the Juventa court will have a Italian police officer on board, who will monitor their activities.
As long as only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the Code of " Kids", the Maltese MOAS and the "Pro-Active Expanded Arms" of Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that the new rules were considered unnecessary but acceptable, provided that they would not bring any " significant changes or disturbance" to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, the Nobel Prize was also received by the Nobel Prize " Doctors Without Borders " (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said that the rapid decrease in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support the Libyan Coast Safety and cooperate with local mayors were fruitful.
"In the last days we began to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He reported plans for further negotiations with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we don't want to associate any part of the conflict."
The RF authorities have recently reinforced their policy in the Libyan direction, and with visits to Moscow, there have been delegations of opposing the Libyan parties.
The Chief of the Russian Intra-Energy Contact Group, the Assistant Chief of the Chechen Republic of Lev Dengov, told the " E" objectives of Moscow in this region and on whom it is betting.
The Libyan contact group that you lead is almost nothing.
Let's say that the Ukraine contact group knows about it.
And here's the secret curtain.
What exactly do you do, what goals are you pursuing?
The contact group was established by the MID RF and State thought initiative.
Her activities are governed by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Michael Bogdanov and Adam Delimhanov (Deputy of Doma from Chechnya. - " A").
The latter is authorized to work on the Lebanese Speaker of the State of Vecheslav Vladini.
The force to establish a group was to detention in Libya of the Russian Chebotrev Mechanical tanker (September 2015) on board. - " A").
We've been thinking about helping the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State, supported our work by Chechny Ramzan Kadirov.
And how did it happen that you were the head of her?
Since I worked for Libya since 2008, I was asked to head the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of the seamen from the Chebotareva Mechanics.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all the major groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and with Tripoli (which is founded by the United Nations Government, headed by Faiz Saradž. - " A") and with Tobruk (residence of Parliament, which opposes the Government and supports the marshal of Halif Haftar, which controls the eastern regions of Libya. - " A").
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metiga (deputy Prime Minister of Libya-E), we have reached a quick agreement on the release of Russian seamen.
At that time, it was decided to create a contact group to use these contacts more effectively.
Its task is to analyse the environment, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties of the conflict.
I would like to emphasize: In Libya, we do not want to associate with any of the parties of the conflict, but we have dialogue with everyone.
How many people are involved in the contact group, and how many of them are constantly in Libya?
Five people are now involved in the contact group.
Among them are people with experience in force structures, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also want to put together a group of experts on the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East of RAN.
There is no one in Libya all the time when there is no need.
Is there now Russian military advisers in Libya, instructors.
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military experts in Libya.
All conversations and publications are not true.
But your contact group, former troops...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot points.
Or closed up to a certain moment for us, such as Missurata (which is based on the teams of the bands that played a role in the promotion of the Libyan leader Moammar Kaddafi in 2011, and the substantial intensity of the subsequent years. - " A " ).
We arrived to Missurate in January this year.
We were frightened, said there were all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to appreciate the situation there, to analyse the real military capacity, which is responsible for why rumors are actually the role of Islamists.
In Missurate, we met with all the representatives of the teams that were engaged in the destruction of the IH in Sirta (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was launched from the warriors prohibited in Russia by the Islamic State - " A " ).
We wanted to look at them, meet these people, check out the information that they played a crucial role in the destruction of the IG in Libya, not Halifa Huftar, who had attributed these credits to themselves.
And what's your conclusion?
Islamic State in Libya won not Haftar?
That's not what he was doing.
Haftar performed operations on another front, in Bengasi.
And the IGs in Sirta fought the structures subjected to the Government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited people in Russia to carry out this anti-terrorism operation.
And they arrived, extended from 19 to 23 April this year, the Lebanese delegation adopted in the Federation Council, Duma, MID and Rosguard.
You are, as we understand, in all the Libyan regions and are likely to imagine the mood of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think that the ceasefire agreements, the elections reached at the end of July in Paris, Halifa Haftar and Faiz Saradge, will be able to implement?
Or again, as this has been happening repeatedly in the past, will the agreements be collapsed, the fighting acts will renew, the parties will try to take power alone?
For us, it was a good signal that Saraj and Haftar agreed to a regular meeting, not long ago.
In the past, both leaders have responded very negatively to each other.
What about the position of Russia...
They often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, and many believe that.
We faced this situation when we were in Missurate, and Haftar was on board that day by the Russian aircraftman Admiral Kuznezov.
It was a coincidence.
But the Missurate did not believe in coincidence.
We were told, "You must be very brave people who came to us today."
But our task is to show that we are not only supporting Haftar, we have a dialogue with all key conflict participants in Libya.
You and Haftar were in contact.
Does the understanding of Russian partners at the human, emotional level facilitate the fact that he studied twice in the SSSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
He's Russian if he knows, it's very relative.
But what he was learning from us, of course, makes dialogue easier with him.
Not just with him, by the way.
When we communicate with troops in Tripoli and Missurate, we meet generals who were either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And here they speak beautifully Russian.
And they're drawn to Russia, somehow, they're having nostalgia on it.
Do you consider the possibly rapid cancellation of the arms embargo on Libya?
Are your Libyan interviewers interested in the delivery of Russian weapons?
They are, of course, interested, but, as I said, we are not taking a side in this conflict and we would not want to arm one another to harm others.
We would like everyone to be in some equal positions.
With regard to the arms embargo, the Libyans are constantly calling for Russia to make it possible.
In Libya, the constitution process is now in progress.
We hope that the parties will make compromise decisions, reach internal consensus.
Then the elections were to take place, as was said at the meeting of Saraja and Haftar.
If the elections take place and finally be elected by the legitimate authority (and now no party has such status), it can be asked in the United Nations to remove the arms embargo.
To raise this issue now is meaningless and dangerous, it will only lead to the escalation of the conflict.
The media reported that Italy, faced the problem of African refugees from Libya, felt abandoned by EU allies.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation using their links with the Levians?
For example, how realistic is the possibility that the Haftar teams will establish coastal control and end the business of smugglers transferring immigrants to Europe?
It's a very timely question.
We're working on it actively.
The Italians need Russia ' s support, because Moscow has dialogue with Haftar and Saraje and with Missurate and Southern.
The tribes in the south of Libya play a great role in this issue, and they are willing to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about the Southern to cross the flows of migrants on a long way?
So, in terms of terms, were the buses back in which the Nigerian migrants ride?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in continuing these streams.
We are hoping to make the Southern part of the negotiating process between Saraje, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But for the beginning, we would like to see the unity of the view on this issue between Haftar and Saradž.
The head of the Government in Tripoli, Faiz Sarazge, is considered Islamic, a party to the country's standards of sharia.
How many radical views does he hold?
Would this not be an obstacle to acquiring relations with Russia or the West?
I will express my personal opinion on him.
In my view, he's the opponent of radical Islam.
But Islamist is in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya must be an absolutely normal country - moderately Islamic, open world.
He also actively combat terrorists.
Why does he have that reputation?
It was created by those countries who were not interested in the communication of Russia with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, there is a legislative, executive and judicial authority.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other public structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in keeping us out of the way.
And we mixed all their maps and started actively to communicate with Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we already have the fruits of this work: Rosnefth has concluded a collaboration with the State oil company of Libya - NOC.
Director of NOC, Mustaf Sanalla, who was head of Rosnefty, Igor Secin, himself from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of the Libyan oil of the Roseft.
What will Russia do to her?
I guess to sell again.
What other economic interests do Russia have in Libya?
In the plans, the contracts in Muammar Caddafi will be signed.
This includes, inter alia, previous arrangements in the transport sphere (the construction of railways), energy (electricity) and a number of others.
Do the Levians have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
So, like with Iran, is the oil scheme in exchange for services?
I don't know what the scheme is going to be, I don't do this directly.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not essential.
We're actually doing peacekeeping work there.
It is essential for us to stop bloodshed, to help the Libyans make arrangements, so that they can set up orders and Libya has no longer been a favourable environment for terrorism development.
For Russia, this is the main task of helping the Libyan people and pushing terrorists from there.
Do you have any information about the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical warriors from Russia or other countries of the former SSSR?
One of the challenges of our contact group was to find out.
I met with the representative of the Libyan Committee for State Security, which said that there is no outlaw from Russia for today and other countries of the former SSSR.
He said that he had about 50,000 telephone records of representatives of Islamic and radical groups (in Libya. - A) and the Russian speech there does not sound.
And from what states are these warriors then?
I don't want to get into these details.
Then let's formulate the question differently.
How many of the Islamist fighters in Libya themselves?
There are almost no Libyans, not more than 5%.
The rest are coming.
Can Moscow hold internal negotiations like Paris?
That's the plan.
We have active negotiations with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow and have declared that we are willing to return to Moscow or Grozni.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say.
There must be a few more visits, and then, I hope, there will be clarity on the time and place of negotiations.
In the Czech Museum, charities collected money for a dear gift to a sick boy
The Nine-year-old Sasha Macola boy, who has a HCP, a brain hydrocephalia and a full blindness, will receive a specialized runway on 5 August.
A useful present will be provided by the Minister of Culture of Moscow, Oxana Kosareva, and the Director of the Constantine Bobkov Museum.
Money for the training was gathered during the charity marathon “Do not be tired of doing good ” that took place in Melich on 15 July on the Day of Chechov.
Before the marathon in the museum, Sashi, who lived in the village of Manuškino of the Czech Republic, received a letter: "I don't have eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I'd really like to get a runway as a gift to make my feet strong, and I'd learn to walk a little bit."
And then Sashina's dream came true!
After handing it to the Museum Commander, the Concert Postscriptum will be held, a well-known pianist, a deserved Russian artist, Alexander Gindin, will perform popuri from popular classic productions.
During the charitable marathon in Melichov, the Horn of the David Desert of Uznes, Illia Drozdichin, students of the Moscow Conservatory of P.I. Chaikovski and Russian Academy of the name of Gnesini, the artists of the Melichovian Theatre " Chechow Study " .
Auctions were conducted for visitors, a book fair and a charity sale of suvenir products with a maraton logo.
The Museum Commander of Melichovo launched the Memorial Day on 15 July for the only day of charity in all Podmoskovian museums.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk of the Lifemire area near the local football stadium has shot several times to the adolescents that were there.
According to the suspect, he was angered by noise, informed by the FACTAM at the Lithuanian Police Communications Division.
After that, a man entered a cafeteria nearby.
He had a conflict in the building, during which a man used a tire bullet device to shoot, wounding one of the visitors.
A 34-year-old victim was provided with the necessary medical assistance, no threat to his life.
The police and ambulance have arrived at the scene, but the arrows have arrived.
The law enforcement officers established his identity and detained the same day, on 2 August.
The man couldn't explain his actions.
He's got a tire bullet fire device to be sent to an expertise.
The Criminal Code of Ukraine has been initiated by this fact.
The detainee is threatened to be imprisoned for a period of 3 to 7 years.
Recall, in Kiev in Lukianovka, at Tatar Street at night on 28 July, there was a shooting attack.
Michelle Carter's sentence for messages that caused Conrad Roy's suicide
The Massachusettian was sentenced to two and a half years of detention for her text messages and phone calls to suicide by her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, now 20 years old, will have to spend 15 months in prison and 5 years of testing period.
In June, Carter was found guilty of the undue murder of Conrad Roy, who killed herself on 13 July 2014.
The father of Roy said on the hearings on Thursday, "My family was killed by grief.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free before the appeal.
She was in a maximum period of 20 years, but her lawyers claimed that she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream shirt, listened to the sentence of standing, shaking her hands and putting his eyes down.
"It killed Conrad Roy by its actions," said the prosecutor.
"She interrupted his life to improve her own.
She did not accept responsibility," she said.
"She has not shown repentance."
But attorney Carter said it was a "tragic case she regretted deeply."
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that it considered her "a age, maturity, or even mental illness not to have significantly affected its actions".
The prosecutor read Roy Lynn Roy's mother, saying, "I hadn't passed any day when I would not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I do - I try to support his sisters despite all the pain that will remain with us forever," he says.
Sister Roya Camdin Roy said that she was inherently persecuted by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become aunts of his children.
"Being a man who has always been with me since I was born is the pain that will remain with me for the rest of my life," she said.
This case would appear to be a legal precedent, since there was no law in Massachusetts that would be responsible for the advice of a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roya was found dead in the car with carbon poisoning symptoms, Carter was 17 years old.
The case drew attention to the whole country when it was known that Carter had been forced to suicide.
"You can hang, jump from the roof, beat yourself with a knife, I don't know many ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before he died when he rested with his family.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "You just have to turn the light on, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted to pay attention to Roy's death, and forbidded her to communicate with the press so she could not get what she wanted.
The views of the lawyers were divided.
One of the few who protected Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for the murder of her British neighbour in Italy and justified two years later.
A 30-year-old Knox published a special opinion in Los Angeles Times, saying, "Michel Carter deserves sympathy and assistance, not prisons."
Eugene Богаchev: "I let Langford go as a bird of high flight."
One of the best basketball players of the One League of WTB 33-year-old Keith Langford left the UNICS.
The withdrawal of the American Protector to the Notifications commented on the President of the UNICSA Eugene Богаtchev.
Keith took this decision under the family circumstances,” said Eugene Богаtchev.
He has a little child, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to the house.
I decided to go see him.
Of course, I could have said no and extended his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played three seasons in the UNICSE and showed a high level in each match, all 100 per cent.
So I let him go as a bird of high flight.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in family life and game career.
Keith Langford won the Cain Club for three years, conquering the silver of the Single League-2015/16.
In season-2016/17, he received the award of the most efficient player in the Euroliga season.
He picked up 21,75 points in the middle for the game.
This is the second result since 2004, when the award was established.
Langford, who also won the prize in 2014, became a second player in the Euroliga history who received this prize more than once.
Langford will sign a contract with the Chinese Shanghan, informed Eurohoops.
The American is expected to conclude a two-year contract of $5 million.
Langford will be the second of July the Euroliga star, which is turning into a Chinese championship.
Previously, Janis Burusis, former Panatinaicos, had been transferred to the Chinese CBA.
A tourist from Podmoskov was evacuated by a helicopter in Adigea
Today, the Adigean rescueers evacuated from the mountain region of a submoscical tourist who received the strongest sunflamming.
The man rested at the Fisht shelter at 1.6000 metres high.
A 27-year-old tourist had increased pressure and a difficult breath.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic response.
The rescue manager of the tournament group said that the men had been burned in the march.
Audi will be modified to 850 000 diesel vehicles
On a day before the Audi announcement, BMW stated that it would propose to update software for more than 350 000 vehicles.
The President of BMW said that the company considered that “there are more intelligent ways than driving restrictions”, in view of European cities, including München, where BMW was located, which considered the possibility of prohibiting or restricting the use of diesel vehicles.
"Dimmler said on Thursday that he modified three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel explosion.
None of the companies call their step back.
European autoproducers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to facilitate compliance with CO2 rules.
But nitrogen oxides that throw diesel engines are considered cancerogene and can cause astma.
The value for autoproducers of equipment that is neutralizing diesel gases is also increased, and the competitive price of vehicles becomes difficult.
While the German autoproducers were under remark, the Government of Chancellor Angela Merkel also accused the Government of the Government of Angela Merkel that it entailed influential autoproducers and ignored the signs of the problem.
Companies try not to repeat the errors of Folkswagen, which hid the use of so-called defeat devices that could correct the number of damaged gases during the testing to comply with the rules and to disable the normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several leaders of Folkswagen were convicted, others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in Germany, the former head of the Termodynamic Division was arrested as part of the Audi engine development team.
The former manager, Zakkeo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and may be brought to trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi had been under the German criminal investigation with Folkswagen, after the authorities accused the Audi system of setting up the European Emission Rules and extended the investigation that had previously been focused on the United States.
The Inclusion of Audi in the investigation may create serious problems to Folkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is a source of unproportionately large share of Folkswagen income.
In Astrahani, a cafeteria visitor paid for false money
The police received a message from the bank office employee on the finding of money from the summary of 5000 rubles.
A study conducted at the Expert Criminal Centre showed that it was false.
According to the UMVD of Russia on the Astrahan area, one of the cafeteria visitors purchased a shourma.
It should be noted that the cartridge had not been equipped with the instrument of determining the validity of the monetary.
The police are currently established by persons involved in the production and acquisition of a fake CBF ticket.
Such crimes are punished by deprivation of liberty for up to 8 years, with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the IMD calls on the Astrahan residents to be careful in carrying out financial operations; it is recommended that trade workers establish instruments to check the validity of the receiving funds.
The astronomers found a hell planet on which even iron can flood.
For the first time, after studying the properties of the giant exoplanet strategy called WASP-121b, the astrophysics were surprised by its temperature that was able to evaporate iron and other metals.
The specialists pointed out that the molecules of water are so warm in the light of the star that they release infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope sealed the molecules of water on this gas giant: this high temperature forces water in the planet's atmosphere to shine in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called " burning jupiters " - gas giants, by size and mass compared to the largest planet of the Solar System, but located ten times closer to the parental star.
This year, only 1.3 " earthly " days" lasts on the exoplanet, and its gas shelter is at almost 2.500 degrees Celsia.
Climate change threatens labanda in Provance.
It became a symbol of Prowans and Southern France, but now it is fearful that it is threatened by climate change.
Labanda has grown worse because of dry weather and insect diseases; this has resulted in a constant headache of scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provance, said: “Lavanda in Prowansa is really threatened, because in recent years the plant has felt the impact of climate change: spring and especially rainfall has become much less.
This affects the lifetime of the Labanda.
There are also small cycades jumping into the leaves of insects, carrying microbacteria; they become very dry in the very dry weather."
There's a lot on the map.
Labanda does not only attract holidays; laband oil is very excited in perfume and cosmetology.
Eric Shas says, "Instead of very long wheels with a large number of colors, we have small, undeveloped, weak, or even missing.
So we have less parts containing ether oil."
The decisions that are currently under consideration include improving the distribution of water and slowing out of soil, as well as the spraying of plants with the protective mixture of clay and water and the derivative of species more sustainable to drought.

The words of Medvedev were commented in the State Department
The official representative of the United States Department, Heather Nauert, commenting on the briefing of the words of Prime Minister of RF Dmitri Medvedev, stated that the need to find " areas for interaction" with Russia.
She said that such areas should be found to " improve bilateral interaction".
A example of such successful cooperation, Nauerth referred to the Syrian reconciliation agreement.
We're two nuclear supernationals.
"And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other," said the diplomat.
At the same time, Nauerth refused to comment on the statement of Medvedev on the full trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia said that, of course, she has the right to speak, but I can't say anything more about it," said the representative of the State.
Previously, US President Donald Tramp signed a draft law on the reinforcing of sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the head of the Government of the Medvedev stated that Washington announced a full trade war to Moscow, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that the United States sanctions would work for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister considers the United States Expository of Trump.
The missing in the Podmoskovje bodibilder was found on a foreign daily for lost memory.
Bodibilder Shamil Hanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on 25 July under very picant circumstances: he left the car salon to go to the bathroom.
Seven days he was unsuccessfully searched for by the known and local inhabitants.
And Shamille was found in a strange house in Ramenia.
He was completely naked in his toilet.
The Daguestan sportsman couldn't explain how he got here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and his passport was missing.
Personality was helped by the announcements of his disappearance.
The arrivals of the healthcare have reported that Hanmet had a partial memory loss and a brain trauma, according to the Mash publik.
The sportsmen are probably waiting for other surprises.
The perpetrators who kidnapped Shamil had probably already been in his apartment, and the keys were also stolen from him.
Oil income of July exceeded 7.4 billion rubles
In fact, oil income received on July 2017 exceeded the estimate of 7.4 billion rubs, reports the Ministry of Finance of the RF.
The excess, as explained by the agency, has been primarily due to a higher exchange rate of US dollar to a rubber compared to the average monthly value of June used for the evaluation, as well as to the excess of the actual gas supply and exports of oil products projected by the levels.
"The deviation of the oil income of the federal budget from the monthly assessment corresponding to the Federal Federal Budget Act for 2017-2019 is projected in August 2017 by +40.2 billion rubs."
Thus, the total amount of funds aimed at purchase of foreign currency in the internal currency market from 7 August to 6 September 2017 is 47.6 billion rubs.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of foreign currency would be 2.07 billion bucks.
Foreign currency operations by Minfin will be drawn from the Russian Bank.
Each working day during that period, the CB will conclude agreements on the purchase of foreign currency in the organised trades of the Moscow market during the trade day.
The acquired foreign currency will be accounted for the Federal Treasury in the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes that Mexico is getting more dangerous.
Participants in the weekly newspaper Riodose are usually meeting on Wednesday to discuss plans for the lighting of the recent crimes of violence in Sinaloa, related to organized crime, corrupted officials or continuing war of narcotics.
But today, when they were depressed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told that they should change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking children to the office that was already thrown into, or leaving them home in 2009.
Security experts wrote on the board hanging in the room, three words: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name the names for each column - no evidence needed, suspicions and internal feelings would be sufficient.
These are drug dealers, policies, businessmen, journalists who are suspected that they are on the contents of the government or cartels, the whole list of subtles, which caused the work on the lighting of chaos in Mexico.
Violence does not give peace, and among the corpses that are multiplying in the country, more and more journalists: according to the Committee's Protection Committee, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Neito took his post in December 2012; 589 people after attacks and threats are under federal protection; and this year, at least seven people died in seven states.
Among the last are their publisher and inspirer, the Coordinator of Riodose, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdes in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence feels very sharp, although his presence is a wide picture of Waldes, showing the middle finger, with the title "Factness" hangs in the Riodose building; two reporters over 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear shirts on which his smile, the face in his glasses or his firm panama.
The seminar goes less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although the Office of the Special Federal Prosecutor was organized in 2010 to investigate journalist cases, only two cases have been investigated, according to the Committee's Protection of journalists.
As in the case of the majority of thousands of killings per year related to drug trafficking and organized crime, journalists are rarely sued.
Riodose journalists insist that they will write about violence in Sinaloa, although they are killed by grief, although around now is much more dangerous.
Without information about murderers, without justice from the security talks at meetings, Ibarra said.
"It's very stupid to waste time on this seminar," he says.
"We don't know the reason, we suspect everyone."
Morning on May 15, Valdes left Riodose's office at the capital of Culiakana.
He was able to drive only a few blocks before his red Toyota Corroll was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the title of the newspaper, which means "Tweteenth River".
The shooter left on his car and broke it nearby.
Waldes was 50 years old.
He had a wife and two adult children left.
The hearings are usually rapidly spreading across Kuliakan.
But about Waldes, they're almost all silent.
Since Guzman was arrested and issued in the United States in January last year, Sinaloa became one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, since competitive fractions have fought to fill the educated vacuum.
Let's not talk about killing one or more people on the streets of Sinaloa every day, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated two - floor mausoleums of narcotics, which are more than homes of many living people.
Forget for a minute that the state of calm is just when one of the cartels takes control of the maritime state with important ports and roads of drug trafficking in the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdes knew very well about the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, 60-year-old co-based and Riodose director, was overwhelmed by the feeling of guilt for not being able to protect a friend.
He thinks the murder was helped with two mistakes.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the competitive cartel fractions that fight with Guzman's sons.
The publication could be angry with the sons; people who were allegedly members of the gang have gathered all copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosk.
The second mistake was that he didn't force Waldes to leave the country for his own security after another newspaper was captured.
Waldez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was considered as a continuous vacation in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He was leaving the danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter in Norroest, and in 2003 he and his five colleagues founded Riodose, selling his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, “the journalist could not be dealt with without dealing with drugs”, said Bohorkes.
In time, the newspaper earned the reputation of brave and honest publication, sales and advertising income.
The journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, but attracted readers that they could read about what no one dared to write.
Eight years later, Riodose received a prestigious prize of Maria Murs Cabo for the reporting work in Latin America.
The same year, Valdes won the International Prize of Freedom of the Press for courage in the investigation of the drug trafficking in Mexico, no matter where it leads.
He honestly confessed that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ fee.
Trafficking in Sinaloa -- "it's a lifestyle," he said in October last year at the Rompeviento TV interview.
"You have to take the tasks that lie on you as a journalist, or you're just a fool."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you tell me what's going on?"
Riodose workers miss Waldes, a joker who was arguing as a carrier in the port, a friend, generous for hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to meet alive.
They relied on the order they had.
He was always supposed to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, a bar across the office, and always sitting there at the same table.
Now they ask: Has it been destroyed by love for a single order?
His death also caused them to doubt their accounts of how better to do their work and remain alive.
"They don't like when you know about their wives, children, their legal business and their landing airports for drug carriage.
"These things were behind the line," said Bohorkes.
The result, even in the best times, was the high level of self-conservation and the pursuit of self-saving.
We have to trust our instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says the Riodose editor Andres Villiareal, is that "threatening can be deceived... and then happens what happened to Javier."
The old rules, said he and others, are no longer acting in Sinaloa -- as in Tamaulipas, Veracrus, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mixture of profitable smuggling ways, weak public institutions and corrupted officials.
Landshaft is changing all the time.
In a room where Riodose staff were gathered for security training, the phones were suddenly prohibited: a few days earlier, it was known that spy programmes that were sold exclusively to Governments were used in Mexico to monitor journalists and public activists.
Two police officers are hiding outside in the shadows of the tree from a 104-degree heat (40 degrees per Celsia).
They had been assigned to the Government to protect the Riodose office, which was located in a four-hour building in the burzevas block of Culiacana.
Some journalists half-fuckingly asked whether these policemen were involved in 50 per cent of the orders that the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that de facto was under control of drug trafficker gangs.
The next number of Riodos was three main topics.
It's a murder in Sinaloa's brother's former champion of the Julio Sezar Chaves box.
They also had the disclosure of government costs concentrated in the Governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping of people in one of the most expensive Culiacana restaurants, in the neighborhood of the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so we had to be cautious when it was time to write that everyone in the city knew that it was the favorite restaurant of drug dealers and authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from the open databases that the restaurant was registered on behalf of the policy belonging to the ruling institutional revolutionary party (PRI), which had dominated at all levels of power during almost the past century.
Several governors of the PR have recently been accused of corruption.
Villareal asked journalists to write about the previous incidents in this restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo Guzman slipped out of the army.
A few months ago, readers would have searched for a Valdes column with the most reliable information about the kidnapping.
"In the past, we would have known what happened," said 46-year-old Villiareal, for his thin body, called El Flaco.
"All communication channels to our sources are broken up today."
The Valdes cabinet is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers with protests against the murders of journalists, because the staff have become what they never thought to become: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
The journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posts and went to the local prosecutor's demonstration next morning.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacan in the west of the country three days after Valdes was killed.
Found a burned body, and the authorities claimed it was on the basis of DNA tests.
The journalists throughout the country began to speak loudly, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the sides and walls of houses.
That day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, trying to provide international support in the demand of justice in the case of Waldes.
At the meeting with Governor Sinaloa the next day after the murder of Waldes Ramirez, she accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
She then asked her not to give more tasks to light the government, fearing that her anger would harm its objectiveity.
Valdes has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "occupied" by organized crime, its co-participants in the Government and the indifferent society.
In his last book of Narcotics, he wrote that the reporters are not only killing drug dealers; they do so on the orders of politicians and security services in a warranty of organized crime.
The Press Protection Committee, Article 19, believes that half the attacks on journalists last year were committed under the order of police and government officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you," said Ramirez.
Of course, murders scare people.
Everyone remembers the death of Mary's blogger, Elizabeth Massias, six years ago in the northern border state Tamaulipas.
Her body was found by a note suggested by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and the earrings were lying next to her head cut off.
Some publications preferred to close as El Norte's newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent Miroslav Britch was killed in March.
Others continue to be like El Manyana from Nuevo Laredo after her leader was killed in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Sudad Juarez publicly addressed drug cartels through a drafting article on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists left their home states or even a country.
It's a painful decision.
The exile is difficult to find jobs, and they continue to look at the danger on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as it obviously happened to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 with four women in the apartment in Mexico three months after the escape from Veracrus.
Those who remain and continue to work are daily balanced between risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits he's afraid of writing about drug trafficking.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he said.
Last Friday, midnight, when the last issue was ready for printing, the Riodose publishers sat on the trip next to the office and drinked a beer when their phones called at the same time.
A series of shootings between the opposing gangs and the security forces near the city of Masatlan left 19 dead bodies behind.
The war continued to burn, as promised in a series of cartel messages found in the area.
By sitting on the trip, they put news on the Riodos website on their mobile phone.
The next day, the first page was to be rewrited.
Nearby the sirens were raised, another shooting in the neighborhood.
Bohorques has checked whether they are ready to defend their police guards.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
By sitting under a huge portrait of the dead founder of their newspaper, whose average finger was exposed to the entire Sinaloa, the Riodos workers continued.
"How can you think of shutting up," said Bohorkes, "if the day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her out to report?"
Dinosaur used a camouflage to avoid enemies
At first, it seems to be a statue, although a horror.
Researchers reported that the first unbelievable residues of an incredible substance of the nosorogue discovered by the Canadian miner were so well stopped that the experts called it "Mona Lisa among dinosaurs " .
It was so well retained that they could even determine that the color of his scratched skin was red and brown - and that he had, in some way, a "familiar past".
The report published in the Modern Biology magazine described as “the best preserved in Tyreofor in the history of findings and one of the best copies of dinosaur in the world”.
This is the recently found copies of nodosaurus living in the middle of the mellime period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His unbelievable well-being was shocked by researchers who call him "really great".
This grass-eating tireophor is the best preserved species in the history of findings, according to articles in National Geographic.
He was found by Sean Fank when he was working at the Sancore Millennium Millenium near the Fort McMurrey in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He encountered something that seemed to be different from the other species, and he decided to look more carefully.
The founder was sent to the Royal Tirrellian Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, the discovery of an animal inside the earthly depth was a mass of 2500 feet (1100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the complete result can be demonstrated.
“It's only worth a little bit of screwing, and it's practically possible to believe that he's asleep” said the leading author Caleb Brown, a scientist of the Royal Tyrella Paleontological Museum, where the creation is demonstrated.
“He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-saved copies of dinosaurs, Mona Lisa, among the dinosaurs.”
Studying his skin, researchers discovered that it was grass-eating, despite the fact that it was covered by the pants and that it was like a walking tank, apparently a significant danger from meat-eating dinosaurs.
This powerful pants of dinosaur used red-white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as a protective paint, which is also used by many animals of our day.
This would allow him to combine quickly with the environment and to avoid enemy meetings, the experts said, assuming he was hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This creature, aged 110 million years of age, was widely highlighted in the print in May, and is now exposed in the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
Scientists have already studied the animal and gave it the name of Borealopelta markmitchelli in the museum lab of Mark Mitchell, one of the participants of a group spent over 7,000 hours behind his scratch.
The surprising preservation of the copies allowed Dr. Mitchell and the international group of scientists to document the painting and form of garlic and pancil plates on his body.
They discovered a protective color, a widespread protection method in the kingdom of animals, which means that the superiority of the creature was the darkest of its lower side.
Although the defense is well-proliferated, the opening has become unexpected because the size of Borealopelta is significantly greater than the size of the living animals now.
It could be assumed that the dinosaur was so actively hunted by meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution had preferred the masking of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals with protective decoration — such as deer, zebra, or armonos — are much smaller and are more accessible, which indicates that nodosaurus had to fight seriously for survival.
“The serious threat of predators to the massive, potent dinosaur pants shows how dangerous the predator dinosaurs of the Mel period were,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the cherries of dinosaurs also indicates that his skin should be red and brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the preserved content of its food tract, to find out what he had eaten during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken into the sea, where he drowned and with his back on the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as now in southern Florida, and the rivers and oceans were probably far far further than now.
“This nodosaurus is indeed noted by the full cover of the preserved scratched skin, while he remained fully in three dimensions by preserving the original animal form”, said Brown.
“The animals now look almost as they seemed in the early melting period.
There is no need to be much of the imagination to rebuild it, but it is just a little harder to be stuck, and it is practically possible to believe that it is sleeping."
The mellitus is the age when giant teropodes, meat-eating dinosaurs standing on two legs walked around the earth.
Although the most wonderful of them, the rex tyrannosaurus, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, a tireophor could be hunted by one of his dreadful ancestors.
They include acrocantosaurus, a monster long 38 feet (11.5 meters) weighing six tons.
Scientists whose recent openings are published in the Modern Biology magazine believe that Borealopelta was taken to the sea after death and mumified in the sea.
The creature was found by Sean Fank when he was working in the Millennium Millenium mine near Fort McMurrey in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to the museum staff, it is the best preserved tireophor in the world, along with the skin and pants, and it is the goal, from the turkey to the bones of the bone.
In the average, they reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (300 pounds).
Their mark was two twenty-third-second slippers from their shoulders.
Researchers believe that this grass-eating tireophor had been hard on the fact that it is now Canada until the rainfalled river took him into the open sea.
But the underwater buried the dinosaur kept his vest precisely to the smallest details.
The stone remains of this specific copy have been so well stored that the skin remains are still covering the buggy pancil plates along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greško wrote in the article for National Geographic magazine, the level of preservation of “a rare, such as winning in the lottery”.
The longer I look at him, the more impressive he seems.
The stone remains of the skin are still covering buggy pancil plates that sew the skull of the animal.
His right front leg is stretched along the side, five fingers are turned up on it.
I can count the squirrels on his suit."
Michael Saacashvili was able to get to Poland without documents
Michael Saacashvili, former leader of Georgia and then the Odessa area in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
He did this without a record of his identity and nationality.
The arrival of Saacashvili was reported by the Polish Television Republic, which placed a video on its YouTube channel.
Sakashvili made an anniversary of the Warsaw rebellion against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to speak in this language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician addressed the topics of Georgia's cooperation with Poland, and also spoke of Ukraine.
The fact that Ukraine's migration service deprived his citizenship, the oppressive politician found out in the United States.
How exactly he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents yet unknown.
The former Governor of the Odessa area, Mikhail Saacashvili, stated that his signing on the survey for Ukraine's citizenship was fake.
The politician emphasized that he did not fill in any poll.
Date of investigation on Weinzicher and Olhovik extended until January
The period of preliminary investigation on the owner of the Renova Group of Eugenia Olhowik and the head of the Energyholding T Plus Boris Weinzicher was extended until 2 January 2018.
Thursday, 3 August, the Basman Court considers the prolongation of domestic arrests to the accused.
The representative of the CC at the meeting reported the decision to extend the preliminary investigation last time.
“The specific complexity and length of the investigation is due to the need for exemption and examination of a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigations in the territory of several entities of the RF”, the investigator said.
He added that suspects were regularly bribed to the Comi leadership.
Their total size is estimated at least a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Winsicher, Olchovik, as well as the former WHO leader of " Complex Energy Systems " Michael Slobodin, who had been headed by the " Wympelk" by 5 September, was transferred bribes to the highest officials of the Republic of Komi for the establishment of maximum benefits of heat and electricity, as well as for the establishment of favourable business conditions.
Weinzicher and Olchovik were detained, staged at Siktivkar and arrested for two months, and Slobodin hid from the investigation and was declared federal search.
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Which streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shaken.
Just a day after the arrival to New York, the visitor of St. Louis was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, watching the Facebook tape on the phone.
She's been in a high school post.
It said, "The police have just killed an eighteen-year-old child, and he's still lying in the middle of the street."
Noting that none of her tapes had kept that information confused, she closed the Facebook and opened a twitter.
There were many users with no one @TheePharoah.
The Reper from the Great St. Louis in real time highlighted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a picture of Brown's lifeless body, spread across the street, where it would be four hours.
"It's wildness," thought Ferrell.
But death wasn't something new for her and her circle.
She postponed the phone, and later tonight she returned to the Twitters about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the signal tape and the screaming people and the man who claimed to be the father of Brown, who was plaqued by saying: “Ferguson's policeman just killed my unarmed son!”
She looked at the direct transmission of the police officer in front of a group of protesters with a lazy dog.
On another video, she said, "I'll kill all of you... animals!"
“It is an unstandard situation”, Ferrell said on her own memories.
"It is not such a murder as those we're used to and which we can call typical.
At that point, I felt a little embarrassed.
I was angry and crying."
She took a ticket back to the flight and flew home the next day.
When she landed at 11 a.m., she took her six - year - old daughter from her father’s house and decided that both of them would be going to Ferguson next morning.
What happened with Ferrell and Ferguson in the next almost three years has become a theme of the new documentary film “Which streets?”, which will appear on the screens on 11 August.
This is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and persistence from the view of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrell traveled to Ferguson with her daughter dressed in flowers and branches under color, they remembered a conversation that had led a number of times before this morning, "on the experience of the black people and their situation."
She remembers saying: “Do you remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed?
We are now going to Ferguson because the policeman killed an eighteen-year-old boy, and that was wrong."
"I couldn't help take it," Ferrell said later.
"What's going on today is the culmination of what's happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it and raise it.
It should not only be well dealt with activism and organization but also understand different levels of experience and their provisions and what we must do to be free to be free.
Even if I can provide her with an environment in which she does not face herself with obvious racism, she is nothing different from any other black girl.
I feel that I would have done her a bad favor if I had prevented her from it."
When they arrived in Ferguson, the first stop was made at South Florissant Road, on the roadway from the police station that became something like a chamber camp, while the activists were waiting for reports of the ultimate failure of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur who cooked lunch packages.
They collected packages and helped distribute them to protesters.
For some reason, Ferrell has developed a new type of activism.
“My activism has changed completely since 9 August”, she said, noting that as a student of the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Association of Sanitary Students, representatives of national minorities, and was dealing with food justice and inequality in the field of health among black communities.
“I had no experience of an organizer.
This has come itself."
A few weeks later, at the evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaa Folayan, one of her companions.
Folayan said that she and her chief operator, Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer, "just wanted to document" events.
Ferrell came to the question, "Do you want to document or try to find a story that can be played?"
This scepticism was provoked by many people, often white, who arrived to the community in order to benefit from its pain and endurance.
As explained in the recent Folayan interview, “We heard that the voices of people who were born and grew up in Ferguson did not fall into the center of attention, and we wanted to do so otherwise”.
Folayan has already joined her companion Damon Davis, a local artist known for its activism on the subject of death penalties.
Its participation accompanied the Ferrell project and six other local residents with whom the team of the " Chi Streets " supported communications for years after Brown's murder.
"In this documentary film, no one speaks for us or to us, we speak," said Davis.
"It was the most important thing to me about how these people will be represented, because this is how I will be represented."
Although the project was aimed not to focus on Ferrell's experience, it was to show that the movement “is not about a rescue leader but how the community is united”, said Folayan, it was the most open participants of the film.
As a result, the “Who Streets?” shows suddenly the personal aspects of the life of Ferrell, for example, how she fell in love and married to her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said, laughing to tell me about the first time she saw a ready product.
"But I understood that when you do such a job and manage black people, there must be some level of vulnerability."
Furthermore, the history of Ferrell again discusses and emphasizes the role of a black homosexual woman in the broader context of the “Life of Blacks is important” movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement -- those who created the tag #BlackLivesMatter in social networks after the murder of a black adolescent Traivon Martin in 2012 -- seem to be homosexual.
"Black homosexual women in the leadership positions support all this movement," says Ferrell. "And all because we're constantly fighting on several fronts.
The black-looking homosexual women have to bear all these burdens."
Folayan agreed with that claim, noting that “the movement, in fact, is supported by black women and many homosexual black women”.
However, she insisted that “is not a case of positive discrimination” and that Ferrell was not elected by the central character of the film because of its distinct characters.
“She was the person who woke up this energy”, she said.
“On the other hand, it is not a coincidence that it was on the first plan, because when ”
You can feel its energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, there have been no filmcams in Ferguson for a long time, but complicated racial relations between the community and the police remain.
Further two and a half years, Ferrell will be on a test time for the road to be blocked during the demonstration.
It describes the social and political atmosphere of a place called a home, just "Bardak " .
She's still holding up for the speech she learned when she walked out of Ferguson's street three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Two El Salvadorian football players disqualified for the bite of U.S. players
El Salvador's footballists, Henry Romero and Darwin Seren, have received long disqualifications for unsported behaviour.
During the fourth-final game of the Golden Cup of Confederation of North and Central America and the Caribbean (KONACAF) the El Salvadorians bite American players.
The first one was Henry Romero's defense.
The El Salvadorian bite the attacker Josie Altidor, then stabbed him behind his chest.
The semi-protector of Seren then bite the US Protector Omar Gonzales at the coal in his penalty square.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches, and Seren was six.
The meeting itself ended by the winning of Americans with account 2:0, transmitted by Goal.com.
Similarity: Artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning DNA
In the center of the Friedman Gallery Hall, in New York, people faces white, black and brown, all unattachedly similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey Harbourg from the cheeks and the hair cuts sent to her Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent circumcisions from the Fort Levenworth prison, where a former intelligence analyst was held a 35-year-old time for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was held on 2 August, is called "Ascension of the Similarity".
This is the result of a two-year census between Dewey Harborg, whose art is combining technology, information and art, and Manning, a trans-sexual woman and a famous disident whom Barack Obama mitigated the sentence only three days before the end of his presidency.
By analyzing the DNA computer programme obtained from Manning, and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of persons who could have a genome of such a genome, Deui Harborg created a depth, although difficult for perception of the manifest, not only on the plasticity of DNA data -- in various ways of interpretation and inherent determination of these interpretations -- but also the concept of identities.
Manning, who was born with Bradley Edward, but since she was a teenager, openly said that she considered herself a woman, was sentenced by 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Act on spying, computer fraud and thief.
Her photos in prison were not available, so only one of its photographs was known: the grain black and white self, on which Manning was in the platine's shade of the feather, apparently embarrassing, sitting behind the car; and it was associated with this photograph.
In 2015, Dewey Harborg successfully completed its 2012 project " Visions of strangers " .
In it, the artist produced portraits of unknown people through the judicial evidence of the type of coppers and gum tire, deducing DNA from this garbage and creating images of how these people could look.
And then she received an e-mail from the Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dewey Hagborg at the preliminary show of a new press exhibition.
At that time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait from her DNA.
Thus, the artist and her musa seated in prison became communicators and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote the book of the Comics " Shoiled Images " , the illustrated Shoeli Canungo, which pictured the way the President would mitigate Chelsea's punishment in the future and can visit the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the book was released was a nice surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong and that the exhibition is opened right now when Donald Trump declares war to people who reveal secret information in the government, and invents new ways to inflammate enemy in Twitter.
When Dewey Harborg asked about the coincidence of all this in time, she said, "Nothing happens accidentally."
In a statement written on the wall of the gallery, a huge signature of Manning below (with a heart instead of a point above " i " in its name) calls upon the end of " automatic division on the basis of sex, race, sexual orientation and culture " .
On the opposite side, its mitochondrial DNA, long gossip from pencil C, G and A.
Includes 200 letters (or nucleotides, as a scientific artist expresses), Deui Harborg hoped to show how amazing we are, in any case, in its biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not define what we are, how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dewey-Harborg; its video work in 2007 "False Memories" is also presented here.
"The DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories here."
The last part of the exhibition placed in the same room is the above-mentioned novel in comic books.
Manning, like King-Cong, appears on the United States Correct Casarm with a speaker in its hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," it says.
"So never shut up."
"This is the direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," said the artist who welcomed us from Philadelphia.
"I still have ants on my skin when I'm talking about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition in person, as it was predictable in the comic books, but when it comes, it will be welcomed by the masks in the center of the room, its own genome simulators gathered as a crowd of protesters.
It was also done intentionally, as everyone on the exhibition to the height (5’2, Manning growth), on which the pencil was drawn by genetic gaplogroups.
"I'd rather hang them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people," says Dewey Harborg about portraits.
"I wanted them to be like a mass movement that was formed around Chelsea, like the movement that was behind her release."
Professor of the Northwest University and Oxford University Officer is searching for the police in charge of murder
According to the police, there is a national burglary on the Professor of the Northwest University and Oxford University staff who are searched for as suspects because a luxury room in Chicago was found to be killed.
According to the Cook Court's protocols, on Monday, the warrants were detained for predicted murder without the right to be released under the guarantee of the 40-year Windem Latem and the fifty-six-year-old Andrew Warren for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, the 20-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after he was injured by multiple wounds.
A warning issued by the Chicago police administration states that the body was found on 27 July.
The police received a call, they arrived in the Grand Plaza apartments and found a victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranlo was declared dead at the scene of the crime, and now detectives are investigating death from knife wounds, considering her as a murder, while the police have hardly searched for two suspects.
Latham has been a microbiology and immunology adjunctor since 2007.
Alan K. Kabadge, Vice-President of the University of Links, reported in an e-mail statement that Latham was at administrative leave and that he was not allowed to attend the Northwest University campus.
"Now this is a criminal case investigated by authorized persons, and the Northwest University is cooperating with the investigation," Kabadj said.
Warren is a senior member of the Oxford University financial bodies.
The representative of the university and Somerville College reported in an e-mail statement: “We have communicated with the British police and are willing to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. investigative bodies.”
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues were in shock and wanted him to surrender.
Chief of the Chicago Police Office, Anthony Gulhelmi, said that he was very advising suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have suggestions of their location, but our attempts to find them are increasing” said Guillemi.
According to Gulhelma, local, regional and federal authorities are assisting in searching for suspects.
According to Gulhelmi, the police officer called the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious report that something happened in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene awful.
Guillelmi reported that it was not clear whether the incident occurred on 27 July itself.
He said the video cameras confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latem and the victim had linked relations," said Gulhelmi.
The Grand Plaza Manual issued an appeal to the lodgers in which it was reported: “The police are currently working on the history of the incident, collecting information on the victim and considering a number of motives, including the possible home incident.”
Russian Vice-Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the WADA road map soon."
The Russian Vice-Prime Minister Vitali Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for resuming the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be fulfilled in the near future.
"A certain phase in compliance with the requirements has been passed, Russia has the right to plan and conduct tests with UKAD (Anti-Ping Agency of the Great Britain).
The BADA road map was updated accordingly," said Mutko on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the VADA road map on the renewal of the status of the Code, which lists the conditions for resuming the work of RUSADA and has recently been published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could represent the complexity for Russia.
"All was announced, everything will be completed.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (MOC) and VADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that the Russian endoping structures should publicly recognize the results of the VADA ordered by Canadian Lawyer Richard McClaren, claiming that the doping in Russian sport is controlled by the State.
With regard to this issue, Mutko said, "We are investigating, because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures were taken.
But there were no government programmes, and we will not admit what was not."
Mutko repeated the words of Vitalia Smirnova, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In the same morning, Smirnov recognized the problems of the Russian antidoping structures in the Russian publication of the Russian Rsport, but added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain disputes and situations.
No one is going to accept this report without requirement," Smirov added.
BADA removed Russia from the doping control in November 2015 after the doping scandal.
However, in June this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate the testing under the monitoring of international experts and the British Antidoping Agency (UKAD).
Following the visit of the Moscow Office of the organization in July, the Director-General of VADA, Olivier Nigley, stated that RUSSADA was " moving in the right direction" to restore its work.
Fire in the 79th floor tower in Dubai
A huge fire that took place in one of the world’s highest housing buildings, the Torch Tower, was collapsed, transmitted by Reuters.
It is noted that firemen have managed to deal with all flames of burning by 4.00 in local time (3.00 MSC).
Local authorities reported that no one was injured as a result of the incident.
During the fire, the streets near the sky were closed.
The reasons for what happened are unknown.
The Torch, one of the highest buildings in the world, was previously reported in Dubai.
All inhabitants were evacuated in time.
Unbelievable Buz's shake of fans: pants without coats
The scandal leading reality show "Home-2" Olga Buzzov hit the spectacles of the European Plus Live festival with the dance in his pants.
In the eyes of thousands of worshippers, the new singer of Nasti Kudra performed the song "We'll be hot."
Both girls came to the scene in provocative pants, sewed in such a way that it appeared to be the lower singing underwear.
The pants were made by the signs of Buzov and Kudry.
It was previously reported that changes in Buzov's appearance were commented by an expert of one of the Moscow plastic surgery clinics.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
On Friday, 4 August, the Radio 4 news service reported with reference to foreign media.
He said that the Russian authorities were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In the interview with CNN, NATO gensek also criticised Russia for the situation with Crime and “destabilization in the east of Ukraine”.
Stoltenberg assured, however, that dialogue with Russia was possible, but the further escalation of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Previously on Thursday, the President of the United States, Donald Tramp, stated that the relations between the United States and Russia were at a dangerous low level, and accused the US Congress.
The Metro of Ekateringburg is a new payment method
In October, a banking map will be paid to the Ekaterinburg Metropolitan, stated by OAO Director Paul Vedernikov in an interview with the District newspaper.
Our goal is to introduce a soccer championship in 2018 the same system as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, New City and Novosiberia.
"We want the guests from other countries, the council guests, to be able to use the metropolitan using their banking maps without acquiring chetons and not standing in a queue," he said.
Startups that will help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to evaluate the level of satisfaction among its e-commerce startup staff, but the surveys were not working.
Answers were often swift, useless, or, worse, unexplicit.
And even though she promised anonymity, some officers did not trust this process.
“He has never been consistent and objective”, said Erett, a 75-person firm of Madison Reed in the area of haircare.
It therefore called for assistance to third persons.
A new type of startpapers in the field of work with personnel is now present to help companies find out how their staff feel.
Developing and licensing the software designed by the measurement of the involvement of staff, they allow companies to make express inquiries, address certain teams and demographic groups, provide staff with anonymity and hot lines for complaints and, in some cases, allow informers to mine top management and direct directives.
"We now have instruments such as Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-osnider and President of the Glint startup from Redwood City, whose analytical programmes are used by companies to measure staff involvement.
Errett said that she had achieved more understanding of what her staff think and feel in three years of use of Glint.
In addition to the express inquiries and surveys of the specific teams, the product offers a warm map of the company and shows in an illustrative form which units have more complaints and which managers have low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
Companies are aware that they need to control the situation in the workplace, or they will become another Uber, who was involved in the scandal when the former officer published a post in the blog in which he described the aggressive situation in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For startups such as Glint, it is a desire to control the situation as an opportunity for profitable business.
According to the Internet portal, let's talk about the payment devoted to financial technologies, the global governance, regulation and conformity industry could cost more than $18.7 billion by 2020.
The Convercent startup of Denver, Colorado, helping companies to prevent and identify bad behaviour, noted a small increase in interest and activities earlier this year in the falling reputation of Uber.
The Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
There has recently been Uber clients.
Like Glint, the Convercent allows companies to send individual staff reviews, collect confidential responses in real-time mode and review the heat maps of the problems zones.
It also provides a hot line for anonymous text messages that allow staff to report bad behaviour.
And if the top manager is touched, the complaints go straight to the directive.
“The Court of Public Review has taken power from the inspectors” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and President of the Convercent company.
If it is clear that the company is treated badly or acts unethically, even if the inspector is not interfered, the company may face expensive consequences in the form of boycotts by clients, the flow of staff and judicial lawsuits, Queenlan reported.
The Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants where more than 25,000 employees work in 500 institutions, used Convercent for over a year to make sure that the staff are aware of the rules and procedures and suggest a simple way to contact the firm's head office.
Earlier, if the staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to search for the phone number or email of the head office, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be serious.
It was often a scary and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, head of the Ruby Tuesday legal administration, saying that there was no normal way to track the complaints.
Now that the company is using the Convercent Service, problems that have previously been hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states, such as discrimination, injustice and unjust pay, can be detected and worked faster.
"I can draw closer to the full, comprehensive understanding of the situation of staff," said Vitrano, who runs the Risk Management Group, Ruby Tuesday.
“And we protect our shareholders from trials with staff.”
According to Quinland, companies began to consider ethics, values and inclusion of staff in 2002, after the accounting company Arthur Andersen had failed because of ethical violations resulting from the Ethic Enron case.
But only when “social networks have received mass dissemination”, companies realized that they would not be able to keep their dirty underwear from viral spread in the network.
“Before the use of technologies to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy” he said.
The Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking a regular wage from companies for their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that has received the approval of venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received funding of $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, resulting in a total capital of $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, resulting in a total capital of $60 million.
These investments are unbelievable if it takes into account the interrelated nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing volume of research shows that today's staff expect more jobs than before.
Markets with severe competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, are just a minimum.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated, and that they devote their time to a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in companies, they feel that they are heard and that the work they do is resulting, they are more trying to make such a company successful,” says Nina McQuin, vice-president for global benefits and satisfying staff in the LinkedIn company where both Convercent and Glint are used.
Investors receive income when businesses from their wallet go well; business is good when the employees are loyal and involved.
If analytical instruments of the third party promise to increase the loyalty and involvement of staff, it is not surprising that they find support.
Cultural experts in the workplace claim that data on staff involvement are important.
But the data is useless until the company's guardians take action.
In fact, if the company asks the staff to reconnect, it can make an impression that changes are heated.
And if the changes do not come fast enough, or do not come at all, there may be disappointment, and the staff will lose interest.
"If you are going to ask for 4000 proposals, you should be ready to hold 4,000 conversations," said Russell Ruth, president of the management company Cotter International, who had to see companies making a mistake, too relying on data collection.
"Why, if you don't go to the end, the staff will think, "Did you hear me?
You don't care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
According to Erett, the Madison Reed company, which is now conducting monthly staff surveys, is able to take action on the same day when someone reports the problem with Glint.
And, after gathering re-connections from staff dissatisfied by decision-making and communication quality, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to address the problems.
The Ruby Tuesday company receives new knowledge of its staff and hopes that in a long-term perspective, these knowledge will help it more effectively maintain staff in the sector known as high-level staffing.
"If you do not try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
If you're losing people, you're losing customers.
And if you're losing customers, you're losing companies.
In Barnaule, a new asfalt is opened in the Red Army Prospectus
In Barnaule, cardinal measures had been taken to address the cause of asphalt failures in the Krasnoarmei Prospectus.
The place where the holes of the newly embedded portion (cross with the Youth Street) were two times raised, is decided to open up.
Recall, a small road site near tramways was disturbed because the land was prosecuted in the area of the unemployed network.
According to the Vice-President of the City Committee on Road Management, Transport and Communications, Ivan Harmat will conduct a detailed survey and elimination of infringements.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected to require reconstruction and concretion of non-house communications.
This is reported on the official country capital website.
The Bryins team has to work longer because the National Student Sports Association has cancelled training twice a day
Time is coming at eleven at night; a crowd of footballists from the University of California in Los Angeles is delayed to talk on one side of the new training fields of the team located on the campus.
Some of them grabbed their shirts, wearing their backs shinying from sweat after the tense day of the sports camp.
For many players, the team's moments are a break in the middle of the day.
The players recorded for summer classes will be sent back to houses after three hours of training to prepare for final examinations and will be returned to the Basserman Football Centre next morning at the 6:30 meeting.
Shortly before Monday turned on Tuesday, the trainer of the team, Bruins Jim Mora, said: “The next three days, these boys are waiting for meat.”
The fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the load for players, actually extended their working day, at least until the examination was completed on Friday.
The first three trainings of the California University team in L.A. were therefore appointed at 7:15 a.m. to put them in and without the dense schedule of the players.
The side effects of the lack of two training daily have increased the number of days with one training, and Bruins moves the start of the camp for almost a week compared to the past year and conducts training during the summer school for the first time in the six seasons of the Sea in Westwood.
According to the schedule, 18 trainings should be conducted by 20 August, inclusively before starting official preparations for the first game in the season against the Texas University A&M in September.
Mora said that it supported the amendment of the rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that there was another item in the dense schedule of the players.
"In three or four days we give them this huge burden, it is a serious test," said Mora.
"And they just overcome it, they work, they're great guys.
I think that when we live before Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
When the camp is completed, the University of California in Los Angeles will take training closed; it is a difficult task because its fields are directly visible from the nearby parking and from the neighbouring Laskin Centre, a expensive hotel, which has already been bombed by footballs over the gate.
The Bruins players should take the hotel from this weekend, but Mora allows that when the rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
“We will have security”, said Mora.
"It's a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger, assuming anyone can take off the room, sit there and record the video training.
If you have a video of training, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security on parking lot 8.
We'll do whatever we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan."
All victims of the terrorist attack in Petersburg are expelled from hospitals
All the victims of the measury in St. Petersburg in April are expelled from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of Vice-Guverner Anna Mitiany.
According to the end of July, three people remained in the stations, transmitted by the TV Centre.
Recall, the explosion in St. Petersburg's metropolitan has passed on on 3 April of the current year.
The bomb was exploded by a terrorist mortal Akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result of the terror, 15 people and the executor were killed.
In the criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov, were arrested.
Recall, before the Rossenger recommended that the metropolitan of Petersburg revise the plan of transport security activities, in particular by increasing the number of metal finders.
Facebook has strengthened the waiting fact in the fight against fake news
Facebook would frequently send texts suspicious of mistifications, independent experts, and show their imprisonment under original posts, said on Thursday the largest social network of the world, which is trying to combat so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to identify possible mixtures, to verify them and perhaps to show the results of the cheking under the original post.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main ways of spreading so-called fake news that many believed that affected the presidential elections of 2016 in the United States.
The issue was also debated actively in Europe after the French voters were misleading false communications before the presidential elections in May, and in Germany, before September's elections, they claimed support for the plan to punish social networks unless they were quickly removing the posts of hatred.
On Thursday, in a separate German statement, Facebook reported the testing of a new fact-cheking algorithm that was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"Besides seeing what communications are disputed by independent checkers, people want to have a broader context in order to make reasonable judgments about what they read and what they share," Sarah Sue, the Facebook news manager, wrote.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the function of " linked articles " and work on other changes in the newsletter to address the problem of fake news.
Create a novel comic book: One castle in English history
In recent times, the Scotty's small castle was taken in the Squeeze music video, and in the 1970s and 80s served as a harbor for Margaret Tatcher.
But 700 years from his comfortable place in the valley of the River, Bull in Kent, he was watching the storm history around, and now he inspired Jamie Rhodes, a yorkshirt with land hair and a tendency to historical documents, to a novel comic book.
"I think it's so beautiful to see a man who died 300 years ago," he said.
"You feel so personal when you hold that letter in your hand."
The Castle in England covers the period from the mid-centuries to the Ewardian age and tells about families living in Scotney; every history is illustrated by one of the young British artists, Isaac Lenkewich, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first Rhodes book based on archive data: in 2014 he wrote " Dead Man Teeth and Other Stories" as a collection of papers from the British Library; this project suddenly touched him to the depth of the soul.
"I could just be scratched by a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in 1700 by a double agent working for Jacobs," he said.
"This is his fingerprint."
And the letters always smell smokes because the lights were fired at the time.
And 300 years later, in the future, you feel like you're there too.
Oh, how I love the archives!"
For a man who is so passionate for old papers, to receive support from the National Fund and the English Arts Council and to live in the castle for four months (“Ferly, I have been a little visited there”), it seems too good to be true.
Rhodes has been studying the new Victorian castle all day, walking through the archives and dealing with many treasures of property and old things -- for example, the heads of hyennes on walls or bottles of centuries.
He walked through the park and on the ruins of the old castle, talking to forestry, gardeners, and sometimes with artists working on the illustrations of his book.
Then at night, he was drinking whiskey and sitting in writing.
The Story of Scotney Castle was not very explored because the National Fund had been fully accessed only in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassie, died.
When Rhodes arrived there ten years later, the staff were just starting to deal with the archive, which he described as “aristocrats have been departing to the shelter for centuries. ”
The journals, the letters of the time of the British Empire, the maps showing who was owned, "You think the land disputes are boring," says Rhodes, but this is what two families were fighting for.
It's happening, guys!"
In some stories, the castle collector becomes a point for broader searches in the English history: for example, in the worker, the hero departs from the building castle to join the Roast Revolution in 1381.
"There is a record of the rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380, a book called "The Knights of Kent and Sussex families," said Rhodes.
"The Christian rebellion began in these places, and I thought the rebellion was the right beginning.
Perhaps they were linked?"
Other stories are closely linked to the history of the castle, for example, the Priest, in which the priest of Jezuite, whom the family of Darrelov had been hiding during the English reformation for seven years.
Or "Contrabandist", about a smuggler of the 18th century, Arthur Darrell, who believed to have instructed his own funeral by loading a trumpet of stones (this was discovered several years later when the grave was dug).
Darrels are the Roads' favorite family of all who inhabited Scotty, "The gentlemen seemed to be a perfect liar, ever in debt and waste money for what they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell's men dealt with their debt problems, marrying rich elderly women - I imagine them as a company of cute boys who can care for the heirs of great states."
After the end of the work at the Rhodes Castle, he is looking for other possibilities to gain unique written experience.
He lived two weeks in the Finnish deaf where he wrote a graphic novel about Elijamjaki, a place where the sanatory was early in the 20th century, and then he grew again in the forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he said.
"I felt like this: Goddamn it, I have to go back to real life again."
Fifteen largest banks are chosen "Russia"
The Russian Bank Association Conflict (ARB) is developing: following Sberk, WTB, WTB-24, Alpha Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhozbank, Binbank and FC Opening, seven other credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, at least 80 per cent of the market will be the share of the NRBs.
However, this is not just an exit -- all banks that have claimed a breakdown with the ARB have negotiated with another public organization which combines credit institutions, the Association of the Regional Banks of Russia, which is headed by the known Politician Anatoli Aksakov, the Chairman of the Committee on the Financial Market, recognized, by the way, by the outcome of the last session and the most effective head of the thought committee and the deputy on the number of drafted laws.
The beginning of the conflict within the AARB was held during a discussion in the Council of the Federation when new laws, interregional banking Council, were addressed, inter alia, to provide for a new classification of banks depending on the size of the statutory capital.
At that time, Garegin Tosunjan, President of the AAR, said that, in the opinion of the Association, the biggest banks had been adopted, which thus attempted to limit the possibility of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by capturing their clientship.
Among other claims was also the criticism of the Central Bank, which, in the view of Tosunjana, did not always justify the license of certain banks, which, indeed, followed the objection by the representative of the BC: many of the banks who had been injured, in particular the External Prombank, were involved in the ARB management bodies.
Apparently, this exchange of inter-exclusive views in a very sensitive relationship with the principal banking regulator and has become a visible reason for the 15 largest banks, with a statement of disagreement with the ARB policy, began preparing to enter the Association of Russia, noting that the " Efficiency of the ARB work would be at a low level and the constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually being implemented."
The cartridges will be better
What's the end of this?
Answer immediately the main question that arises at the smallest conflict or in a banking sphere or near: nothing threatens the investors, rather, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Heads the "Russia" Anatoli Aksakov, known as vaccine in all the interests of banks and their clients, high-level profession, which is highly appreciated in the Central Bank: almost all BC leadership is present in annual association activities, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator ' s regulator are carried out through expert assessments of "regionals".
In the staff-organization plan, there are obviously no special shocks.
Certainly, the ARB is in a difficult financial and management situation after such powerful and influenced participants with their contributions and lobbys.
However, in 1991, the senior, which was established, the banking community ' s interests, has no potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the scope of monetary credit.
It is not possible to say that in the Russian Association with widespread arms, they are ready to accept under any conditions of the new members, according to the reaction of its manager, Anatolia Aksakov ("may be too desirable"), which was still on 21 July at a briefing in the press centre of the Parliamentary newspaper, said that " literally the representatives of the banks left the ARB have asked me to consider the possibility of increasing the capacity of our Association " Rosie " .
Their proposals are to strengthen the vote of bankers in the Association Council and to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiating process, the proposals of both parties are being examined, the agenda for an extraordinary assembly of the association that will take place in Sochi in the middle of September under the international banking forum.
That's where we'll be determined.
Furthermore, Anatolius Aksakov, emphasizing that “does not hold for the chair”, referred to the potential new leader of the updated Association, Georgi Luntovski, who departs from the position of the Vice-Chairman of the Central Bank in September, highly characterized by his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatolius Aksakov, who now rests in Crime, planned to interrupt and arrive in Moscow for an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association of Russia, where it was intended to consider the agenda for the extraordinary meeting of the “Russia”.
The entrance of gas engines into large Russian cities will not be limited
The Deputy Head of Mintrans, Nicolai Asaul, stated that, contrary to the media, the entrance of vehicles with gas engines to the large towns of Russia is not limited.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually increase the environmental class.
And there's the concept to go to zero emissions immediately.
I don't think we're technically ready for this.
The question is, from what year?
It's a sloung-level phrase, let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Are we closing the whole town?
"In 20 years, I don't know, maybe that's what's going to happen," says Prime of the minister's words.
Previously, the report reported that by 17 August, Vice-Prime Minister Arkadia Dvorkovic was assigned to explore the proposals for the possible options of the electric transport household submitted to the Government by the PAO CAZ Director Sergei Kogogini.
Among the proposals, newspapers are the use of VAT vehicles in large cities and in the resorts.
Washington is changing the Greencard rules.
According to the media, President Donald Tramp said that a new US immigration plan would be adopted, changing the rules of acquisition of the Greencard.
The plan provides for reducing the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, more strictly receiving temporary visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in the two Congress Chambers.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase the salary and savings to taxpayers billions of dollars, and will make it possible to change the way the United States is providing fundcards to other nationals.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide advantages to candidates who own English have money that allow them to contain themselves and have skills that will benefit our economy," Tramp said, according to the American media.
Sex robots' appearance is real, and it should be anxious for us.
We failed to think that 2017 could not be worse, a new report on technological progress in the production of sexual robots.
Yeah.
Sex robots are now in the center of attention.
The Responsible Robot Technical Fund (FRR) recently issued a report on the development of sexual robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharky, the earned professor of robotics and artificial intelligence of the University of Chieffield and the FRR co-osnitor, we must consider their appearance seriously.
The users will be able to choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the boots and the type of nails.
"People are chishing about this, but companies are already sending them to consumers, and we will soon see them much more," Sharky said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their industrial communities in robots with a silicone skin warm and with almost human replicas managed by artificial intelligence.
Users can also set their robots on their own taste by choosing everything from the color of their eyes and the form of boots to the shape and color of their nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "personality" compared to which the Stepford woman would seem very progressive is even more concerned.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot company allows users to adjust the quality of robots that they find attractive, for example, shameful.
There are still Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by the True Companion, which are delivered with already programmed individuality -- for example, Cold Farra makes an impression of embarrassing, and "Diaka Wendy" has a "brain" character.
"Roxxxy Gold has a nature that is beautiful for you," says the True Companion website.
So she loves what you love, and does not love what you don't love, and so on.
She's changing her mood during the day, like a real man!
She can want to sleep or talk, or she can be in the mood!
In the appearance of sexual robots, a lot of concerns is not in the latest because they replace real human relationships, but the most concerns the subjection of a woman, the association with rape that causes the sustainability of the Cold (read: Resistant) of Faroe.
Roxxxy is compared to a vibrator only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) has a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?", says the website.
But these sex robots are not just fetishi or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, departing from the ideal of gender equality to the desire of sex with subjection as an optional addendum.
Most men will, of course, not buy sex robots, and although the FRR marks their growing popularity, they remain on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery may be very instructive about the meaning of the age in which we live.
And many people are not stupid or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
This is not a coincidence - that these complex sex robots appeared just when the rights of women around the world were threatened when the president was in the White House, who praised by the adherence to women.
The most scary thing in the "Rassca servant" television is not graphic images, sloppy bodies and smashed eyes, exactly how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is overwhelming, but now it doesn't seem so big.
The purpose of the sexual robot industry is to acquire such physically similarity to real women (only with proportion of porn stars), which technology allows.
Their creators want them to look like humans to copy the movements of the human body.
But they're not like real women in their characteristics.
They can't break up with their partners or leave them.
They have no life, no biography -- nothing that could point to independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of full dependency.
In other words, these are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, the servants.
The harvester of L.A. Eugene (Puh) Jetter, speaking for Ukraine's assembly since 2013, will not help our national team at the basketball championship of Europe, whose final part is launched on 31 August.
The BeBasket portal was interviewed by the general manager of the " blue-yellow" Andrey Leбедev.
We tried to deal with Jetter, but unfortunately he would not come under family circumstances.
We're going to Eurobasket without a naturalized player because we don't want to get someone we don't know.
"It will give us the opportunity to develop our young players," he said.
Recall, when Jether was directly involved, the Ukraine's collection took a record sixth place in Eurobasket-2013 and first arrived at the world's basketball championship, where the Yellow-Blue was unable to overcome the group stage, and the US crop collected 15.4 points in the average, made three selections and gave 5 transfers.
Jetter has stopped speaking for Ukraine's assembly since he left the Chief Coach of our National Team, American Mike Fratello, who left this post in 2015.
The Europeanbasket-2017 male will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will take its team tournament on the Promised Earth.
In Group B, there will be five fights in Eugenia Murzin: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3th), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our male assembly conducted two controls in which the Dutches and Belarus were departed.
Big Tramp's struggle?
Seems very reasonable to be Mita Romney.
In the Trampa era, the fact was that some families broke on the micro-level of the American Electorate political disputes.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers posted columns about how to deal with horrible relatives voted for Tramp.
Looks like we're all so tense that we're gonna blow up soon.
They say less about Tramp's ability to connect families.
I write about it because my cousin, my left views of a poet from Chicago, who was on the knives with the Republicans in her family, came to New York this week.
She reminded me that the union in the fight against the common enemy could have a strong effect.
With Tramp in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother, with whom she had been arguing about the policy for decades, suddenly and strangely argued on the same side.
At dinner, it is certainly good; but I can't help thinking that in a broader context, it could be quite dangerous.
Tramp inhaled forces in the left flag, but the deforming effect of his rule could move us all to the right.
When we're talking about Tramp and "normalization", we mean a little possibly a chance that one day we're going to stop surprising his excellence.
However, there is a more doubtful scenario in which Tramp "normalizes" the rightest republicans, who will suddenly show their standards as a model of healthy sense.
I found myself very missed today the old-fashioned mitta Romney's madness -- with a dog on the car roof and a 14-percent tax tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looks) -- compared to Tramp and that, and the other seemed very small.
When Tramp leaves, the next candidate of the Republic will just be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids on a carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel in the Department of Parks in New York, and the best way to spend three dollars in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The lobsters are terrifying and huge, pictures of glasswake on the central drums -- clowns and animals, which, eagerly, look at their backs, are extremely creepy, and the sounding music, as strange, is admiring.
So many of the known things in this city are disappointed that the species from the sky are getting old, the forces of buildings have been too far to embarrass, and the reality of the city does not succeed in dreams.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still worried about the day when I found out that the Suiss Cottage area is actually not a Swiss Shale (Ye Olde Swiss Cottage) but a large circuit crossing in North London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magic place where a child is two years old, an eleven-year child and two women in forty can have a great time.
If I could evaluate the carousels, I would have put a five, but fortunately, no one asked me for that.
And in the university this week, I was asked before a terminal card, to evaluate my "experience" scope from one to five stars.
In the café on the corner of my street, the same thing plus the option to accompany the tea assessment at 15 per cent is a standing order.
As a result, neutral interaction is not only delayed on the idea, but also had to make personal relations in a situation that did not imply it.
The poor seller in the university was smiling confused while I was tired of evaluating my experience in handling her credit card in five stars.
Oscar Pystorus was transferred from prison to hospital because of breast diseases
Pystorus leaves prison for visiting a doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of wrist cuts, which, according to the prison administration, he received as a result of a fall in the cell.
The Pystorus was convicted of a deliberate murder after the appeal of the prosecutor to the initial sentence of unintended murder.
He killed Steencamp early in the morning of the Valentine Day in 2013, shooting several times through the door of the bathroom room in his house in Pretoria.
Pystorus stated that he accepted his friend as a night thief who was hiding in his bathroom.
The Prosecutor stated that the intention of making another protest was, this time, against the six-year period of Pretorius, which, she said, was too soft.
The General Prosecutor stated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that appeal would be considered this year.
The pretorius period may increase by 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The suspect of a NTV reporter was elected a non-exit subscription
The capital lawguards have chosen a measure of interruption as a subscription for a man who had attacked the NTV television journalist Nikita Razvozeva during the direct eter from the Gorky Park on 2 August.
TACS reported this with reference to the official representative of IRD, Irine Wolk.
“In the framework of the investigation of a criminal case imposed on page 116 of the RCF as a 32-year-old man who had been hit by a correspondent in the Central Cultural Park and a rest of the name of Gorky, the suspect is a suspected interruption in the form of a subscription for non-exit and proper behaviour”, said the Wolk.
The representative of the IMD added that the suspect had a administrative protocol for non-compliance with the police.
On Wednesday, 2 August, during the direct e-mail to the WAT Day, a strict man approached the correspondent and hit the face.
Later it appeared that the huligan had nothing to do with VAT.
According to Ravozjaev, the desanters, on the contrary, tried to hold the Moscow.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for an illegal parliamentary park
According to the B-T-Vi television, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for an illegal chamber parking.
On 1 August, a group of people who placed tents in an unnecessary place was detained in Sitonia, including two Bulgarian citizens.
They were released on the same day, while the consequence was still under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the B-T-Vi television that Bulgarian citizens were later released.
The Greek authorities have strengthened the control of free camping and have already given serious fines to all who have been caught during the parking site not intended for this place.
Checks will be conducted throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may appoint a fine.
MID of Russia accused US Vice-President of the rhetoric of the time of cold war
Statements made during the European Vice-President of the United States, Michael Pens, were criticized by the Russian MIDA.
"It is regrettable that Washington is increasingly inclined to the primitive ideological prints of the cold wartime, which are completely distracted from reality," the Russian Foreign Political Authority said.
Thus, in the MIDE, Pens had responded to the words of the “Russian threat” and the attempts of the violent crossing of the borders he said in Podgorica.
The Russian MID indicated the destructiveness of the election " either with the West or with Russia " and the invisibleness of the thysis of the alleged non-alternate entry of the entire South-Eastern Europe to NATO.
Russian diplomats also reminded that the United States had violated international law by applying the force to dismissal Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another tension.
“We call upon American colleagues to stop the rushing and its external policy line, which is consistently based on respect for partners and willingness to jointly constructive work, on mutual learning of interests,” said the Russian MIDA statement.
Feldsher was injured in the DTP with "speed" in Podmoskovje
The DTP took place in the Stupino submoscional, which resulted in a collaboration with the Emergency Carrier.
Today, around 08:10 MsC, the Mitsubishi car crashed with ambulance in the city of Stupino of Moscow.
" As a result of the collaboration, the " rapid" machine has reversed," TASS said in the press service of the IMD GU on the Moscow area.
Law enforcement officers are working at the PTP site, and the circumstances of the occurrence are detected.
In the area of Odessa, the woman threw her newborn son into a celophane package.
In the evening of 3 August, the Division Division of the Police received a message from the local inhabitant that he found a package with a baby in an unconstructed private house.
"The law guards and physicians who have carried the child to the medical agency have gone to the scene of the incident," reported the head of the National Police in Odessa.
Medicines found that the boy was born a few hours before he was discovered, as evidenced by the existence of the puppy.
During the first-row operational activities, the identity of the child is the 36-year-old local inhabitant.
It is also established that the woman has three other minor children.
As noted in the head, in the field of law enforcement, the family had not previously arrived and had not been taken into account.
The police are currently setting out the circumstances and reasons that offered the woman to do this, and the processing decision will be taken.
The baby is now under the surveillance of the doctors.
As reported earlier, a 21-year-old woman threw her child into a trash.
Gregory Leps: "I'm fighting, though 55 is not 30."
One of the most successful Russian estrade, Gregory Leps, will celebrate his 55th year in the next Sunday.
Before the feast, the singer had a conversation with the "Information" observer.
I remember your "package" marking.
The special tent in the Lowers, Gloria Gaynor sang for the namer, a strong salute over the Moscow River.
You must have pretended to spend your next five-year-old.
Did the intentions come true?
Speaking of profession, it was a good time.
I've worked a lot, I've driven the whole country three times, giving 120 to 30 concerts a year.
I've released two good albums.
Of course, now I'm not the one that, we say, 20 years ago.
The biological clock won't lie.
Singing like I sang in my 30, it's getting harder.
Still, I'm fighting, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going to a different level.
You're writing a new album with them, first in three years.
Yeah, it's working on.
In fact, we've already recorded everything in my studio and now we'll send it to Los Angeles.
It's called "Why are you so serious?" by a one-name song that was written together with Timati.
She's not ready yet, so we haven't given her anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we take the video on it.
And let's present the album in November, to my series of anniversary concerts in Moscow's Crocus City Hall.
Your new plastic was handed by a great American drumboy Chris Coleman.
You seem to want to get him into your gastrointestinal?
I think Coleman is one of the most excellent drummers in the world today.
He came to my studio, recorded his parties.
I offered him to join my group, and Jeremy Coulson (the famous drumman participating in various projects. - Notifications) proposed.
But for the continuing work in Russia, they had, eagerly speaking, excessive conditions.
It was about $35,000 to $45,000 a month.
Then I thought that in the post-soviet space, I would find worthy musicians.
And he found a great drumboy Max Malichev.
In fact, it is better to feed yourselves.
Sometimes I want to get to one of them, not for what.
For example, the guitarist Fedor Dosumov is high at the international level.
It is written by Western musical magazines, invited to a variety of guitar festivals.
Steve Vaj, listening to his game, said that "new generation of guitars, with another executive technique."
Your album is in Los Angeles, the American musicians cooperate with you, but you still can't come to the United States?
Are you trying to remove that ban?
Now, honestly, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I really regret I can't get to America.
I've told you I've been studying there.
The more you communicate with these professionals, the more helpful.
We're not stupider than them, but we don't have that experience, school.
Our executives of popular music for 70 years did not have the tasks that American musicians had always decided.
They seek to make the sound of the highest quality.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, Britain has refused to enter me for ten years.
But I'm still going to put visa documents to the British embassy every year so I can be allowed to ride there again and the most important thing is to work there.
The rest of Europe treats me favorably.
And in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not a procurement, but an awesome, right?
Yeah, there's a good Sporting Hall in Monte Carlo, I've spoken there once.
Now they were invited again, and as far as I know, all the tickets for the concert have already been sold.
You're going to the Lima Vicula Rande, which starts on July 20, you're going to go?
She invited me, and I, of course, responded.
Lyma is a wonderful singer and a wonderful woman who knows how to put herself in a beautiful vocal, even whisper.
After the auspices and the anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you're looking at the creativity of Vladimir High.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discograph.
When's the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But it'll be completely different.
I want to write some of the 80-90 songs of the High One in the same file as he did.
Only the voice and the guitar.
No other arrangements.
I'll be composed of our famous musician Timor Vedernikov.
I'll try to get involved in the album and Alexandr Jakub Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about this, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy person, so let's see how it works.
You and the songs of Boris Grebenschikov gradually put into your repertoire.
Why don't you write his stuff later?
Boris Borisovic is a beautiful man and a great musician.
I intersected with him a few times, and I asked, "Can I sing a song or a song?"
He said, "Gregor, I'm writing songs to be fulfilled."
Please try, sing.
I guess it's interesting to write a album like that.
I don't have this task yet, but in the future, a year or two, if Boris Borisovic doesn't object, I might do a project like that.
If you don't focus completely on your manufacturer's business.
I guess until you've realized his potential, you haven't signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers I wished to have under my wing, but they were self-related people.
Do you understand Sergei Lazarev?
Sergeja is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may disagree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and has his development strategy.
And now, in my center, there's Alexander Panayot, whom I used to run in the Voice.
We've made a deal and we're working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It will be truly pity if he does not reach the heights that are worthy.
I'm trying to pick him up a repertoire, take off the videos.
I hope it's a good result.
I also try to promote other artists in my centre: I buy them songs, cry to poets, sometimes their tracks are in the rotation of television and radio channels.
If they do not achieve large heights, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
At the exit, they'll get a recorded album, a few videos.
And then, if they want, they can go their way, and I will not insist that they return the money they invest in them.
Although I would be pleased if one of them had a commercial success and paid me for the interests we agreed on in the contract.
But if it doesn't happen, I'm not going to cover anyone's oxygen.
Let everyone work, try, prove, like I once proved.
If you'll be offered tomorrow to take a tour to Ukraine and guarantee entering the country, will you?
I'm still being invited there.
This is mainly about closed activities.
What about the big trip...
I am a man of my country, a Russian man, on my own conviction, flying to Syria on the same plane that then broke down.
If they say tomorrow that we have to fly to some other point for the State, I will go.
And I don't care what bloggers and other criticism will think about me.
I am sincerely sorry that this situation has been done with Ukraine.
Because I think we are one nation and we must be together.
I'm sorry that that's not gonna happen, at least in the nearest time.
I used to give 40-50 concerts in Ukraine for a year.
They met like nowhere.
Very grateful audience.
And he cooperated with several Ukrainian artists, Annie Lorak, Saint Loboda, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine, a mass of gifted people, and sincerely, they can't fully tap their talent to the broad Russian audience.
Music should combine and entertain people.
I would like to invite a classic Ukrainian performer to Russia, such as Slava Vakarchuk, and make a joint concert with him.
But I don't think so.
Andrea Oclopkov was transferred from cosmodroma
As known as "Y", the Technical Director of the Eastern Andrej Ohlopkov began to work at the State Space-Scientific-Producing Centre (NPC) named Chronicheva.
In fact, he had worked on the construction of the Eastern cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the management of the Land and Space Infrastructure Centre (CENCY) was transferred to the company in Moscow Philles, where it would coordinate production.
Mr. Oclopkov will not have a exchanger: the technical director will probably be emptied, and the functional will be discharged by CENCY units.
The fact that the Technical Director of the Eastern Director and Deputy Director of the CENC on Technology Development, Andrej Ochlopkov, was transferred to work at the HRKPC named Chruničeva, " E" told the top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as a government apparatus officer.
"He's been working on a new post for a few weeks," affirmed the interviewers "Y" in the sector.
Receiving the operational comment of CENKI failed on Thursday, and Mr. Hlopkov himself was not available for comments.
However, the information “E” was formally confirmed in the GNPC.
He decided to move to the headquarters of the Director for Coordination of Manufacturing, " said to the enterprises. " Andrej Hlopkov had completed the task of the starting minimum for the first launch in the Eastern cosmodrome.
Mr. Ohlopkov went to work at CENKI in 2013, having a space troop service, in particular in Baiconure, and in Plesecka, at the northern cosmodrome, took the first commander of the Colonel.
In 2009, Andrej Hloppkov became a criminal figure.
The investigation accused him of bribery: it appears that the regional commercials were receiving orders for dismissal, but did not fulfil the obligations made to clean up separated parts of archangel missiles in the region and the Republic of the Comi.
In 2012, the jury court declared him innocent.
The tasks of technological development in the SENCE were allocated to various projects, but the main part of them was the construction of cosmodroma in the Far East.
The head of the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Stapenko, in the interview with the " E", directly said that the situation in the East was "critical in October 2013".
The point is that a strategic error was made in planning: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Union-2.1 missile was planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
For the end of the year, the completion of the construction was decided six months earlier, and the periods were placed from December to July 2015.
In order to accelerate the process, TENKI experts began a parallel installation of technological equipment on unconstructed facilities.
The main part of this idea was Andrej Klopkov.
Despite the existing risks and yet the existing transfer (instead of December 2015, the Union flew only on 28 April 2016), the idea justified itself, said the source of "Y" on the cosmodrome: "If we would have not yet performed any rifle from the Eastern, but we would have been building."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitri Rogozin, who was cosmodroma-contributing, jokefully called Andrea Olopkov his " space Susanini", but he almost always asked for information on the construction.
He remembered Mr. Ohlopkov and the directness: for example, he proposed that the Federal Special Building Agency (Specstra) be deprived of the status of the only executive on the East and directly working with the subcontractors: " Why should we all have to put eggs in the same specimen?"
This idea found support in the Government.
Since 2017, CENKI has undertaken a general contractor to complete construction and construction work at the starting and technical complex to the fourth quarter of the launch.
According to Mr. Oclopkov, the disagreements with the CENCI on how to complement the construction of buildings and cosmodroma complexes, as well as the methods of working with subcontracting organizations have been caused to move Mr. Oclopkov into the new place of work.
"It was decided to be best for everyone," said one of the top managers involved in the Eastern elevation.
The Government's worker, in turn, calls the decision strange: " He was one of the best experts, finding an equal replacement would be difficult."
According to " E", this would not be necessary: the post of the technical Director of Cosmodroma will be empowered and its functions will be discharged by CENCY units.
A two-specific training programme will be available in musical schools
In the future, children's music schools will be able to receive two specialities at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Ministry of Science and Education, the Ministry of Science and Education of Sacred Slavoslava Pigeon can be re-readed to students with renewable disciplines, and the issue with the rest of the second classes to decide through special grants, the RIA News transmits.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue into control, and we and the expert community will develop a mechanism that will allow two specialities to be acquired but will not contradict the current educational legislation," said Pigeonko.
Last Friday, during the Nedie Talk, Vladimir Putin and the Child Centre of Syrius, student Maria Andreeva, reported that she was forced to pay repetitive items on second specialty in the CMS at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told me she was learning violin and piano class and has awards for both directions.
The head of the State recognized its question very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russian detained on the sky wall
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian Cyrille N., who climbed on the roof of the high building, reported the El Universal portal.
The incident occurred in the capital of Mexico.
With the help of two unknown men, he crossed a three-foot fence to the territory of the Nestle office building complex and self-closed into one of his towers.
He did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
The young man's been held on the roof.
Officers of the Ministry of Public Security put him on the ground on a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute for Migration.
It determines whether the young man is legally in the territory of the country.
Meanwhile, the video with a young man who is on the highest level has become popular in the Network.
The users called the young man a spider man.
According to the media, such experiments are hobby for him.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate can help to facilitate the HCC.
Red meat and chocolate is considered a nightmare for your food tract.
Recent studies, however, refer to the reverse: diet, rich in meat proteins and breast products, can help to facilitate symptoms of those who suffer from inflammatory diseases.
This incurable illness, which affects approximately 1.3 million people in the United States and 30,000 in Britain, leads to the quantities and abdominal elevatation, chronic or bloody pride, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
Usually, for the mitigation of symptoms, it is advised to avoid meat and milk products, but researchers at the University of Washington found that the main protein amino acid triptophane contributes to the production of immune cells that increase the tolerance of the wheat.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells in the womb are looking to ensure that harmful microbes that come from food are not infiltrated into the body.
The cells capable of launching the inflammatory process are balanced with cells that increase tolerance by protecting the body and not harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too severely disturbed to the inflammation, it may lead to inflammatory diseases of the wormhole.
Experiments have shown that mice with a certain bacteria in the worm have increased tolerance of cells.
And this bacteria needs triptophane, one of the protein construction elements, to start the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We have established a connection between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is part of the normal intestinal microbiom and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more triptophane was contained in the feeding of mouses, the more these immune cells they had."
He assumed that the same would work with people: combining L. reuteri and a rich triptophane diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less aimed at inflammation in the womb.
Dr. Louisa Servantes-Barraganwas, in studying the variety of increases in immune cell tolerance, found that one mice group had these cells, and another group that belonged to the same line but was separately not.
She assumed that the difference could be caused by the microbioms of the mixture of the mouse - communities of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms, which usually live in a stomach tract.
The DNA of the worm cells of the mouse were sequented and six types of bacteria were discovered in mouses with immune cells but lacked by mice without them.
The mouses raised in a sterile environment without a good microbiom and that have not developed this type of immune cells received L. reuteri, and their immune cells appeared.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers raised L. reuteri in the liquid environment and then transferred a small variety of liquid, without bacteria, to undepleted immune cells allocated from the mouse.
Immune cells have become tolerant cells.
When the active component was separated from liquid, it was an side product of tripthane processing known as indol-3 milk acid.
When the researchers doubled the number of mice tripthane, the number of these cells increased by approximately 50 per cent, but when the triptophane level was doubled, the number of cells also fell twice.
Dr. Servantes-Barragan explains that people have the same increased tolerance of the cells as the mouse, and most of us have L. reuteri in their stomach tract.
It is unknown whether the L. reuteri adverse products of the L. cell development have been contributed to humans as with mouses, but people suffering from inflammatory diseases have been detected in triptophane genes.
She says, "Maybe the development of these cells should be strengthened, as these cells depend on the inflammatory processes on the internal surface of the wombs.
The high levels of tripthane, if there is L. reuteri, may potentially lead to the promotion of their population."
In the opinion of Jose Maurynius, Manchester UNITED hired “geny ” in the face of Nemanji Matich
“Manchester UNITED” hired “geny” in the face of Nimania Matich, considering Jose Maurynius after the semi-protector debutted at the game against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
The player, acquired for 40 million pounds from Chelsea, began with the winning of 2-1 in Dublin in the last pre-season UNAIDs game in front of the UEFA Supercube game against Real Madrid on Thursday, and impressed the role of a semi-protector, while players like Pogba and Andreas Pereira broke forward when they were welcomed.
However, since Matic did not participate in the Chelsea pre-season tour in Asia, he was seriously lacking training for the game, and he had lasted only 45 minutes, which Maureeny said to require refreshment before the start of the Prime Minister Liga season.
"He needs time, but his experience, the genius of his thinking - he thinks football," said Maureen.
“We will help him prepare sooner than later.”
Just like Matic, his new players Victor Lindelof and Romelo Lukak started a game at the Aviva stadium when Maureenew started forming his main composition to the beginning of the next season.
The Independent newspaper reported this week that Maureenou wanted to hire three more players, but emphasized that the club had already achieved fantastic results, hiring three of the four players he wanted to hire first.
“I am grateful to the club for gaining three of the four," he added.
"I will be more pleased if they get me four out of four, but they have already made a great effort for me."
Former Leaders of Democratic Socio-Democrats of Lithuania instruct them to remain in the ruling coalition
Former Presidents of the Lithuania Social Democratic Party, the former Prime Ministers of Algirdas Butkavicus and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former speaker of the Chaos Yurschenas Social Social Social Seam, called on the uniparts to remain in the ruling coalition.
According to the Parliamentary newspaper, a discussion was initiated in the Social Democratic Party because of the coalition with the partners, the Union of Agriculture and Greens, whether it should remain in the ruling coalition.
And three senior experienced companions called on the unilaterals with an open letter, which, in particular, states: "The disappointment of the electoral companions is understood, but the coalition with the " christians" has created for us not very light but still the conditions for further implementation of the objectives of social justice, which, on our initiative, are envisaged in the Government's programme and to maintain the political domination of the left centre over the right parties."
According to the former leaders of the Party, the discussion has yet “reasoned the expression based on emotions without concrete arguments”.
The authors of the letter fear that their party could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Anthony Mamaev's disabilities have been sentenced.
Mosgorsud mitigated the penalty of an invalid carrier, Anton Mamaev, from four and a half years of imprisonment to a fine of 200,000.
A convict was previously released from the SISO by the Timirazev Court.
Mosgorsud, however, confirmed that the defendant was a criminal because he organized the breakdown and kidnapping of a motorcycler from the former specialist.
Mosgorud made his decision to mitigate the penalty of Anton Mamaev to 200,000.
"Mamaev is a organizer of fraud, which also forms a crime and, respectively, such a person must be brought to criminal responsibility," explained the press secretary of Mosgorsud Ulijan Solopov.
In this case, the court took into account the condition of Mamaev’s health, the actual circumstances, the lack of difficult circumstances.
Furthermore, the court has applied p. 64 of the PF, which means the punishment of a lower range.
With regard to the Assistant of Mamaev Vasili Serostanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would be the basis for changing the weight of the conviction.
Anton Mamaev himself stated that he remained disappointed in the decision of Mosgorsud.
I'm disappointed in the court's decision.
The only legal solution would be the excuse, aimed at further fighting for justice.
His lawyer, Andrej Orlov, did not exclude the conviction of the mosgorsud and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the leverages to the European Court of Human Rights," he said, "RIA News".
Recall, the 28-year-old Moscow Anton Mamaev, who suffered from the back muscle atrophia, became a criminal figure last autumn.
Invalid claims that he bought a motorcycler from a familiar person for 160,000 bucks to sell.
However, the owners of the engineer, among whom the former specialist, stated that the disabilities and his assistant, Vasilij Serotanov, had taken their property, threatening to apply violence.
On 30 June, the Moscow District Court sentenced Vasilia Serosztanova to the three years of colony, and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years of imprisonment in the general regime colony (a.k.a. 162 PCF).
Once the disabilities were placed in the SISO, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor of Human Rights, was joined in the case of President Tatian Moscalkov.
As a result, in the middle of July, Anton Mamaev was released from the SIS by the same Timirazev Court.
The defence, in turn, opposed the decision of the first instance in Mosgorud.

According to the Notifications, the UNF outcome forum will take place in the autumn.
The exact date of its conduct has not yet been determined, generally, under the president's schedule, who is a leader of the movement and traditionally presents key activities of UNFC.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, on one by two federal districts, in Rostow Na-Don, Kaliningrad and Kira.
The outcome will be a conference in the capital of the Republic of Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals expressed and expressed in these activities, we will set up systemic proposals for environmental problems,” said the UNFC's interviewer.

In particular, the Chairman was asked about the waste dump in Balash (only closed) and the coal dust in the port of Nayka (the law on the prohibition of the open coal transparency in the settlements, one of the authors, Olga Timothyva).
Eco-economic experts believe that the legal framework for solutions to environmental problems in Russia is generally established, the issue is further law enforcement and civil society position.

The member of the SME, head of the non-governmental organization of the Greenpeace of Russia, Sergei Chiplenkov, emphasized that the successful solution to environmental problems requires a responsible approach to society and business, a few legislative efforts.

The expert emphasized that the trend to breach environmental legislation was a economicly profitable solution for business.
The British inventor used a microchip to get into the house and the car with his hands
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be established by a microchip so that he could open the door of his house, enter the office and even drive a car with a simple handwriting.
The thirty-year-old Steven Northam has made a small chip between the big and pointing fingers and now offers this service to companies and private persons who want to simplify their life on account of technology.
He joined Dr. Jeff Watson, anesthesiologist from the Royal Consultant in Winchester, in order to ensure that the application procedure is carried out in accordance with medical standards.
Technology is like a microchip that uses cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The Nortem company also replaces locks in houses and cars compatible with a $300 pound chip for one castle.
One child's married father has already established technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which works when his hand is on the wheel.
Requisition for the White House cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
According to the records of the armed forces provided by the TIME magazine, the decision of the White House last month was to bring a helicopter to the Southern Seafoot to the event devoted to American industrial production, worth $24,000 taxpayers.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, became the central element of the event held on 17 July in the White House of Constructions, on which the American Building Programmes were demonstrated.
President Donald Tramp, Vice-President Mike Pens and Higher White House officials examined the technological products of all fifty states.
The helicopter made in Connecticut was exhibited next to the ship from the state of Man, a fire car from Wisconsin and a car loader from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Squadry of the Sea Marines (HMX-1), the Department responsible for the management of the helicopter, the White House military headquarters ordered the presence of a helicopter in private order, or “FRAGO”, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the Southern loaf on the event of the “unusual” event.
"I just wanted you to make sure that you know, because this is an unusual event in the press," said commander HMX-1 in his e-mail to the Chief, the first deputy chief of the marine corps, before the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Railroad at approximately 7 a.m. on 17 July to participate in the 3 p.m. event, and would remain there before the gasoline was released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, the second crew will be required to fly back in accordance with hours limitations.
The first crew was accompanied by a helicopter during the event, and the security officers remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records received by the TIME magazine, it remains clear whether the second crew was required.
Hetch's law prohibits federal officials to use public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 has defined whether the action was contrary to this provision.
"We have asked, among other things, whether this is a violation of the Hatch law, and they have replied to us that it is not," said the commander.
"Sounds like you have nowhere to go," said the Deputy Chief.
The event was declared White House as an official event, and the Hatch law was not distributed to it.
But even official activities have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to promote the reform of health reforms that had been developed at the time in the Senate, and commended the attempts to regulate government decisions.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
The presidents are prescribed to use them for travel.
But it is unusual to ask them for photos only.
Tramp was already the subject of discussions in February when the presidential plane went back during its first pre-electoral meeting in Melbourne, Florida, and his account in Twitter was charged with complaints on the use of his precedent.
“The White House is admired by the presentation of “Made in America”, which represented products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials,” said the Deputy Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews are frequently operating training flights around the Washington Aglomeration and on the South Ridge to train the transport of President of the United States to the White House with precisely to inch.
When Tramp was at the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 held 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight carried out for America ' s activities was estimated on the necessary training flights per month.
Helicopters also flew 11 additional hours on the " non-Presidential support tasks " on that day.
According to the White House, taxpayers had no expenses for any of the other exhibitions presented at the events.
The representative of the Sikorsky said that the company had not participated in a demonstration of the helicopter in the Southern Lodge.
HMX-1 does not take into account the budget for presidential flights and determine the exact amount spent on the event is difficult.
However, according to the time rates of the Ministry of Defence for 2017, the VH-3D reimbursement rate is $24,380 per hour of flight.
The records indicate that the aircraft time was 30 minutes on each side of its airport based on the aviation base of the Quantico marine in Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual value of the use of the helicopter is much below this rate.
“Calculate the value for taxpayers, based on the sample rate of reimbursement, is absolutely wrong,” said Walters.
“These example rates include the personal composition, service and many other non-return costs that are included in annual appropriations.”
According to the study conducted by the RAND Corporation in 2015, the reimbursement rates do not include the value of the personal composition, but, indeed, take into account the value of fuel, service and costs set out in the treaty.
At that time, the former Press Secretary of the White House, Sean Spiser, spoke to protect the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to show the things that were done in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security and that they exist, I assume, hundreds, if not thousands of people whose jobs are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and another military technology that has been working hard on the creation of so many Americans.
Therefore, it is perfectly appropriate to pay attention to it."
It was irregular whether Tramp was interacting with the helicopter by looking at the South Railway during the event, but he was definitely sitting in the driver's place in the fire car.
Inside the White House, Tramp addressed the representatives of the Sikorsky company, joking about the press on its own fleet of the company's products.
"I know Sykorsky well," said the President. "I have three of them."

Energy is cheaper for both the inhabitants and for the producers of the goods of Burjatia

The Federal Anti-Monopolity Service of the country, in accordance with the Rules of the Rules of the Rules of the Rules of Amendment to the Optional Market of Electric Energy and Power and the consolidated projection balance of production and electricity supplies (power) in the framework of the Uni Energy System on the subjects of the Russian Federation (from 17.07.2017 No. 842), established indications on electricity and power for industrial consumers in the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the value of electricity for the buryat producers is reduced by a quarter, which will significantly make life easier for small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For decades, the leaders of the Republic have been robbing the thresholds of the Moscow offices in degraded attempts to equate the region in tariffs with the neighbouring Irkut area with the Hydroelectric Cascade in Angara, archiving from Baykal, the main watershore territory for which Burettia is.

The National Union of Unqualified, Municipal and Cost Workers (GMB) is concerned about the capitalization of the McVitie's factory in Glasgo
The Union requires guarantees from the managers of the MacVitie's biscuit manufacturer in connection with his long-term production obligation in the Glazgo factory.
The Scotland GMB reported that the company had been silent in the future investments at the Tolkros facility.
In the manufacturer's factory, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies, more than 500 people work.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, reports that in recent years it has invested more than 5 million pounds in the facility.
The company adds that, if any change in the work of the facility, the staff and representatives of the trade union “will find out first.”
In a letter to the head of the company, the Scottish GMB office required McVitie's response to anxiety that funding would not be allowed to modernize the production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffy stated: “The members of our trade union are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the Director-General of the Business and Investment Plan on the Future of Tolcross.”
The families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of large workers in local society and in the Great Glasgo; this is the most important pillar of decent work in the territories of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of work, salary and prosperity, and on the basis of Brekzit, the growth of the living minimum and the chronic decline in production, East End Glazgo desperately needs the prosperity of production in the McVitie's factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, “The Tucrosian Managing Office only yesterday received a letter from the Scotland Division of GMB, and the company will answer immediately, since we appreciate our continuing cooperation with the staff and representatives of the trade union”.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives in Tolkros, which openly discussed a number of issues.
We talked to staff that, like all companies working in the maximum competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions - and this concerns all our objects and directions - to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tolkros facility, especially in the production lines and the improvement of functional indicators.”
We fully acknowledge the value of Tolcross as a productive object, and if any change in the work of this facility, the staff and the representatives of the trade union will learn first."
Putin stated that the authorities would not provide guidance to Rosnefty and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin stated that the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Oil Company (UNHC) should be connected to Kremlin and the office of ministers, but the Guzprom instructions as well as Rosnefty would not be given.
Thus, the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, responded to the request of Igor Secin to contribute to the resolution of conflicts.
The head of the State noted that the relationship between Rosneftu and Gazprom should be resolved exclusively on the basis of market principles.
The former chapter of Rosnefty, Igor Secin, at a meeting on large investment projects in the Long-East Federal District, said that the lack of agreement with the Gazprom gas for UNHCR threatened the implementation of the project.
Secin noted that the dialogue with the Gazprom was ongoing.
" Gazprom" suggests finding gas resources from the Rosnefty perimeter, but we do not have such resources," added Secin.
Recall that Rosneft had asked her to allow it to use gas from the Kyrin Gazproma Shelf of Sahalin for the Eastern Oil Company.
In June, Gazprom stated that the negotiations on this issue continued, and there were no sharp corners there.
Has Barcelona been warned of the transition of Neimar three years ago?
La League participant may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
“Pare Saint German” will not stop persecuting Neimar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona of the world's inflammation record that took place three years ago?
The sensational proposal resumed the summer transfer window when the League 1 club was prepared to beat the world record at the cost of the transition, more than twice exceeding the previous marking of the return of Pogba to the Manchester United in the past season of 89 million pounds.
Once the transition is over, Neimar will become the most expensive player in the world, as well as the highest voucher in the world, since the PPP offers a salary of more than 500,000 pounds a week.
It is known that Barcelona was anger of how the proposal was expressed and how Neimar broke the contract, despite the insisting of the source close to the Katalan Club, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the soccer world warned of this possibility three years ago by the President of the PPG?
When Manchester City expressed its interest in the rental of Bless Matthews in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi gave a strong warning to any club who would like to overcome one of the best PPP players.
"I am not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will speak against them, we will make proposals to their players," said Al-Helaifhi.
“We respectfully treat all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, their consequences will be.”
Apparently, Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed its interest in a semi-protector from the PSJ Marco Verratti.
The PPG made it clear that it would not let the Italian player gather under any conditions, and now Barcelona is likely to feel the consequences of his proposal in the form of loss of one of its most valuable players, Neimar.

"I would also like to ask the relevant colleagues about how much money has been paid," said Putin at a meeting with the leaders of the regions located in Baykal.
On 4 August, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the authorized representative of the President of the RF in the Siberian Federal District, Sergei Menylo, and the Chief of the Baikal branch of FGB " Glavribwater " Leonid Mihajlik.
They told me about the cleaning of the lake.
Then they showed the boys in open ingredients next to the container prepared for divorce.
At first, Putin released a few boys from the bag.
Then he pulled a special pin on the container's cover and released the others.
Also, during the journey, the leader ordered him to deal with the environment in Baikal and to build a road on Olhon Island.
According to Minstroy, one amount is required, and it seems to be another amount.
"I want to figure out what happens to finance there," the Russian leader emphasized.
Recall, during the forest fires of 2017, the population of Buryath, the Irkut region, the housing houses and house buildings were destroyed.
