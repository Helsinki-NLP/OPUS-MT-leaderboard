Stars transmit light and heat because of the energy that is generated when hydrogen atoms are connected to form harder elements.
Scientists are working on creating reactors that can generate energy in the same way.
This, however, is a very difficult problem to solve and it will take many years before a useful fusion reactor is built.
Because of the surface voltage, the steel needle float on the water.
The tension on the surface appears because the molecules of water on its surface attract each other much stronger than the molecules of the air that are above.
The molecules of water make an invisible envelope on the surface of the water that allows things like needle to float on the water.
The blade on a modern slider has a double edge with a concave angle between the edges. Two edges enable better ice-cleaning, even when they're on the side.
Given that the bottom of the blade is mildly curved, when the blade scrolls on one or the other side, the edge that is in touch with the ice is also curved.
If the slider slides to the right, the slider will turn right, and if the sliders scroll on the left, the slider will turn left.
In order to return to the previous energy level, the excess energy that they have received from light must be eliminated.
This is what they do by emitting a small particle of light called "foton".
Scientists call this process "simmulated radiation emission" because a bright light stimulates atoms, which causes the emission of photons of light, and light is a type of radiation.
The next picture shows atoms that emit photos. Of course, photons are much smaller than those displayed in the picture.
The photons are even smaller than the elements that make atoms!
After a hundred hours of work, the light fiber eventually burns, and the lamp is no longer working.
Then the lamp should be replaced, and it should be careful when you switch the lamp.
First, the switch for the lighting body or the cable is to be connected.
It is because the electricity that comes to the lighter on which the metal part of the lamp can cause a strong stroke if you touch the inside of the bulb or the metal base while the lamp is partly still in the plug.

Triceratops' teeth could have crushed not only leaves, but even very strong branches and roots.
Some scientists think triceratopas ate cyclades, a type of plants common for the creed age.
These plants look like small palms with a crown of sharp, sharp leaves.
Triceratops could use his strong belt to remove the leaves before eating the tree.
Other scientists argue that these plants are very poisonous and are unlikely to be consumed by any dinosaur, although lying animals and other animals such as potatoes (subsequent to dinosaurs) today can eat poison leaves or fruits.
How would I have been drawn by Iowa's gravity? If you were standing on the surface of Ioa, you would have less weight than on earth.
A person on Earth weighing 200 pounds (90kg) on Iou would weigh about 36 pounds (16kg). Of course, the gravity less attracts you.
The sun has no corn like the Earth on which you can stand, the whole sun is made of gas, fire and plasma.
The more you get away from the center of the sun, the rare the gas.
The outer part that we see when we look at the sun is called a photosphere, which means "light ball."
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galileo via the telescope noticed that Venus, as well as the Moon, has a change.
The changes appear because only the side of Venera (or the moon) was lighted, which was turned towards the sun. Venus's names supported the Kopernikov theory that planets were moving around the sun.
A few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks noticed the passage of Venus.

After the battle for France, Germany began preparing for the attack on the British island.
Germany gave the attack code name "Operation of the sea lion". Many of the heavy weapons and British army stock were lost during the evacuation from Dunkirk, and the army was quite weak.
However, the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy ("Kriegsmare") and was able to destroy any invasion fleet sent through the English channel.
However, a very small number of ships of the Royal Navy was located near the probably routes of attacks because they were admiring to fear that the German air attack would flood them.
Let's start explaining Italy's plans. Italy was mostly a "mlad brother" of Germany and Japan.
She had a weaker army and the Navy, despite the fact that she made four new ships just before the war started.
The main objectives of Italy were African countries, and in order to capture these countries, she had to have a point to send troops to which soldiers could swim across the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
They were therefore forced to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt, and Italian battleships were not supposed to have any other tasks.
Now, something about Japan, Japan was an island country, just like Britain.
The submarines are ships intended for sailing underwater and staying there for a long period of time.
The submarines were used in the First and Second World War, then they were extremely slow and had a pretty limited range of shooting.
At the beginning of the war, mostly they were moving around the surface of the sea, but as the radar began to develop and become more precise, the submarines had to go under water so they could not be discovered.
The German submarines were called U-Boats, and the Germans were very good in the navigation and use of their submarines.
Because of their success with submarines, after the war, the Germans are not trusted enough to allow them to have many.
Yes! King Tutankamon, sometimes also called "King Tut" or "The Boy-King", is one of the ancient Egyptian kings, the most famous in modern times.

Another famous Greek is the mathematician of Pythagora, most famous for the famous theory of relations between sides of rectangular triangles.
There are different estimates about how many people speak the hindu language, and it is estimated that there are speakers between the second and fourth languages in the world.
The number of original speakers is changing depending on whether very closely connected dialects are calculated.
The estimates move from 340 to 500 million speakers, and even 800 million people understand that language.
Hindi and Urdu languages are similar to the vocabulary, but their letters differ; speakers of both languages usually can understand each other in daily conversations.
In the 15th century, North Estonia was under the great cultural influence of Germany.
Several German monks wanted to draw God closer to the people of autochton, so they invented the Estonian literary language.

Teaching the creation of interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools learned in an interactive continuation (regulation of stories, editing audio and video records, story story, etc.)
Interactive design requires you to review the presumptions of media production and learn to think in unconventional ways.
The interactive design requires that the components of the project be connected, but also to be meaningful as a separate whole.
Failure to increase the display is that the focus complexity and number of objective elements are needed to achieve the range of focus lengths much greater than the main objects.
This becomes a smaller problem because the manufacturers achieve greater standards in the production of objectives.
This enabled zooming objects to record photos of quality comparable to those that achieve objects with fixed grain distance.
Another lack of scale objectivity is that the maximum aperture (speed) of the object is usually lower.
Therefore, it is difficult to use cheap objections to increase displays in the conditions of weak lighting without lighting.
One of the most common problems in the film conversion in DVD format is overscan (closing).
Most of the television content is designed to please the public.
That's why everything you see on TV has limits, top, bottom and sides.
This is made to ensure that the image covers the whole screen. It is called the edge area of the screen.

The traditional Mediterranean Castle was a long inspiration for imagination and charmed pictures of the Knight Tournaments, the banket and the knights of King Arthur.
Even if you're standing in the middle of a thousand years of old ruins, it's simply to call the sounds and smells of old fights, you're almost able to hear screwing coppers in the calder and feel fear from the dungeons.
But is our imagination based on reality, why did the castles even build, how are they designed and built?
Kirby Muxloe's castle, typical for that period, looks more like a fortified house than a real castle.
His big glass windows and thin walls could not resist a strong attack for a long time.

The deficit of attention “represents a neurologic syndrome whose classic definition triade of symptoms includes impulsiveness, easy distraction of attention and hyperactiveness or excess energy”.
It's not a difficulty in learning, it's a learning disorder, which "see 3 to 5 percent of all children and possibly even 2 million American children."
Children with disturbance of attention are hardly focused on things like school work, but they can focus on things they enjoy, such as playing games or watching favorite drawing movies or writing sentences without interpunktions.
These children are inclined to get into various troubles because they “behave risky, fall into fights and cause authority” to stimulate their brains, given that their brain cannot be stimulated by normal methods.
Attention disorder affects relationships with peers because other children can’t understand why they act like this or why they write in their way of writing, or that their degree of maturity is different.
Since the ability to adopt knowledge and learn has changed in the previous way, the basic knowledge adoption rate has also changed.

Unlike other primates, hominides no longer use hands to move, carry their weight or swing on trees.
The hand and foot of the chimpanzee are similar sizes and lengths, reflecting the use of arms to carry weight while walking on the wrists.
The human hand is shorter than his feet and has flatter fingers.
The fossil bones of the arms of age between two and three million years reveal this change in terms of the improvement of the hand from the locomotion to the manipulation.
Some people believe that many artificially provoked lucid dreams can often be exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that lucial dreams extend the time between REM phases.
With less REM phases during the night, this condition in which you experience a real dream and your body rests, it becomes so rare that leads to problems.
It's as tired as if you wake up every twenty or thirty minutes and watch TV.
The effect depends on how often your brain is trying to luciously dream during the night.

Probably the most frequent kind of tourism is what most people link to travel -- recreational tourism.
It is when people go to a place that is significantly different from their daily life to relax and entertain.
Beaches, thematic parks and camps are often the most frequent places for a recreational visit to tourists.
If the goal of visiting a particular destination is to know its history and culture, this type of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different characteristics in a country or simply decide to focus on one area.
The colonists, seeing that activity, also called for reinforcement.
The forced attack forces included the 1st and 3rd colonel from New Hampshire, which consisted of 200 people, under the leadership of Colonel John Stark and James Reed (both later became generals).
Stark's people have taken positions along the fence at the north end of the colonist position.
When the wave caused a crack along the Mystic River, northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence with a short stone wall towards the north ending on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark placed a cake about 100 feet (30 m) outside the fence and ordered not to shoot until those who regularly pass through there.
The American plan relied on the launch of coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder would launch a diverzant attack against the British garrison in Bordentown to block any additional backup.
General James Ewing brought 700 members of the military across the river in Trent Ferry, captured the bridge above the stream of Assunpink and prevented the enemy troops from escape.

The species or vision ability depends on the sensor organs of the visible system or eyes.
There are many different eyes structures, with the range of complexity depending on the needs of the organism.
Different structures have different features, sensitive to different wave lengths and different degrees of sharpness, and also require different processing to understand the entry and different numbers for optimum work.
The population is a group of organisms belonging to a certain kind within a geographical area.
When all individuals of the population are identical in terms of a certain phenotype characteristic, they are called monomorphs.
When individuals show several forms of one qualities, they are polymorphical.
Army ants' colonies are also marching and nestling in different phases.
At the nomad stage, the army ants march at night, and they camp and calm in the day.
The colonization begins in the nomad phase when the amount of food available is reduced. During this phase, the colony serves as a temporary nest that is changing every day.
Each of these nomad wildlife or marches lasts within 17 days.
What is the cell? The word of the cell comes from the Latin word “cella, ” which means“ a small room, ” and the first time one of the microscopies used it while watching the structure of the float.
The cell is the basic unit of living beings and all the organisms make one or more cells.
The cells are so basic and crucial to study life that, in fact, we often call them “the building blocks of life. ”

Elements and connections can go from one state to another without changing.
The nitrogen like gas has the same properties as the liquid nitrogen, the fluid state is dense, but the molecules are still the same.
The water is another example: the water is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atoms.
It has the same molecular structure, whether it's in gas, liquid or solid state.
Although his physical condition can change, his chemical condition remains the same.
Time is all around us and affects everything we do, but it's hard to understand.
Religious, philosophical and scientific scholars have studied time for thousands of years.

By listening to individuals sharing personal, family and organizational stories, we have a valuable perception of the past and some of the personalities that had a good or bad influence on the culture of the organization.
Although understanding of someone's history does not mean understanding of culture, it at least helps people to feel where they belong in the history of the organization.
By assessing the success and becoming aware of the failure, individuals and persons who have participated as a whole deeper disclose the values, tasks and mobile forces of the organization.
In this case, reminding the previous examples of entrepreneurship and success associated with this behaviour helped people to be open to new changes and new direction for the local church.
Such stories have reduced fear of change and have also established positive tendencies to change in the future.
The convergence patterns of thinking are the solution techniques that unify different ideas or areas to find solutions.
The focus of this way of thinking is speed, logic and precision, as well as the notion of facts, re-use of existing techniques, collecting information.
The most important factor in this way of thinking is: there's only one exact answer. You only mean two answers -- the one that's accurate and the wrong one.
This method of thinking is related to certain scientific or standard procedures.
People who think this way, think logically, and they can remember samples, solve problems, and work on scientific tests.
People are the most talented species when it comes to reading the thoughts of others.
That means we are able to successfully predict what others observe, intend, believe, know or want.
Within these ability, understanding the intention of others is of crucial importance, allowing us to solve the possible unanimity of physical activities.
For example, if you saw someone breaking the car window, you would probably assume that he was trying to steal another car.
He should be judged differently if he lost his car keys and tried to break into his car.
The MRI is based on a phenomenon from physics known as a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), discovered by Felix Bloch (of Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (of Harvard University).

This point is illustrated by our current experience with all tasks for self-work, information presented and television shows based on learning.
Many of us are watching television shows that we are informed of the process or experience in which we will never participate or apply that knowledge.
We'll never serve the car, build a fountain in the courtyard, travel to Peru to review the ancient ruins or renovate the neighbor's house.
