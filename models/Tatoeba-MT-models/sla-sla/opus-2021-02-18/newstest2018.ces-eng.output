Civil rights movement issued travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Administering of Colour Persons (NAACP) has published warnings for colored people traveling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory principles of State and racist attacks.
“The NAACP travel recommendation for the Missouri State, with effectiveness from 28 August 2017, calls on African travelers, visitors and residents of Missouri to take more attention in the way of a series of disputed racially motivated incidents that are currently happening throughout the country”, states the Association.
NAACP stated that this step has been accompanied on the basis of the current laws of the Missouri State that discontinue the defence of racistically motivated acts against the court, as well as in the consequence of the proceedings of criminal authorities which are unduly targeting minorities.
“There is a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped by police just because of the color of their skin, they are attacked or murdered," said for Kansas City Star President NAACP for Missouri Rod Chapel.
"The biggest amount of complaints has yet been quantified."
It is the first warning of its species issued by the organization for the state of the United States.
Among the incidents she quoted by the organization, racially motivated dangers were targeted against black skin students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in controversial circumstances at the beginning of this year after he was out of gasoline when he was traveling across the state and the police put him in custody without charge of committing a crime.
The Travel Recommendation also notes the recent statement of the highest state representation of Missouri, which states that the black skin drivers have 75% higher chances to stop the police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to warn people and warn their families, friends and colleagues from what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
“People must be prepared - they should drive money with them to the eventual bail or to warn their relatives that they are going to travel by the state.”
According to the current numbers of the FBI programme to report hatred acts in 2015 in Missouri, hundreds of cases of hatred behaviour, which brings the state to the sixteenth place between all countries.
The travel warning is also an answer to the new law of Missouri, which disturbs the complaint of the company for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The American Union for Civil Freedoms (ACLU) issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after the States approved an immigration law which allows State actors to detain people on the basis of the violations of this law, which should improve racial profilation according to ACLU.
The travel recommendation is usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but recently, the advocacy groups have not responded to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the United States.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family even after 12 years has no peace!
Sally Anne Bowman's model was murdered.
The girl from Croydon was murdered by boss Mark Dixie in 2005 directly in the restaurant in which she worked, he planted her stab wounds.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex together and smoke the marijuana, then he killed her.
Then the killer sat in the nearby cafeteria and watched a careful criminal work to search for the crime scene.
Dixie, former chef, was convicted in 2008 to abduct freedom of 34 years for murder and rape of Sally's model.
The guy in court admitted only the attack of a youth, and his lawyer claimed that his client already found a girl dead on the street.
After three years, the police accused him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-friend Lewis Sprotson had a fateful night arguing.
The killer said, "He was really angry and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"She even attracted attention to the taxiers," he claimed fakely.
The girl was supposed to be defending himself by his confession, what she could, of course, in vain.
Lewis should've stabbed her on the street.
Dixie's version was proved to be a lie and accused him.
After Dixie's confession, he talked about his enthusiasm and taste for a girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to burn the marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was at his ex-girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, he said to the police himself, Dexie.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her back and put his hand over her mouth," added the Mirror Linda.
And after twelve years, the family faces other attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
He's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are so cruel people on the loose that dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," said the Mirror's mother of the dead girl Linda's information about the disappearance of urna with ash.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators are worth tens of thousands.
"The Czechs are not fertile or conservative," said Martin Rja, who operates the Prague Botique Intimity.
You'll find design and luxury erotic devices in it.
Including those from the Czech designer, Anna Maresch.
It started at least 12 years ago.
Martin Raj and his friends went to a cycle after Morava.
One of them brought not only a bike but also a box full of vibrators.
"Various creams and dolphins and all that was green and yellow and just different," he tells me about lunch.
His friend and another companion decided to cooperate with the German producer of the Fun Factory design devices, which fascinated Martin, so he offered to help with marketing.
When a colleague left so he could devote to another profession, he replaced it.
Today he operates in the Prague Benedict Street butik Intimity, where he sells erotic tools in the way they usually offer luxury purse or shoes.
Why not?
It's also design objects.
Wait, wait, wait, you're talking about this at lunch, you think?
Oh, come on, don't be such puritans!
The Berlin shop Fun Factory, which suggested a recognised designer Karim Rashid, served as inspiration for the botic Intimity.
It was opened in 2010, and it was a completely different concept of erotic trade than everyone used to here.
No hidden exhibitions, all made in a beautiful, decent style, products exposed rather as in parfume.
Martin and his business partner Zenek Shebelka began to think about how to conceive the Prague trade where he should be and what he should be called.
The name of Intimity loved both of them.
"It remains related to intimacy, and it is also, can be said, gentle," he says.
Followed the purchase of the Internet domain and searching for a suitable space that went parallelly with various interior visualisations.
Finally, she won a variety that placed a trade in the garden of pleasures and bedrooms of the duke.
It was prepared by Dagmar Stefan from the FormaFatal Study.
We found a space in 2013.
At first, he didn't seem perfect because he wasn't on the main street, but he was sitting in the name of Intimity.
He's intimate.
He's in the street next to the main, so no one's got customers," Martin Rjah commends himself.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to make a trade that would be different, with marked goods, in the environment where women who are mostly our customers feel good.
And not that they're ashamed of entering such a shop at all.
When I walked into the Intimity Boutique half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Besides, I didn't even feel like I could go to a erotic store.
At the door, I was surprised by a pure elegance of the interior that I know from the botics with fashion.
Even though there's only a woman's service in the shop, not to shy to ask for help, it doesn't mean that a man's leg would not come here.
Most of the gentlemen come here to shore gifts for their girlfriend.
"The men mostly can't estimate the right size and choose more," Martin smiles over a frequent error.
That's the kind of prejudice, the experienced cliché that women need some big help, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith chooses an inadequate vibrator.
Likewise, men choose mostly black underwear, where a woman usually tends more to pink color.
Absolute bestseller is currently a product called Satisfyer.
From the expression in my face, it must be clear that I don't know who's beating because Martin explains immediately how it works.
That's such an intact clitoris stimulator.
There is an adolescent need in me to cherish with admiration over what serious tone is given to me.
It's like it didn't work out.
And it doesn't actually sniff.
It's a good price and has a perfect user reference.
We didn't believe he'd be accepted so well.
It's about some last revolutionary news.
The first revolution caused a vibrator in the shape of the sea horse.
He made sure that women were more interested in designing such products.
The second one was a Vibrator for We-Vibe couples.
He completely broke the tab, which some men can persist, and that they see competition in erotic helps.
"They do different options," he continues.
With one engine, two engines, remote control.
That's the favorite category.
In love connection, a woman can have a controller in her hand and determine the intensity of vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain rupee is a category of vibrators.
Well, at least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multipurpose aids and buy classic vibrators, even though they may only use it externally.
However, in Western Europe, especially in younger customers, it is very popular.
What about men?
It's hard to say if a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I guess it'd have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin considers.
"We also have helps for them, but in a limited manner." Mostly, the masturbator is sold, in this case from the Tenga producer.
Because it doesn't seem like an anatomic imitation of the vagina, but "as rather like a shower gel or like an egg or a futurist object.
It focuses much on functionality and experiences in use.
In Japan, it's quite different.
It makes me amazed.
I thought the Japanese would suffer a lot of erotic relief, I'm saying.
"It's the Internet reality," I'm explained.
The usual is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more connected to the use of women.
In Japan they are totally normal for men, and they are tabua for women." Only for interest -- what the Japanese Tenga mark, who is represented in the butic of Intimity, sells worldwide, still forms about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and the Czechs aren't strudder.
On the contrary, we are a whole nation.
Definitely unlike countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical trade client moves between 35 and 50 years and "with a certain experience, however, with sexual life, but with some helps.
It comes for something nice, more qualitative, to supplement a partner life, or for herself." To return, Martin Rja and his business partner, Zedenka, they care to make sure that each product is perfectly functional.
We also don't want to go into the type of bondage and latex speciality, because we don't have space for it, but it's not exposed.
Such things could be distracted by those we're trying to target.
Which are people who always had a shame in the sex store because they were afraid that something would look at them.
Many of the products presented on the cheeks are really pleasant.
It is also given by the selection of represented renowned marks.
Some of them even gained design prices, including Red Dot Design Award.
The first estimated sea horse was mentioned "and it started a change throughout the sector.
It began to drop out of cheap materials and work with healthy inconvenient, other designs, different colors...
It is pleasant that some are behind the design of Czech Republic, even though the popular designer Anna Marresh.
I have to say, I'm pretty nice to be surprised how many people have been buying these designs with us by Anna Maresch, even though they're relatively expensive.
There are customers walking directly for Venus's bullets from Anne Maresch.
She did a really huge piece of work by representing exactly what we are trying to present in the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic tools can be done differently, nice, with a story.
Anne's story started as a school job.
Now it's a finished product, which is also produced with us.
I wanted to have the process of production under control, and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Because it's not a big robbery, but a small series, it's certainly more expensive than a big series.
Maybe I'm going a little against the stream, but I think it's important to keep the development in the Czech Republic.
It could be peaceful that in a few years, we will not be able to produce anything," Anna tells me later, which agrees with Martin that our company is increasingly open.
It is not met with a negative or rejective attitude.
Most of the people are disappointed.
"But even you start smiling." Anne Maresh now has a vibrator in her offer, for which you can have a personal message, and this year she also plans her own librarian gel.
In the next year, vibration eggs and other news should be arrived.
Boundaries of healthy sex
I'm wondering where the limit of what's fine is.
Is there anything Martin Rage wouldn't sell anymore?
It's very difficult to define.
Whatever happens to one normal one, the other may seem completely abnormal, so we're rather defined by a classification of marked producers.
None of them get into some extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have the last question: what was the most crazy demand they got?
Just now a week, an e-mail came, in which a lady asked for a masturbation help for her friend with nature of 20 inches.
So we had to write that, unfortunately, we didn't have anything like that.
It's still the question whether anyone was joking of us," Martin measuring me with a suspicious view.
And that happens from time to time...
Karl Gott's injury.
After two cancers of Alzheimer!
His friend Karel Christmas fights a serious disease.
Carl Gott's best friend is fighting the disease that stoles people of all the memories.
"Yes, it's unfortunately true," he confirmed the sad information to the Flash itself.
I know about my illness, and so far, I can handle it very well in terms of circumstances.
"I take medications that have a leading phenomenon of disease to slow down," he added, thanking the closer for support.
The whole cultivated family came to make it easier for Karl.
Eve's wife is trying to be home, as much as possible, to her dad's home on White Mountain, even daughters from the first marriage of Zuzan and Teresa, the son of Karel speaking Karlas.
He fought cancer twice and gave his experience to Slavik to support him during his difficult treatment.
He's got 60 chemotherapy behind him.
He was able to return to work after them and to the tennis court and to ski conventions.
"Astrolog told me I'll be here by 90," said Karel Blesk.
He's a warrior.
They still want to sing.
"I repeat the words of the song so that I don't forget them," Karel admitted.
The same sickness is now struggling in the Constitution as well as the actress of Cvet Fial.
Do you have a patient with Alzheimer in your family?
Look at how you treat him.
The Chile Parliament has cancelled the prohibition of interruption, the law shall judge the US.
In Chile, the absolute prohibition of the artificial interruption of pregnancy is still subject to, therefore, not to be carried out for health reasons.
"I hate that the lawmakers filed a complaint to the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide about what we have argued in the parliament for more than two years," the Socialist Senator Isabel Allende complained.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and at the end of August should receive a new Chairperson, who, according to AFP, is a close opposition.
The law to break the absolute ban of interruption, launched by President Michelle Bachelet, approved the Senate on July 19th.
The right opposition then announced that the law would be attacked in court because it said that it violated the right of an unborn child to live.
The Members of the vote on the proposal for the law last month postponed until the mixed parliamentary committee is analysed.
In Wednesday, the Members approved the proposal and reconstructed the Senate after them.
According to the new legislative amendment, the criminal artificial interruption of pregnancy should be ceased in three cases: if the life of a woman is threatened, if the fetus does not have a hope for survival, or if pregnancy has emerged from rape.
Similar exemptions existed in the Spanish newspaper El País in Chile since 1931, that is even before women received election law in 1949.
Absolute ban on interruptions in 1989 introduced the right dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before he left the president's office.
Chile is one of the small countries in the world where absolute bans of interruptions are paid.
These are Nikaragua, the Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in Salvador, there are now about 20 women behind the nets, who have been deprived of up to 30 years of prison penalty for interruption.
In many cases, the human rights defenders of spontaneous abortion, which the court called murder.
Is there anything else holy?
The target of Trump's White House is now the Souch of Freedom
The unfailing sign of modification is the criticism of statues.
The Americans could tell about this as well as all others - see the carefully imposed shopping of Saddam Husain's statue at the Firdos Baghdad Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key advocates of Trump's regime, surely knew what he's up to when at a passionate debate with CNN Jim Acosto on the topic of president's proposals for a drastic restriction of legal immigrants, he went to the symbolic axe on the Svoboda Soup.
It's good to add that Miller didn't attack a statue like that.
For that, the crowd of the owners of the trip ships and the imitators of the Svoboda Statue.
However, he attacked her meaning, especially the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous Emmy Lazarus, up to 17 years after the completion of the monument was placed on the ground.
Miller punished Acosta by saying: “I don't want to go into history here, but the Souch of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that brings light to the world.
The poem which was placed on the basis further and which you refer to is not part of it."
Miller's actually right, but as he said, it's not about history.
It is not only the poorest of the poorest: "Let's come to me, who falls, who poor, who can breathe freely, who is hardly allowed to breathe, who is a poor worm in the middle of the full cities."
And right now we can watch these poor worms on our screens better than ever.
Miller didn't try to criticize poetry - he wanted to explain that these people weren't welcomed in the United States.
This conflict on the importance of the statue is part of a large political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict on the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as her friends who after her death seeked to plant a plaque with poetry on the basis of the statue, knew quite well that she was launching a high political game.
The statue was to express the connection of the French and American republic government by representing the classical theme, i.e. the women's freeness.
Emma Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem there is no woman's abstract character, but she has her own voice.
He also has a very different name: the Mother of Exilers.
The merger of poetry with the imagination of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And the same way Emma Lazarus has changed the meaning of the statue, the right-man has long been trying to vomiting this meaning.
A famous commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jan Baptist in the case of Trump's appearance to power - in 2010, argumented that the Socha of Freedom does not actually bring anyone into the country, but represents the early non-constructiveism, bringing an American flame to the rest of the world: “Socha Freedom is moving forward.
He delivers the torch of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch should not light the way to the United States."
Limbaugh's embarrassing the important thing.
The significance of the statue depends on the angle of the view.
Emma Lazarus describes a statue from the view of an exhausted and damn passenger, who many times after long and scary journey across the ocean, comes with hope in the heart to the new country.
It is literally about the world's eyes of people who are looking for refuge and the chance of a better life.
From this perspective, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And of course that's the perspective that Miller and Trump definitely won't recognize.
Their torch should not light the way, but explode hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championship in athletic 2017: Neil Black sings praise on the Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time the British team had only two Scots members.
The Director of the Athletic Federation of the United Kingdom Neil Black stated that the strong squadra of 16 Scots in the World Championship team will be “a huge benefit for the team”.
For MS in London 2017, which begins Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes was selected.
Black believes that in Scotland “there is something special ” and British athletics could learn from the Scots.
"We try to understand and adapt - we will work on it," Black said.
"I spoke to people from the Scotland Sports Institute, and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The representatives of the Scottish athletics think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
That's what people on the streets think.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will seek medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle was elected as Captain of the team.
“Eilid is modest.
Her introduction speech was amazing," said Black.
“A few athletes, whether the Scotts or the athletes of other nationalities, were coming out of the room with a feeling of huge pride and motivation.
The feelings that Eilid spoke to were unrepealable."
The silver medalist of the Commonwealth, who will compete in a run through 400 m obstacles at its fifth world championship, stated that it is "unbelievable" that there are 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record of 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The runner on the middle track, Muir, only fixed five British and two European records in the last year.
The MS will take part in the running at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who runs a 1500m track. In this year's season he won the British Team Races and Annual Games.
Doyle remembers her first championship, where she was the only other Scotch member of Lee McConnell's team.
The captain of the team led her to “very proud ” of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues arrived in the team but in many cases, they will also attack the participation in the finals and medals.
"The unusual position of the captain's team is that I was elected by other members of the team. It was a great honour to me, but the awareness that I was elected by members of the team is satisfactory," she added.
"I am obviously very proud of all the Scots who got into the team.
It proves where we just moved.
They're athletes who'll think about the front places on the stage.
And my introduction speech?
Yeah, I think she did.
I only noticed that we can be proud at this year’s championship because it is on homeland.
It is important to use the support of home fans and to rejoice that we are back on the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance to race and I'll enjoy an incredible atmosphere."
Facebook criticism blocking: Do not apply to public functions unless you face the criticism of the voters
The father of our country knew about his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long to start criticizing him for anything, starting with foreign policy and ending his political views.
Yes, this criticism didn't leave him cold.
But he didn't try to shut the criticism.
Because in 1783 Washington said: “The freedom of speech can be taken away - and stupid and by it we will be led as sheep to defeat. ”
That brings me to Maryland is the governor Larry Hogan who needs to work on acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the US Union for civil freedoms.
The governors of the prosecution rejected as reasonless, and many views of the type “who cares about it ” appeared in the comments on the Internet.
"It's just Facebook," many users said.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it's about people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, it is an incredibly popular Republican governor.
He can be praised by the second highest favorite of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not creepy.
As it appears, its state is safely managed and strictly respects the principles.
It turns out that it is also reversed in using Facebook as the main means to connect with its voters - except that there is no publication of the first photo with a goal head after the chemotherapy exploitation.
Blocking people who welcome the governor's website - which is a public forum, marked as official and managed by his employees paying money from taxpayers - is inadequate and endlessly dangerous.
In the interview for Washington Post Hoganov speaker Amelia Chassea defended the governor by blocking comments from the position of modification of contributions.
However, using a picture of internet trolls, spammers or angry people is too easy.
Washington Post confessed several real people to whom the contributions were deleted.
And they are also - real people who speak to their elected leaders; teacher, businessman and pastor, no trolles.
As all said, their comments were kind and respectful, not creepy.
The shepherd quoted the Bible in his comment, appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Md., asked about hatred crimes, but her comment was not hated.
"I kindly noted that I was disappointed with his insufficient response to hatred crimes and other current reports," wrote Washington Post, commentary section.
"I don't like the idea that once a number of people comment on the same subject, some people are marked as promoting so-called collective efforts, instead of being recognised as a larger group of interested citizens."
What governors called “concentrated spam interest ” others would probably call “the defense. ”
The modern Facebook era allows us to manage contributions by blocking criticisms or erasing negative comments.
It's much more comfortable than in the past when the same procedure would require the sending of employees to the streets where they would collect and burn all prints with critics or arrest or silence protestants.
And that's exactly what's going on, just in a digital form.
Hogan is not the last public factor to be criticised for shameing Facebook and other social media.
The President Trump faces a complaint by the Twitter users who have refused access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
President Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first supplement in Alexandria by district judge James C. Cacherise, where she prevented access to one of its Facebook pages.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) from Kentucky also welcomed a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington’s days, the low price of the mail was practically the same effect as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily press was four times multiplied, and his position was challenged by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People who write under pseudonoms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote letters to the newspaper and questioned Washington’s decision.
According to historical documents collected by people under the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions in his office criticizing his opinion on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and intimidation is in the foundations of our nation.
And the true leader must accept it.
The Czechs quickly used free roaming, consuming more data in abroad than home.
In abroad, they consume more of their tariff than home.
They are most frequently moved in Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season is the Duke of Croatia.
However, on vacation they have more time to browse on the web, but under the sunshine they do not most have the possibility to join Wi-Fi.
The beach, the bath and the smart phone in your hand.
This looks like a typical Czech holiday in Croatia after customers can use the services of local operators for home prices.
It comes from fresh statistics of O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers in abroad have more data available within the paushale than home.
It is not surprising that in Croatia, where the winter is driven by the minimum of ours, the consumption of data in the summer season increased even 50 times.
In the second place in the stairs of consumed data, Italy was placed.
The Czech Republic will call from Germany for most minutes, where many of them are exploiting working and summers.
Croatia, according to the data of the Czech travel office Association, will visit 800,000 Czech people annually, is our most popular vacation destination.
But people here exchanged a book for sharing experiences with a mobile phone.
The record was this year's July 7th.
"The data transferred would include dozens of million photographs," the director of the mobile segment in O2 Silvia Cieslar detailed.
Although Croatia leads in volumes of data, the highest number of Czech users is moving in neighbouring countries.
In the first place, Austria follows Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is up to fourth and Italy sixth.
We go to Austria walking tourism and active vacation, for which we don't have much time to browse on the Internet.
"Furthermore, through Austria, Czechia is heading towards the Adriatics," Ceeslar explained.
While the operator recorded in data after the release of roaming fees high inter-year growth, the telephone growth is much lower.
The number of minutes caused in the roaming increased compared to last year's double.
With a huge increment in front of other countries, Germany is dominating here.
"The roaming calls are rather used by company customers on workways," Ceeslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes in the home atmosphere at Renaissance Club
The former golf unit Ronan Rafferty will hope for the next three days in a comfortable atmosphere in the Renaissance Club in the Scottish East Lothian administrative area, hosting the 25th year of Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year at the nearby golf field Archerfield Links on his way to the final. This year, he will perform the role of the Ambassador's tournament as the founder of the club and the CEO of Jerry Sarvadi.
"I was watching the Renaissance Club grows slowly in front of me, and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty," Rafferty said.
“The players will be able to love the first-class quality of the field.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a zealous defender of this game and is proud of his success.
This year's tournament is in the right hands."
The English Eales will first defend the championship title, despite the winning of the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I have a good feeling of it," said the Southport golfist.
"I had no possibility to defend my victory at Extremadura Open, because a year after my victory the tournament was cancelled.
Return to this part of the country is magic.
It's a beautiful golf place.
I remember last year when Sharon and my wife meant a victory really much.
It was a beautiful time I would not forget."
The homeland returns to Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years from the region of this year.
This event will be his first participation from Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play on homeland," said Orr about Helensburg.
"You want to do well and feel a lot of pressure.
I really loved playing again, and I think I'm doing good.
I'm really happy with the result."
The three players are also joined by the former winner of Masters Ian Woosnam and the winners of the senior tournaments Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former captain of the Rider Cup Sam Torrance are among the six Scottish players on the field; others include Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The tournament is free. Parking is 5 pounds per car with one passenger and 10 pounds per car with two and more passengers.
All profits will be devoted to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian land of gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the bacon.
In fact, he's rarely using a pan.
In its wooden chamber, located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesia Province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the language of local "nota" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour of potatoes, he'll taste it with his unwashed hands.
Bardina is sitting on a dirty land - the house is not equipped with furniture - where he also does his daily work, such as washing laundry in a dirty water from a nearby swamp.
The toilet in the room without a roof is supplied.
As the youngest of four wives of her husband, no field was assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Work by late night is a danger: most of the people in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, in the village, they are living soldiers.
"No one will afford to travel around the village after 5 p.m.," says Bardina.
It is a rare view of daily life on the highshore of Papui, a former Dutch colony, which was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote in a form of public removal before the occupiing army.
The current protesting movement against the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakart government, which controlled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papuu and Western Papua - the independent Papua-Nova Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and desolate city where you get after a ninety-minute flight from the main city of Jayapura province to Nabira, and then a 5-hour stomach riding.
The mass transport is not working in this place.
The city with 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses covered by bambus fences, roofs of waveed blades in shadows of gray and cut color.
There were only very few Indonesians, including journalists, and almost no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christians, locals worshiped the god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We were not used to wearing these dresses," says Bardina, pointing to his colored, handwritten turbana, dark shirt and a glowing skirt.
"We used to wear only leaves."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the inhabitants live under the poverty border and the child's mortality and literacy is one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, it is the Indonesian land of gold.
The largest and most equitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMorean from US Phoeenix, is only 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province of approximately the size of New Jersey, which is home of about 153.000 inhabitants.
Only in 2015 Freeport pulled here gold and copper worth $3.1 billion.
Furthermore, Papua supports the wood delivery of estimated $78 billion.
However, these wealths are the source of suffering and the guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
From an investigation carried out in the New York Times in 2005, Freeport paid some 20 million dollars to local military factors and units between 1998 and 2004, including $500,000 for one officer.
The papuas calling for self - control threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely oppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 Papuas have been killed since 1969 and thousands of others have been raped, tricked and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
The mass murders in the Papui tribal area during the 1970s were equal to genocide, as the Asian Commission for Human Rights stated.
Only last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful protestants in the region.
We Will Lose All, the report of the Brisbane Arcidiecésis of 2016, describes the cruelities that happened last year as an extrajudicial execution, torture - according to the next report is particularly popular rape and execution of electric currents - and brutal oppression of peaceful demonstrators.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonean researcher of the Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation has embarrassed the fact that Papua's sources are attracting colonists to Indonesia.
From 3.5 million inhabitants here, 83% of the province is reported to Christianity, but demography is changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Bornea, Sumatry and Sulawes.
Javan canteens sell roasted chickens and gado-gado, or mixture of vegetables with nut sauce.
Local people fight for survival.
"The Imigrants began selling chicken and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuans," explains the fourteen-year-old Abeth You, who was born at Paniai and moved to the capital of Jayapura province.
"Original inhabitants of Papua - Mother-Mama (Women) - so lost their job."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, named Joko, promised to solve the inequality and violation of rights within his presidential campaign in 2014.
The former carpenter also secured his way to the Presidential Palace in coat 27 of 29 districts of Papui, including Paniai.
But in Papua, it has changed very little, and local people feel betrayed.
"Our heart was broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with hope that he will hear our call for justice," you said.
The fact is that only two months after October's inauguration, Jakov had a great shock.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children singed Christmas songs at the campfire in the city of Enarotali, when two Indian soldiers broke out of the shera night on motorcycles.
Two of the surprised children told them they should turn on lights.
One of the soldiers said that the elevation and tone that had been raised and later returned to four other soldiers, the local pharaiist Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in a drowned state persecuted a group of children and beat them with their weapons, introduced victims and witnesses of events.
One of the soldiers then fired a group of children.
One of the children, a 16 - year - old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone burned the nearby building of the electoral committee, and the next day things were still out.
About 1,000 young papuanic men and women gathered at the football field in front of the local police station and military command and demanded justice.
They came with the ritual hunting ports and performed a dance of waita - in which it runs in the circle and is imitated by the singing of birds - the Papua tribe of Mee Pago.
Several protestants started throwing stones into buildings.
With a degreeing tension, soldiers were issued through the radio: “If the crowd attempts to resist at least three times, you have the permission to shoot,” said the TIME week in the official document whose content has never been published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), head of the quarter of Enarotali Kogo Koto, recognized the dangers and called on the people to divorce their homes.
But no one had care of his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," said the TIME week on the veranda of his painted wooden house.
Kayame doesn't know who was the shooter yet, but according to his words, a bullet belonged to one of the present soldiers.
"There were a lot of people all around, and there was a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the local inhabitants, Alfius Youw, said his cousin, who was witnessing the shooting, was hit three times immediately.
"I ran to the body to make sure it's really him," she said to TIME in a twisting voice, Yohanes, who, as many Indoneans, uses only one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
The Papua police inspector, General Yote Mende, told the journalists that his officers only “provided” the station under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten us with death," Papua's Police press spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch, five protestors were killed and many escaped injuries.
The murder report came up with the Jakart media the next day.
Three weeks later, he gave Joku a passionate speech in Jayapur and expressed his understanding for the families of victims and promised that he would deal with violence in Papua.
"I request an immediate solution to this problem so that he can never repeat itself," he said.
The Minister of National Security Wiranto announced in October 2016 that he would introduce an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve the violent acts that have occurred in the past.
But almost immediately the excuses began.
“The majority of violent acts have been committed a long time ago.
Some of them came up in the 1990s and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be a simple task," he said.
However, Wiranto claimed that he did not plan any measures in Papua in the June 5th week for the TIME week held in Jakarta.
Instead, he said that “all cases will be presented to the court. ”
Wiranto, charged by the United Nations for “the crimes against humanity” on the basis of more than one thousand dead during the independent elections of 1999 in East Timor, stated that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the incident in Paniai, have yet been resolved.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Paniaa welcomed his claims with untrusted confidence.
"In the last three years, I have been questioned a whole number of four times, but I have not yet waited for anything," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many people of Paniai who are afraid of the incident to speak.
He said he was beaten by the members of the army after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After the funeral of the bodies, the army began to seek me," he said.
And the shooting's not stopping yet.
On Tuesday, the Indian police shot the villagers in the Neighbourhood Deiyai.
A fight in which one person died and another 17 was injured was held between villagers and the construction firm manager who refused to provide help in the transport of a man in a nonconscious hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned in fishing in the nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angered villagers protested in front of the company's building.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing on their own stones, and their answer was a warning shooting.
However, local inhabitants claim that the mobile brigade (Indonean paramilitarist police) started shooting in a crowd and killed one person.
"The panic occurred, we were afraid of retaliation," said for TIME 29-year-old Doming Badi, who lives near the hospital and was witnessing the arrival of the injured.
"I haven't left the house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament demanded punishment of participating police officers and downloading mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always a corn in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of sensitive development only enhancing the separation of the native people of the tribes of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in central heights.
Many of them joined the Papuai Movement for Liberation (OPM) - the army of rebels who protects the rights of the Papuas by attacking and kidnapping Indian police officers.
Some of the OPM leaders are from Paniai, not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the army has arrested in recent years and freely detained thousands of inhabitants of Paniai, all under the reason “the security of national sovereignty. ”
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among the inhabitants of Papuai as “thragic and forgotten place”.
Oil is poor.
That little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the local.
And the bread is still unattainable.
These inhabitants grow their foods: especially sweet potatoes, fruits and leave vegetables.
Women work on the fields; each of them processes four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvests are intended for family needs, the rest are selling in the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabir Airport opened more airways and new immigrants began to stream into the country, there is a growing economic inequality between the birth papua and the immigrants.
There are so few jobs that usually take more educational and wealthy immigrants.
The Papuas rarely have the capital and education needed so that they can get into business.
"Young people move from villages because of the lack of job opportunities and money," said John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Because of the isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
It also contributes to strict rules for foreign journalists.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudia and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from Papua, for the reason of “deficiency with the authorities”, despite the fact that they received such rare film permits.
Phelim Kine, Deputy Director of the Asian Division of Human Rights Watch, promised Joku in his election campaign to cancel the strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development.
“Foreign journalists who work in the rebellious eastern areas of Papua and Western Papua are at risk: no recognition of visas and classification on the black sheet”, he stated in the statement.
The lack of reports from per foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesia in Papui is significantly limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council on the investigation of “different and extended violent acts” in Papua, including the shooting in Paniai.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
The speaker of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir condemned when he declared to the journalists in Jakart that “the democratic system is still valid in Indonesia and the media are free, so it is difficult to mask evidence of violations of human rights. ”
Local people call after the participation of foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by a human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on 4 May, local people called for a source that also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous, the password "we want freedom".
Other elections are planned for 2019 in Indonesia, but the Papuas say they will not vote Jokow.
"Joku is a man who has good intentions, but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Paniai," said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jok to know that the people of Paniai -- except that they live in constant fear of the robbery army -- are fighting in poverty, poor education and the health system.
Gobai claims that the inhabitants of Paniai, like the other Papua, consider their voice “long, ” which must pay Joku.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family of the victims of the pania shooting, they continue in the last symbolic act of opposing: they bury victims' bodies on the ground against the police and military station.
With the awareness that justice will never be done enough, at least he will not allow responsible persons to forget their crimes.
"He was killed by a member of our family," Yacobus said with a compounded head.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy caught a huge carriage of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy held a yacht in the Pacific, connecting 1,46 tonnes of cocaine worth approximately $256 million.
The shipment was heading to Australia.
The four-member crew of the ship was arrested, apparently formed by people from Lithuania and Latvia.
The yacht, named Afalina, swimmed from South America and the police dragged her to the port of Nouméa, the metropolitan of the French Overseas Territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific.
The Australian Rapporteur Service stated that in collaboration with its international partners, it would seek to determine exactly where, where and where drugs would go, and to reveal the Lithuanian syndicate.
"We are grateful to the French authorities for measures that have prevented a large quantity of drugs from going to Australia," said her executive Director Col Blanch.
Drugs were destroyed this week in Nouméa.
Australia is an attractive goal for their smugglers because of high street drug prices.
The country also faces the problem of increasing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current scope is not the first in recent times.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting large numbers of drugs from the United States to Australia, trying to cross the Pacific in a small plane.
Seniors don't feel thirsty, drinks need to be reminded of them.
This may be a problem in senior homes, a solution from a doctor from the Gyriatric Clinic General Faculty Hospital in Prague of Paula Madles could be the infusion of physiological solutions that are poured with a thin needle under the skin.
But so far, they only apply in health facilities.
The older a person, the more the water in his body drops.
"And also loses the feeling of thirsty, so the seniors generally take less fluids and are very quickly dehydrated," said Madlowa.
Two litres should be drinked for sure.
"But getting into an old man so much fluid is a big problem," she added.
In the older homes, she often thinks that no doctor is watching it.
In hospitals, dehydration usually deals with infusion.
"I think that there should be a gradual introduction to get subcutaneous infusion," she said.
In a day, old people can add up to two half-litre bottles of physiological solution.
Insufficient liquids may cause maltality, headache and reduced performance.
The dehydration is manifested as a total loss of self-sufficience.
"One day the old man says he can't get out of bed, speak confusedly," she added.
In the case of neglect, it may occur until the brain event.
Blood is collapsed and collapsed in the brain, and renal failure is also threatened.
Lieutenant patients should not be covered with pearl, maximumly cottoned.
The problem may also be one-time fought.
"It's medically more difficult, but it'd be ideal for the patient to discover and let the skin be aired," the doctor said.
In Dubai, the Torch was burned twice
In Dubai, on Friday, there was one of the largest dwelling clouds in the world. The firemen had to evacuate all inhabitants of 337 meters high and 79 floors of buildings.
In the last two years, there is already a second fire of this high building, which brings a suitable name The Torch (Torch).
All the inhabitants of the building were evacuated and there was no injury.
"We slept and awakened the alarm. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor," said for Reuters Gerogue, one of the inhabitants of the darkness.
The Dubai Civil Defense stated that firefighters managed to control around the fourth hour of the morning (0:00 GMT), and continued to cool the building.
Government representatives added that they provide replacement accommodation for disabled persons.
The incident could reiterate a debate on the safety of materials used to cover high buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation which started the leading of the Torch cloud after the fire in 2015 resulted in the most damage to the coverage and external panels used for decoration or isolation.
The British Police stated that the isolation system and covering of the London Greenfell Tower could contribute to the rapid spread of fire at the June fire, where nearly 80 people died.
The results of the survey showed that more than one of the five travellers in the United States are transferring banned objects to the aircraft board.
A survey among passengers has shown that more than 20 percent of them were conscious or unconsciously pronounced by the prohibited objects through the control position of the US government agency Transportation Security Administration on board of the aircraft. At least six percent of passengers entered the aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers claimed that they had lately discovered that they were travelling with guns, ammunition or explosives.
The results of the survey carried out by the Aviation Company Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - and which answered more than 1000 questionnaires - resulted in a higher probability of violation of the rules for younger passengers.
Of the respondents who admitted that they tried to travel conscientiously with the subject prohibited by TSA was 19.7 per cent of passengers with several thousands of hours flying in comparison with less than 15 per cent of the members of the generation X.
Among the most common subjects that have escaped the attention of TSA include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of the respondents were conscientiously exposed to a sharp subject, while 2.2 per cent of women questioned and 3.7 per cent of the questioned men also admitted that they deliberately put drugs on the deck.
The company stated that it was conducting research among passengers around the world in order to determine how many of them were accidentally reported by unauthorized objects through airport control and how intentional it did.
It is not surprising that most of the people who have transmitted unaware objects - whether they are conscious or unconscious - travel in a plane very often.
As the company emphasized, the TSA Directive is slightly complicated and confusing.
People often do not know what fluids and how much they can carry into the plane.
So it is not surprising that TSA has taken the largest amount of forbidden liquid.
For a certain time, people thought that TSA would load with books the same way as with broken goods.
Transfer of liquids is permitted within the country's flights, not international.
Chief of EPA Scott Pruitt on the deferration of planned directives to reduce the emissions of Obama Administration
Once the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by 15 States, its head Scott Pruitt revoked his previous decision on the delay in the implementation of the plan of the former Obama administration on reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt has made changes within his plan, responding so rapidly than previous governments to the needs of national environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal appeal filed against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
This applies to the latest term set out on 1 October when the States should begin to comply with the 2015 Regulation to reduce the quantity of land ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that the agreement would be postponed by one year and ordered a more detailed study of the plan to avoid “related local decisions or threatening economic growth”.
Pruitt, who prior to the role of the head of the EPA President Donald Trump, has served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or restrained the regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industry.
Sudden mediation is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA executor exceeded its authority in attempting to dismiss the integration of Obama's administration plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce the escapes of metan.
In a statement issued on Wednesday night, Pruitt proposed its version of ozone standards and strengthened the commitment of the EPA to cooperate with States through complex processes and fulfilment of new standards in the given timeline.
"After the government of the previous administration of the EPA, she often did not meet the terms and waited to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing with the alignment and further setting of plans," Pruitt said, who in his previous position filed more than a dozen complaints to the EPA.
“We do not believe in regulation through a court dispute and fulfilment of the term we take it seriously.
We never joke about our statute and authority that comes from it."
However, the EPA declaration states that Pruitt may at a certain point use “the possibility of delay and all other legally available authorities” to ensure that the regulations will be “based on healthy policies and the most available information”.
The Republicans in the Congress are pushing for a wider ozone rule.
The budget of the White House approved last month seeks to defer the implementation of the rules of 2015 for at least eight years.
The measures still haven't passed through the Senate.
The New York General Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, who was chaired by the coalition of the countries suing this week, said that the group was not to allow in legal pressure.
"The turn in the EPA views - following our judicial over - is an important victory for health and security of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
The ground ozone arises when normal harmful substances released by cars, power plants, oil raphineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people and thousands of early deaths every year.
Public health defenders and environmentalists suddenly quantify Pruitt's change with thanks.
"It is anxious to develop the pressure to change the mind of responsible persons and protect the air we breathe," Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity said.
"We must continue to compete with the ideological drawing of Trump's administration, which is trying to help pollutants and special interests."
He poured man with acid, but he's not dangerous in court.
You never know what can happen to you.
At one moment you're home with your family and you laugh, and in the other, your whole life will change from bases.
And the worst thing is you can't do anything about it.
Similar destiny met Andreas Christopheros from Great Britain, whose face was stuck with an unknown attacker who was finally released.
The information was introduced by the Web Reuters.
In December 2014, someone knocked at the door at Christopheros.
Andreas lifted up to open.
He thought there was probably a courier who was supposed to deliver Christmas gifts for the family that day.
Instead, he was waiting for a cruel surprise.
The man he never saw in his life, immediately after he opened without warning, he poured acid with words, "This is for you, buddy."
The pain was insignificant.
The clothing fell apart on me as nothing and I felt just an unreal pain on my skin," said Andreas.
The family quickly moved him to the hospital, but there his neighbours learned a terrible report - according to doctors, he had no chance to survive.
A few weeks since the incident, the doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would suffer from infection that threatened to enter his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Of ninety percent, the face that the doctors tried to gather through the skin from other parts of the patient's body was affected.
The great complications for Christopheros have become the loss of eyes.
It's probably the most tormental thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his suffering.
Today Christopheros has twelve surgeries that are not the last.
Acid attacks may require hundreds of surgeons and years of treatment according to plastic surgeons.
Even after difficult and long-term treatment, the victims of the tissue have been scattered for the rest of their life.
"Every time people will not recover and will fight deformation and distortion for life," said Professor Peter Dewulski, speaker of the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
Regarding the attack, Christopheros is sure that a stranger had to mix him with someone.
Because the wrongdoer believed that a man who sexually abused his closer person was a revenge.
The police properly investigated the whole case and searched the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later, the verdict of Christopheros’ family was significantly changed.
"Three judges eventually concluded that the punishment should be cancelled, as a man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
In the past few years, the number of attacks with fat substances has increased significantly.
The Ministry of Interior expressed the issue by planing to establish new instructions to State representatives on the classification of jurisdiction.
They should be included in dangerous weapons.
However, victims of similar attacks are not going to give up.
They demand that the Government of Great Britain prosecute stricter and longer penalties of abduction of freedom to people who attack their surroundings by acid or other cereal substances.
They also require close controls of sales of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in different trades, as these are different cleaning means.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai was burned at night the famous cloudrap The Torch, which belonged to the largest housing buildings in the world.
According to the Dubai civil defence, the inhabitants of the 80th floor building were able to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to the speaker, the Dubai Police of Dubai, fire was fired in the ninth floor and spread up.
However, it was contrary, according to a few residents of the house.
"It started in the 67th floor, so they told us," said one of the mercenaries.
Also, according to another mercenary quoted by the Reuters, the fire exploded in the highest floors and spread down with the falling hot ruins.
We slept.
We've been wakened by the alarm, people were yelling.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," described the events, mercenary George.
Another CNN witnesses estimated that the flames caught about 40 apartments.
At least two cars were destroyed on the ground when the burning parts of the building hit them.
About two hours later, civil defense reportedly managed to control the fire.
The cause of his creation is not yet known.
According to the Witnesses in the surrounding buildings, the electricity went down.
A large fire damaged Dubai the Torch also in February 2015, destroyed over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments all over the building.
Even then, no one had happened, because the inhabitants were able to evacuate in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and then became its 352 metres highest housing building in the world.
The record took him away next year from another Dubai Cloud.
Culturer had 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, the sample of the 30-year-old Ipolita was produced by a pasterous collection of unacceptable funds - from steroids through diuretics to Parkinson's disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix didn't help him with the title, finished fourth.
Culturalists are now threatening four-year distance and criminal persecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, the Italian ragbist Davide Vasta was positively tested on 11 doping substances, which was by then a record quantity in caught sportsmen.
The third-lig player began to take steroids a year earlier when the cultures fell down.
Lucka Vondrackov in Czech Republic.
She hugged herself with a former lover!
The Lucka Vondrackov barely entered the territory of Czech Republic, she's in one bike.
And he also ties attention wherever he comes.
The last time she had fallen in her arms her former lover, Michal Long, with whom she lived for three years.
The actress was 12 years older then and already wanted a family.
Lucia was only 19 years old, and she definitely did not want to hang her career on the scrap.
So they went away, but their friends remained today.
They also have been able to attend a press conference on TV Prima, where they met after a long time.
It's a coincidence that both of them got in blue color.
At first, they did not notice themselves, but then they came close, and Lucia laughed at Michael’s jokes when she was caught in her stomach.
Then they hugged themselves, and the photographers were willingly posted.
But their meeting wasn't a coincidence, because they'll play together a loving couple in the new series of Prima Captain Exner.
Islamists have received for life in Great Britain for the preparation of the assassination.
On Thursday, the British Court sent four members of the Islamic Cell, called the Three Musketeers and the prosecutor planned a terrorist attack against the police and the army.
Four men, of whom two attended a training camp in Pakistan and were convicted for similar acts, were arrested last August.
At that time, the authorities thought he was going to attack directly.
In the car of one of the men, the security agents found partially completed a tube bomb, a knife with signs that in Arabic mean "unbelievers" and a gun design.
It happened at the time the MI5 Secret Service agent put a device in the car.
"The recent assassinations showed what horror the defendants could cause if they were not stopped," said the representative of the Prosecutor Sue Hemming.
Three sentences, aged 28, 25 and 33, may ask for release after 20 years.
The fourth sentenced, who is 38 years old, can do it after 15 years behind the nets.
The men during the trial in London declared they were innocent and the weapons found in the car had MI5.
The court also heard him, but then he rejected the claims of the defendants.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
They measured 38.3 °C in Hodoniya.
Thursday temperature record 37.3 degrees of Celsia remained on top for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees of Celsia, recorded in The Watchtower in Hodoninia, it was overcome by Thursday, which has thus become the warmest day of this year.
It's confirmed by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
On Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records on Thursday.
On Tuesday, the records were overwhelmed or balanced to 35 out of 145 meteorological stations measured over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term stations recorded records of record temperatures.
For example, the Quarter Temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In the Lednici in Brzeclavia, 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum of four tenths of the degree and the current 37.1 degrees in the Pogorelice in Brněnsk exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, just like the Guardian, came from 2013.
There was 10 degrees less in the west.
High temperatures appeared mainly in the south and east of Morava on Thursday.
After the Watch was the biggest heat in Dyjakovic in Znoyemska and Brode over Dyja in Brzeclavska, where the mercury rose at 37.8 degrees, but the record did not overcome.
On the contrary, in the West and Northwest Czech, for example, the fourth highest temperatures were only approximately 22 degrees of Celsia.
"The temperatures have grown there just now afternoon," the meteorologists reported.
Contemporary vegetables in Czech Republic will gradually be distinguished according to the CHMU and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
But most of the places of Morava will remain high temperatures on Friday and southeast of Morava and on Saturday.
China's missing tourists.
Beijing is losing billions because of visa policy.
China has been trying to apply its influence after decades without use of forces.
He will earn $10 billion annually to support language schools and to build universities in abroad, push his entertainment industry to foreign markets and try to attract Western tourists.
But Peking doesn't do that.
The local state media discusses the plan of making the tourism a force of economic transformation and modernization.
However, the number of arrivals increased only 3.8 percent last year and approximately 80 percent of the tourists came to China from Hong Kong, Macaaa and Thaiwan.
It is done, among other things, by the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, China is not welcomed by a foreigner just with open arms, it evaluates the situation in the most common country of the world's economy professor from the Peking University Christopher Balding in the article for the Bloomberg Agency.
The example that speaks for everything is Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa contact with China, the citizens of those other people must take care of visas.
The Chinese authorities in the United States are therefore comparable with the celebration of the new year of China.
The visa cost $140, but if a person doesn't want to wait for a long hour in front, he has to pay $100 and more for additional services.
Such restrictions build significant economic obstacles.
Study Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for visa reduces the number of visitors to the country by 70 per cent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited the land in China, while Hong Kong, who shares less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and lives there less than one percent of all inhabitants, visited 1,8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem itself when the tourist movement uses to achieve its political goals, for example in disputes with Thaiwan and South Korea.
When China restricted the transport to South Korea on spring within a breakdown around the South Korean anti-rake system, the South Koreans repayed it and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell between 42 per cent, while Japan increased by 85 per cent.
It all affects macroeconomic stability.
According to the recent report of the US Central Bank Fed, China could have left up to 190 billion dollars as a result of foreign travels, while China, as part of the sale of currency for tourists, would receive about $35 billion annually.
According to official numbers on the development of the payment balance, China had a 217 billion deficit in the tourism last year, which is equal to 44 per cent of the entire Chinese stay in trade with goods.
So a small number of tourists in the country that is anxious to prevent capital inflammation causes a very painful wound.
However, the nominated factors are only one manifestation of general retention against foreigners.
In many places of China, almost no one heard of immigrants.
In 2013, less than a million foreigners lived in China.
There are more of them in the United States as well as some individual cities.
Even Japan, which is not exactly the crossing of immigration, has a double.
A number of scientific work shows that immigrants usually restore economic growth, business and innovation.
But you can't find them in China.
Solving these problems will be politically difficult, but the step offered is to simplify the visa apparatus.
Other Asian countries, in particular India and Vietnam, have recently developed great efforts to simplify and reduce visa processes.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currency, it should be easier for them to get there.
They multiplied deadly poisonous beaches in the Pluzzi zoo.
The flying Kingdom is able to enjoy three rare, deadly poisonous plasmas.
At the exhibition, the visitors will see only all nine fresh-born Turkish snakes.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at a highest of 2,000 meters.
"It also grows meter lengths," describes speaker Martin Vobruba's zoo.
Youths of the other two species, mortals and red cobras, will still gain strength in the garden farm.
We still can't tell when people will see them.
"We don't want to lose them," said Miroslav's nurse with that it might take a year or two.
The Australian serpent mortals came to the world eight, they are descendants of a pair of breeding origin from the population in Sydney.
"The only person visitors can see in the exhibition belongs to the mortals in the area of Perth," said Voluba, with the fact that in human care, the mortals are required to winter 6-8 weeks at the temperature of 13 degrees of Celsia.
The stoprocent success carried out the snake of the African swimming cobra red.
A pair in the Pluzzi zoo lied out of four eggs of a total of four youths.
"The incubation took 65 days," complemented Vobruba.
This kind in the nature of his victim is shaving the poison to a distance of up to four meters.
He's headed to his eyes, he can cause a lasting blindness.
Youths of all three species are feeding mice holates in the zoo.
In 40 days in the garden, youths are still expected to be leaking from the mamba snow, the eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to the uncertain rescription of the telephone interview, Trump creates pressure on Mexico for payment for the border wall
The U.S. Washington Post issued a copy of President Trump's phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a telephone interview from January 27th with Mexican President Enrique Peñou Netem, Trump urged him to stop publicly reporting that he will not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The American President compromised him that he publicly condemned the construction of the wall, saying, “You cannot speak like this in the press.”
In his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the south borders and announced that he would pay Mexico for it.
The public also escaped the prescription of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbul, revealing an intense exchange of views.
The President Trump told Turnbulle that the U.S. oversight agreement on refugees heading to Australia was "funny" and "bullshit" and insisted that if he agreed on this agreement -- which took up as President Obama's governments -- would look like a "narcotic" after he proposed a ban on the entry of refugees to the United States.
Trump’s call ended after Turnbul explained that “this is my most unpleasant call of the day. ”
Tusk reiterated his testimony at the prosecution for Smolensk.
"He has nothing to worry about," the brother of the dead president, the President of the Government of the Right and justice of PiS Jaroslaw Kaczynski, announced on Tuskov.
"I have nothing to worry, Caczynski will not frighten me," said Tusk and read the current leadership of the country that he is trying to abuse justice against political rivals.
When he left the office of the prosecutor, he waited for Tusk according to TVN 24 crowds scandalled by Donald Tusk! and wished to the politician for 100 years!.
Tusk thanked for his support and assured his conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczynski will not frighten me."
The prosecutors say nothing, but he does not doubt that justice should serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against opponents, opposition or people who do not like, and I fear that I belong to this group.
He was on the interrogation twice.
Expressier was interrogated in the prosecutor's office twice, this time the interrogation was to question the suspicion of the autopsy of the victims of the Smolene disaster.
Furthermore, the body was replaced in the coffins.
The families were prohibited from opening the coffins, and there had to be some reasons for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal because he would burden the Polish-Russian relations.
"The maintenance of good relations at any price, despite such a terrible event, should serve to make Donald Tusk a very important in the EU," Kaczynski said in the Catholic TV Trwam.
He added that the eventual conflict with Russia would have lost Tuskk's chances to gain the most important chair in the Union from which Poland, of course, has nothing.
At the same time, Kachinski declared that he warned the German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it could come to a difference with Donald Tuska, but she didn't realize it.
Tusk has filed an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecutor's office on April 19th.
He did not speak as a suspect at the time, only as a witness.
However, many of his invitation to interrogation considered the part of the obvious efforts of the Polish government and the Chief of PIS Kaczynski to discredit Tuska as a political rival by connecting with various scandals.
The prosecution is subject to the Minister of Justice in Poland, who fulfils the role of the General Prosecutor.
The invitation to interrogation came in a moment after the election of Tuska as the chief of the European Council, to whom Kaczynski tried to prevent, among other things, from visiting Merkel in Warsaw.
Only Polish Prime Minister Beata Sidlová protested on the EU Summit against the extension of the Tuskov mandate.
In this case, Warsaw also left Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban.
Barma and Senegal.
Where can the Czechs vote everywhere?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, the registered voters of power will vote newly on the composition of the House of Barma, Senegal or Lucembourg.
In these and several other countries, since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013, the Czech Republic opened its representatives.
It's from the statement that adjusts the delivery of voting tickets to abroad.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its update, currently in the commentary procedure.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted in abroad.
"From the last amendment of the statement in 2013, there have been some changes to be taken into account in these lists," the Ministry justifies its procedure.
"In some countries there have been new representatives, some authorities have been closed, if possible there has been a change in the level of representation," the material states.
The statement shall contain two Annexes, first of which the representative authorities to which the paper voting tickets are added.
The representativeship of the Czech Republic in the neighbouring countries, Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia, belongs to this group of authorities.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a voting ticket in the press version.
Their list is just changing.
For example, four years ago, the Czech embassy could vote in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Both embassy are closed today.
Czech Republic also canceled its representation in Malayan Bamak and Japanese Kyoto.
There's no choice at the General Consultate in Doneck.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 for the war in the east of Ukraine.
News are on the list of the embassy in Kenya Nairobi, the Senegal capital of Dakar and the Zambian Lusace.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, Czech Republic extended its representation of the General Consultate in Iraq Irbil and Cheng-tu, the capital of the Chinese province S'-chuan.
Voting tickets will also be available for registered voters in the Czech embassy in Burma and Cambodia.
Cheches in abroad had the opportunity to select Members in election rooms at representative offices or consulates yet four times.
Before each election, the State Election Commission shall determine the country for which candidates are voted in a foreign country.
It was the first time in 2002 when it was decided between the South Sea candidates.
In the next two elections, the Czechs were elected abroad between the Southern Czech candidates.
In 2013, the Mediterranean County was elected as well as this year.
The number of Czech voters in abroad is steadyly increasing.
At the Prime Minister 15 years ago, about 3800 people arrived in 2006, about 6700, four years later 8222.
The early elections of four years ago were delivered to the embassy of 10.571 voters.
Massacre on Moore's Ford Bridge: Activists remembered racist linching
Ford Mercury, 1948, traveled around the inhabitants of Monroe, Georgia and kadrcal towards the Moore's Ford bridge.
However, before the four black furniture passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with weapons set him up.
The leader of the group - a medium-aged man in a stripped suit - long pulled out of the cigarette and looked at the forehead glass of the car.
Inside the travellers were shaking with fear.
"We want this N-a Roger!" a man cried.
"Give it to me!"
Silence will interrupt the screaming of a young black man who is pulled out of the seat of a colleague.
Fortunately, this scene is just a reconstruction of events that happened on July 22th.
But when one of the men throws through the Roger's neck the washing, the public is excited.
Since 2005, Moore's Ford returns to the Moore's Bridge regularly a group of activists reconstructing that fate night in 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of Kukluxclan.
No one's been judged for murders.
"It is a miracle that in all these years there has not been one person arrested - even though we still see them in our community; even if we know their identity," said Tyrone Brooks, who helped reconstruction of the event to organize.
"It is a spot in our history and burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old congressman of the State of Georgia and a lifetime warrior for civil rights.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic challenge to do. Every year the community of Monroe reminds that justice was not done enough.
"We demand the prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace in mind and reconciliation, but rather justice," Brooks said.
"The process of healing and reconciliation cannot be initiated until then."
On 27 July 1946, a court doctor covers one of the victims of lynching at Moore's Ford.
According to the FBI's records acquired by NBC News, the lynching was to attend up to 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts.
However, no one has been prosecuted before.
Although suspects remained in freedom for decades, civil rights members claim that both reasons for linching - politics and sex - were known to all the inhabitants of the city.
In April 1946, on the basis of the decision of the Supreme Court, the inhabitants of the black skin of the State of Georgia received the first right to participate in the elections planned for the summer.
And just during the summer elections, according to the FBI, a farmer of black skin Roger Malcom had to stab the land owners of Barnett Hester's white skin -- allegedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, Hester was trading to deal with Malcom’s wife, Dorothy, and brought her to another condition.
According to the statement by the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the significant land owner of the white skin Loy Harrison for Malcom bail of $600.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey in prison.
When they returned from the prison, just before they entered the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects took their way.
"As it turned out, he planned murders and organized Harrison," said the FBI.
"It is also clear that there was a secret agreement between national and local lawguards, not only participating in linching, but also to remove evidence and to cover the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks spoke shorter to the whole matter.
"It was a massacre for election law," he said.
"The murders had a clear subtext for all the local inhabitants of black skin: 'This is how you get if you register and go to vote.'
The annual reconstruction of events at the Moore's Ford bridge organizes almost ten years Cassandra Greene.
Its presentation is picturesque, bound and precise. It shows deeply rooted racism, which many would like to consider extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction is not easy and even more difficult to distract your eyes, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching, because we must face the unpleasant feelings that are hiding in each of us," Greene said.
"But there cannot be a relationship between us unless you hear what I had to go through."
The main tests of this year's reconstruction began in June and immediately the first day, approximately 30 players - twenty white men, the rest of the black - included in the room where Greene met them with a very carefully planned show.
Wade Marbaugh is running an excipient director position.
Many years he played the leader of Kukluxclan, but he said he was exhausting.
"I feel bad about it because it resists who I am," said Marbaugh.
"I think it is very important to remind this part of history regularly, because we never want to return until that time."
Herci Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play the role of Roger Malcom, the Barnett Hester, exercise their roles.
The show begins with a fight - Malcom argues with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get out of my land n-e!"
Rascona can't be done.
There's a fight.
At that point, everyone (but at least every actor of black skin) will explode in the laugh.
Greene's laughing at all.
"What happened?" says Rascona.
He's confused.
Was I too rough?
"No," Greene answers joyfully.
"I just don't think the white men then said 'n-r' in such a tone."
"Precisely," one of the black skin actors squeezes.
"You have to emphasize more on R."
Energy in the room is suddenly better; enemy will replace the sense of closeness.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just so that it's done after four victims of a massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
Rascona this time emphasizes the right expression of the word to N.
No one's laughing now.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Screaming, shooting... and incurred silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of the actors and sings a sad song Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit".
With every word, it feels sad in the room.
At the back of all, about a dozen watchers are wiping sweat and tears out of their eyes.
There are almost the same number of black and white people in the population.
One couple landed from the New York Ethacy, many of the observers from the nearby area.
Each of them endures the local wet climate nearly eight hours and Brooks leads them to Malcolm and Dorsey's graves.
Until this time, murders could be viewed with a departure, but now, standing in the same place where the linching happened, the atmosphere is scary.
With the last words of the song, Greene's crowd will call on the body inspection.
Children kneel to the heads of the victims, watch false blood and immediate bodies and whisper in their ears.
"They're not dead," a little boy's crushed.
He's running out for a few minutes, and Greene's gonna thank the public.
The heroes clean up the rope and wipe out their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, a man in a suit who played the leader of Kukluxclan.
Nick Rascona will hug his two hero friends and cry in their arms, and eventually emotions come on him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know that you have the role.
But you had a reason for that."
Later that day, he'll meet the public together with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple talks about the black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski barely found words that would express her feeling of today’s show.
"It's hard to listen to those ugly words and to look at those ugly acts... that do people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said to reconstruction.
"I am forced to realize that the lynching is still a theme," she added, "only called the police conflict."
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks is sitting in the courtroom, enjoying dinner and talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he has already planned the show for the next year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring, because it describes the fear we had to experience - but it is also a moment to think," he said.
"If we do not learn from who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know or study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it."
I love the instructions to use.
One of my friends says the instructions to use only read the scratch.
I don't agree, on the contrary.
It's one of the modern forms of art, often a real surrealism.
With nostalgia, I remember the past time where the instruction to use anything was rather a rare indication.
So, for example, my first gramophon contained only one paper on which the hieroglyphs showing the involvement of some parts, all of them had some secret marks.
After years, I got something in there, I offered that letter to the chamman who wasn't afraid to slip the backboard.
He advised me with a scratch, what the paper with the charm labyrint is suitable for.
Yes, it was a common tool in the chronic depletion of the toilet paper.
He found an unconnected wire and allowed me to listen to the expensive vinyl cakes again.
The new time has brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit slider, where he just sticked to the grip, required about ten pictures.
Especially, a draft with a description of how to put one piece into the other.
The carriage was two parts and the other procedure was simply not possible.
It was oppositely required by considerable efforts with the need to break certain plastic parts.
My ignorance of the instruction ended at my seat Leon mark.
The year of production 2003 still had a book with the instructions of tiny repairs, including the exchange of blinker lamps.
It was easy.
A total of three steps and the work was to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the instruction mentioned that while the lamp on the right went really to exchange in three steps.
One, cut the cover.
2. Strike out a broken light and screw up the new.
3. Move the cover.
The lamp left had a problem in the form of the location of the battery cover.
At first, I thought that by putting the right top of the car into the car's worms, I would look at some screwed screwing, which would be easy to remove, and then I will be able to follow points 1-3 of the savings author of the service book.
It's a hunch mistake.
The shelter had no place, no space for the sharp hand of Popel, including the obsessive Slezan.
I lost half an hour of my life, totally without any success.
The condition was still strengthened by my wife's entry into the garage, which came from the screaming and words that heard from my mouth completely exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked me unfairly.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, however, if I missed vulgarian terms, there were only two public words left.
I'm changing the lamp.
"And why does it take you so long?" she screwed the sentence that in a long-term bond could be her last.
I slowly explained the problem, with the main emphasis on the procedure of torture of the author of the instruction, where the blessing of the burned iron on the hand, following her instructions to never write anything again, was just a introduction to the wide scale of instructions of Kladiva to the witch, including his commission burning on the top of the Losinian castle.
"What about unmounting the box?" the woman was mounting the battery.
In a clear desperation, the step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that's the day a colleague called me, who was just talking from a collapse state after the two of the National Medicines Office's checking offices.
I know him as a balanced colleague who experienced possible and impossible in the field and who can interpret wild stories by an unexpected voice.
"Don't you imagine I've received a penalty for not hanging the instructions for washing my hands," he told me in a weak voice.
I gradually familiarized the whole problem that was involved in the patient's washing room on the toilet.
His arguments by the Commission official that adults can usually wash their hands and that no need of icons to deal with the common activities of the decent people, had no healing effect and cost him a lot of money.
"It's not just like that," she told him.
He understood that the simple slipping of the hand of the liquid water is a primitive act at the Kromany level that a modern, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
It should therefore be informed that water is needed to be released.
The whole process has a total of 11 points, but at the end, it is a joyful finding that a man washed his hands exactly as he was ordered by the councilman.
Finally, I have to understand that I have been inspired and I'm preparing a detailed plan for the toilet activity.
In the matter of defection, the procedure is united, where the problem will not occur, in urine, in view of certain differences in both genders, it will be necessary to expire the instructions two.
These icons remain difficult because the creation of a perfect procedure means a precise drawing of all anatomic details, which could arise from a certain turmoil visitor to the toilet, despite the event that he can finally find out that he has erased the appropriate opening throughout his life with a completely wrong procedure.
Pearson will release another 3,000 employees and reduce dividend in trying to restore trade
The British Education Group, Pearson, said on Friday, would release another 3,000 employees and reduce the temporary dividenda by 72 per cent in response to another restructuring programme to change the commercial model.
Another wave of release, which, according to the statement by the Executive Director John Fallon, will take place at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, follows the previous decision of the company to release 4000 employees under the previous restructuring.
The Pearson announced a plan to reduce the costs of another 300 million funds (394 million dollars) in May under the third programme to reduce costs in the effort to resurrect the declined trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its share in the Penguin Random House of Bertelsmann, stated that the view for this year remained unchanged after the one-percentage increase of basic sales in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Attack to convoy in Cabul: NATO soldiers were killed in suicide explosion
A suicide assassin attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan Kabulu. At the attack, one NATO soldier died and a few others were injured, officials reported.
Five soldiers and translators were injured, as stated in NATO's statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians died in the city district of Qarabagh.
This month, the Afghanistan bomb attack -- Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in the explosion in the heratic mess.
On Monday, a suicide attacker killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
The NATO stated in its statement that the Tuesday explosion occurred after the patrol and the members of the Afghan Army were attacked by “local person with an explosive device”.
The statement further states that all injuries of soldiers are out of danger of life and are located in the US military hospital at Bagram Air Base.
According to the rapporteurs, the growing power of the Taliban and the groups known as the Islamic State (IS) in the area of Qarabagh is an important source of concern for the unified NATO forces in near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at the first half of 2017, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan, of which 20% of the victims died in the capital city.
At the end of July, the bomb in the car was killed by at least 30 people in the cabulous neighborhood of Shia.
The Taliban signed up for the attack.
On May 31, he killed a large explosion in the center of the city over 150 people. It's the most deadly military attack in the country since the US units had demolished the Government of Taliban in 2001.
Violence undermines such a doubtful situation in Afghanistan, and President of the United States Donald Trump considers an increase in the number of American soldiers who should help military units and police officers in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, suicide attacks he had been exploited by the public's trust in the government in recent weeks, its regulation and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanyn.
In response to the complaint, EPA re-evaluated its decision to dispose of smoking rules
The American Environmental Protection Agency revoked its decision to defer the law of Obama's administration, which ordered States to reduce emissions, just a day after the agency sued 15 States.
In the middle of the night, the EPA notified its decision on the passage of Ozone Standards 2015 by the words that it shall submit the Agency's obligation to cooperate with the States.
"We believe in dialogue with our public partners and we will hear their views," director Scott Pruitt said in the statement.
Pruitt announced in June the EPA efforts to reduce ozone standards - which measure real air pollution in specific areas of the country and on the basis of measurement determine the limits to be met by October 2018.
The group of 15 of the majority of democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a complaint on Tuesday with reason that the EPA negotiations are illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump strives to avoid many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trump's words, in an effort to eradicate economic growth.
However, the efforts of the new government have begun anti-democrats and conservative groups that fear the impact of emissions on public health.
EPA on its web sites states that breathing of air with ozone content “can reduce lung functions and increase respiratory symptoms”, such as astma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnar got a shot and bleeded!
This, in our relatively new singer, you may have already registered in June this year, when this almost unknown singer has arranged for the Czech circumstances of monster action that he has hosted the front personalities such as Karel Gott, Lucia White, Simona Krain, and a number of others, and none other than Leoš Mares.
The goal was simple, to appear to the public and to introduce his musical video to Sarah’s song, whose baptism was just appointed.
But few already know that the filming of the videos that took place in Russia did not go through without problems, and the Ladislav Bubnar himself had to be treated.
It was his first big film with the stars of the Russian national ballet and it didn't go without a real mess.
Sarah's song is very emotional and is based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the dramatics of the scene, he was supposed to indicate a punching punch in the video of the singers' juice.
At one point, however, he hit him so strongly and directly into his nose that a young singer had to be treated by a doctor.
"It was a wound, I didn't expect it, it immediately bleeded out of my nose," Ladislav commented.
Colleagues and producers said that it was an unfortunate accident, and Ladislav failed to respond in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not so serious that it affected the continuation of the next film.
The video of a young artist we're bringing to you now, you can record the scene with a hit.
Undenied blood version, however, was not preferred to be used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasil Lomačenko talked about mutual duel
Vasil Lomačenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could emphasize the most stressful boxing game in a lightweight, first met at the Tuesday meeting.
Each of them was located in a separate room in the offices of ESPN in Los Angeles, while Garcia - the unbeaten champion in the lightweight World Boxing Council - went down to the hall where Lomačenka welcomed, the champion of the World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against the former four-fold world champion Adrien Broner at the Saturday match at Showtime, both boxers got on the list of five best boxers in light weight.
Garcia dragged his right hand and said, "How's it going, champion?
Good luck."
Lomačenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN on Saturday at 19:00.
Boxers post for photographers and manager Lomačenka Egis Klimas adds that the potential fight of boxers would be “perfect test”.
"I'm a former champion in pearl weight," Garcia adds.
“For the fight with Broner (67 kg), I had to pick up, but I'm not so big.
I'm small at my 63 pounds.
I'd like to go back to the category of light weight.
Lomachenko has to get back to light weight... then we can fight.
The fan wants it.
Why don't we do it to them."
Lomačenko agrees.
"Box would be good for this game."
Climas has raised a request for the payment for view - which is part of his strategy. Lomačenko should graduate his debut in lightly weight at the end of this year and next year to fight with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), which also expressed interest in the fight against the duel of Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who struggled on 23 September about the title in light weight in the arena of the Forum.
"The salary should run in the style of paying for view, that is what the fans ask," Garcia, who later expressed that the possibility of sending a game is open through the TV station that comes with the best offer.
"We are the main attraction.
No one else will draw such attention to himself.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia stated that he recognised Lomačenka as a “excellent boxer ” and could take part in his Saturday match.
But Lomačenko didn't get Garcia's praise to collapse when he said that the champion of three divisions from Riverside looks "very slowly... excuse Mike, but you're talking about knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
Boxers said they felt a growing tension in front of each other's duel.
"You will not just forget this game.
There's no other match that doesn't take so much attention.
And I will be very pleased to put in the fire," Garcia said.
Lomačenko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It'll be a great match."
A young couple 12 years ago disappeared without a lead.
They found their car on the bottom of Volha.
Two young Russians, Ilja Žirnov and Kira Čerkasov, were missing since December 2005.
They were extensively searched, but without success.
And the police finally ended up for lack of evidence of investigation.
The family of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they wouldn't know what happened to the couple.
After 12 years, a sad end of the story came.
The wreck of their car was found by a lazy diver on the bottom of the Volha River in Cheboxara, Čuvaska.
Only thanks to the documents left in the car, the police were able to identify a few.
The documents survived a decade underwater, and without them, the police would take much longer to find the identity of the founders.
A couple were last seen when Žirnov borrowed a car from his father so he could pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver that the car discovered remains anonymous.
He announced his finding to the Chiboxar police, which next day pulled the car to the beach.
The investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident caused by a frozen path around the river.
However, the investigation continues, and further details will be published after it ends.
The latest results of the tests to determine the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of asylum asylum tests in Sweden, who were subjected to new methods of assessment of their age, show that over 80 percent of people were questioned as old as 18 years old, but not everyone believes in their precision.
Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (Rätttsmedicinalverket) began new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is a more precise assessment of applicants in the context of the assessment of asylum applications. Measures have been adhered to the measures after the Sweden Migration Agency (Migrationverket) has been criticized for failure in determining the right age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date today, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6880 cases to explore and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests carried out from half March to 31 July 2017.
80% (2002) was estimated as 18 years old, while in the other 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency considered that the questioned was “possibly 18 years old.”
In other 423 cases, the questionnaire was decided to be “possibly 18 years old. ”
Tests are accessed only if the age of the questioned is disputed.
According to Johan G›ransson from the Forensic Medical Agency, the results are corresponding to the previous month.
"In addition to the last month, statistics are held in captured railways and numbers are very similar," said The Local.
The higher number of applicants whose age was estimated to be 18 years old does not necessarily mean that asylum applicants lie about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases “the questioned person is 18 or older”.
The Svenska Dagbladet newspaper investigated 581 public cases and found that in 243 cases, the questionnaire stated that this year he was 18 years old.
The criticism was also expected by a medical method of determination of age, which includes the rentgen of wise teeth and the MRI knee joint scans, followed by dentists and rentgenologists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus from the Karolin Institute, who, among other things, deals with the assessment of the biological maturity of people to determine the age when he passed through adolescent.
"I had reason to think about this issue, and I don't think these types of measurements to assess age are right.
The biological age assessment is in some sense very uncertain.
If we can't determine the age with precision, we should not pretend the opposite," said the Metro newspaper.
The Forensic Medical Agency of the Agency's Gásransson defended the decision by saying: “The risk of the wrong child’s assessment as an adult is generally small.
The highest risk is the fact that the questionnaire is closely under the limit of 18 years, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all questioned."
Trump threatened on the phone to the president of Mexico.
The American President Donald Trump, in the January call to Mexican President Enrique Penya Net, threatened that he would not meet him if he publicly said that his country would not pay for the construction of a wall between the United States and Mexico.
Trump in the interview said that funding would be arranged somehow, even though he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbul.
It comes from the prescriptions of the interviews published by the Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made a wall construction on the south border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his last election campaign.
Right in the first interview with the Mexican President shortly after his entry into the function of Trump Penyu Neta, he was not diplomatically punished for being critical of his plan for building the wall.
He elected the southern neighbour as a growing political problem and pushed the Mexican president not to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this to the press," Trump repeatedly said in the 27 January interview and threatened to interrupt contacts with the Mexican President, if he continues to issue an objective declaration.
They say financing's gonna come up with something, and it's going to work well.
"But if you say that Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to see you anymore, because it's unacceptable to me," said the American journal Trump.
The wall has marked the least important thing we're talking about, but politically, it may be the most important thing.
The executive command for the construction of the wall Trump issued shortly after taking power.
Mexico refuses the construction and funding of the walls of a length of 3,200 miles [3200 km], so the relations of both countries have also been exploited.
In the end of March, Trump said that the project will be paid by the United States.
Finally, Trump first met with his Mexican Proteister at the June Summit of G20 in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also informed Trump's telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbul of January 28th.
The Chief of the White House called the conversation ridiculous.
This conclusion led him to the exchange of views on an agreement that Australia would provide asylum to the Central American refugees in exchange for the United States to adopt persons from international facilities in the Pacific Island States.
Trump first considered the deal stupid, but later he joined it.
"You can definitely say that this is not the agreement you have made, but you will have to stick to it," Trump Turnbull said.
In some passages, a telephone conversation with Turnbulle was almost vital, for example, when Trump appreciated as a good idea of Australian refusal to accept refugees coming in boats.
"You're worse than me," he joked Trump.
But suddenly, the tone of the conversation was sharp.
"I hate taking these people," said Trump.
I assure you they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They will not be great people who will go to work for local milkmen," he said.
In the interview, he also pointed out that the refugee could become an assassin from Boston in five years.
Trump led at the end of January, so nearly a week after his arrival to the White House, telephone interviews with a number of world officials, often a few during a day.
The phone call with Turnbull eventually marked the least pleasant for the whole day.
Before he finished, he emphasized that he had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They executed Rana's killer before the crowd.
Her father was watching.
The execution took place in the Square in Jemen Sana.
Muhammad al-Maghrabbi chose his victim as a little Rana Almatari who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Magrabi abducted a girl, took her to his father's house where he raped her and choked her with his hollow hands.
Then he raped her body, and then threw it near the bag.
The violent death of a little girl affected the whole country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the first row of a thousand - head crowd that gathered to be a witness to the execution.
Muhammad al Magrabi was convicted under the law of the chariya.
The father of the victim after the execution told the media his feelings.
I feel like a reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day of my life.
Even other family members were present, together with the crowd, yelling the password "Let Justice live."
A rapeman brought a police van from which he was pulled out.
The cops tied him up on his stomach.
One of the members turned their weapons against him and fired from an immediate nearby.
The present crowd celebrated every wound that was burned.
Mr al Almatari told the MailOnline website that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"The justice, Allah and the law of the chariya have won," he added.
I stood at the Square of Liberation in Sana, waiting for my daughter's killer to be executed.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ranna's small body and buried him on the nearby cemetery.
Me and my wife Jamileh are grateful that justice has been done.
The police were afraid that the crowd gathered on the square would fall into a hated madness, the killer would fall down and lynch.
The execution was ordered by a court which is under the control of the Shiiti Hutia.
But originally, Magrabi was convicted to 100 wounds by bie, but his act raised such a rebellion that the judge decided for death.
Al Magrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27th.
Ranna's family knew him well.
When the police were searching the basement of his house, they discovered evidence that the man was planning his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a beast.
What could have been his motive?
Even the beast would be more merciful to the wound.
"Our family has no enemies and the wounds that wore Ranna's body were scary," he said to the media.
"The wound disappeared afternoon, and that day we reported it to the police, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, the posters with her photo hanged everywhere," he continued.
Everyone believes the police got a tip from the killers' parents who suspected their son of a horrible crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after she learned that her daughter's body was found.
The wound was playing out with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10 or 15 minutes, I went to see where she is.
We've been looking everywhere, but Rana's gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we looked for nothing.
Inhabitants of Jemen were disgusted by crime and began gathering before the police station where al Magrabi was held, and demanding immediate punishment.
The deputy of the Ministry of Justice read the record of the investigation to calm them down.
The accused did not show regret according to everything.
Just before the punishment was executed, the police read his judgment, but the convicted only looked at his executive.
The whole event was recorded for national television, but a lot of recordings that the crowd had received on the Internet.
Governor of Western Virginia announced the change of the political party
The Democratic Governor of Western Virginia Jim Justice announced on Thursday night at the meeting of President Trump that he was moving to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, Democrats have turned back to me," said Governor Justice.
"I am telling you today after a long prayer and reflection... today as the inhabitant of Western Virginia, I tell you that I cannot continue to support you from the position of the democratic governor."
The crowd of observers exploded in joy.
"I will apply to the Republicans tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another match."
Trump has already promised people to meet in Western Virginia.
Trump won in Western Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the entire country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a great property from his father and owned several coal down.
The value of his property is estimated to $1.59 billion.
At the same time, on Thursday night, the Republican National Committee issued a statement in which it stated: “The struggle of Governor Justice is another wound for a democratic party that will put obstacles to our way instead of making our country up. ”
"For a democratic party that has only 15 governors and controls at least the legislative authorities in history, it is the last drop notification of the Governor of Justice for the already posed party without a leader who seeks to find positive and unified reports," stated President RNC Ronna McDaniel in his statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises the "real" apologies to Russia for the doping scandal
The former excellent sportsman Sebastian Coe commended Russia on Thursday for a sincere apology for the doping scandal, but repeated that it has not yet been the right time to return Russia to the sports world.
The Russian athletic chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the occasion of the IAAF convention - which took place at the night of the MS at athlete - that the expulsion of his country from the sports world was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all athletes who thus lost gold and silver medals. ”
Despite its comments, the members of the IAAF Congress voted for the reservation of a ban which entered into force in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report showed that Russia supported the doping of its sportsmen.
"I think we were witnessed today with very sincere answers and presentations," President Sebastian Coe told journalists.
"All members of the Council and the Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia admitted its mistake and worked from all the powers to fix and renew the right function of the entire Federation."
Coe said he was also “happy” that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has been very successful and we have taken a further step, but the Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis headquarters to preserve the penalty that was thrown into Russia," Coe added.
"In the nearest months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our efforts were always to separate honest athletes from the unfair," he finished his speech.
The MS athlete starting Friday in London will compete under the neutral flag of 19 Russian athletes who have fulfilled strict rules of IAAF.
The Chief of the Crisis Office of IAAF Rune Andersen said Monday that Russia still has to fulfil several criteria before it is allowed back.
The drug presence tests are still unsuitable and the exclusion of coaches continue to operate their activities, he said to the reporters in London after the end of the presentation of the IAAF Council.
The CzechTrade state order was obtained by Francesk Savova, whose country is pursued.
The public procurement of the CzechTrade State Transport Agency was obtained by the Young Front Front France Savova.
The officials gave him 100 per cent of the points in all quality criteria.
They didn't mind the Czech state pursuing Savov for tax fraud and requesting his publication to Czech Republic.
In April, the CzechTrade Ministry of Industry and Trade produced a four-year public procurement for the BusinessInfo portal.
The total procurement of 30.8 million crowns was obtained by the Manufacturing Young Frontisk Savova.
In 2014, the Czech Police accused it of tax escapes and has been prosecuted to escape.
Savov fled to Great Britain and Czech Republic asked for his publication.
On the case, the server currently warned.cz.
According to the original CzechTrade criteria, the price offered from 60 per cent and from the remaining 40 beauty competitions, i.e. the quality of the project.
The second criterion has been significantly helped to Savo’s company.
According to the information, it received 100 points in all partial criteria of quality.
As a result, she was moved before another candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with a amount of 404 900 crowns a month, VLM offered 324 350 crowns.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it obtained sub-mediate evaluation from the estimaters in all quality criteria, total of 62 points.
The BDO Advisory and Digital Agency R-Media, which falls as the server Currently.cz, under Economy's publication, participated.
The VLM issued several objections against the result of the tend, considering its assessment NZs unfair and insufficiently justified.
After their rejection, the competition was decided to be attacked by the Office for the Protection of the Competition of UOHS.
He believes that ChechTrade was acting in contrast with the law.
"The applicant is convinced that the contractor has made a decision to choose a public contract supplier on the basis of the risk of the subjective evaluation, a clearly favourable participant of the Young Front, a.s., on the cost of the proposal and other suppliers," the proposal for the initiation of the proceedings submitted to the UOHS this week, which has published the server Currently.
According to the Director-General and Chairman of the VLM Michal Clima, the pointing pointing of the electoral committee appears to be an incredible and 100 per cent assessment of the Young Front Project in all its members as exceptionally suspected.
"Each independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspected," he stated for the Current Climate.
ChechTrade has not expressed the situation yet.
The CzechTrade Agency does not generally comment on public orders before they are closed.
Any information about your procurement is published in the Profile and in the Public Procurement Reporter in accordance with the law.
"When the order is complete, a full written report will be published, however, during the duration of the contract, we cannot express ourselves to its progress," said the median representative of the agency Stephan Long.
The young front responded to the statement that it considers extremely problematic that the issue of the Economy has struck a member in the current.cz competition where it has its own business interests.
However, this fact was mentioned in the article.
In the tend, it could have helped her that she was the one who provided the BusinessInfo editorial service portal in the previous four years.
The procurement was first in 2013 when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led Martim Kuba ODS.
France Savova blames the police for tax escapes in relation to the excessive VAT calculation of its companies, which caused the Czech state alleged damage to up to 770 million crowns.
Czech Republic has asked the United Kingdom for its publication since 2014.
According to Savov, his criminalization boss, ANO Andrej Babish, under which the Mafra's issue is under the influence.
The London Court rejected the appeal against the issue last year, but the entrepreneur renounced.
"From our views, the case has not gone anywhere from last year, and from Great Britain we have not yet received any understanding in the issue of the judicial power of the judgment," stated the speaker of the Prague city state representation, Stephanka Zenklová.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Front, Savov in the company Harvestor Limited, with a seat in Cyprus, which controlled the Českobuderian beerware Samson, and in the Cyprus company Maraflex, which is profiled as a investment fund, buying in dangerous assets.
He should also control the disrupted Heavy Machinery Services, before Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also connected to acquisition of property from somewhere the Socialist Youth Union.
The engineer was walking through the tracks and the park, ended up in the bowls.
The engineer drew attention to the streets, walks and park roads in Ushovic.
When the patrol began to persecute him, he decided to go to the Statue.
"The men's cops with increased caution persecution by the city when on one of the sideways from the Marian Lázines he failed to manage and entered the motorcycle to the field where he crashed," said police spokesman Daniel Dvořák.
Eventually, an ambulance helicopter had to fly, which transported the injured motorcare to the hospital.
Following, the police found that the engineer's own driver's license, the registration marks on the motorcycle were discarded, its production number was ripped out and the product label itself was removed.
It's so possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to another investigation.
"The respiratory test was excluded at the site of alcohol in the driver, but the test found a positive result for the substance of metamphetamine," the police speaker added.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's movement to Paris
The rules limiting the funding of European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's record transmission from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalization for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by the EUFA organisation that supervises European football teams and has the power to prohibit the teams' participation in the prestigious Liaison of Masters.
The rules of financial fair play (FFP) which introduced EUFA in 2011 determine that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transmission was not financed without great losses.
Barcelona paid EUR 222 million only to buy Neimar from his contract and Neymar will require a payment of a few dozen million dollars a year.
There are several financial conditions of Neymar's transgression to France.
Since the PSG team is financed by a wealthy Qatar family that has enriched energy sales, it can afford Neimara to bring into such a star football family.
Clubs can spend a huge amount of money for the shopping of players, but on the other hand they must prove legal sources of revenue, which allows them to cover direct costs of the football business activities.
The FFP introduced Michel Platini after reaching the chair of Director EUFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that the clubs that were owed after new reinforcements are cheating and risking bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to ensure them.
In 2011, FFP directed its attention from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the commercial model Roman Abramovic used with Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and wasted the horent sums for players y to build a global mark - suddenly it was not so advantageous.
During the current three-year testing period ending in 2018, clubs can demonstrate the loss of EUR 30 million.
And despite that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Alexander Cheferin is determined to defend the ban of excessive expenses.
"The FFP laws are still valid and we are determined to strengthen them in the future," stated last week for the Associated Press Andrea Traverso, who observes compliance with FFP rules.
Although the PSG paid the amount for the purchase of Neimar in a single payment, it can discharge the amount for the purposes of the accounting at the whole length of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be scheduled to EUR 44.4 million a year for five years.
The first wave of the highest sanctions of the FFP hit PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, owned by Abu Dhabi.
The PSG paid a penalty of EUR 60 million (82 million) which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and the order to reduce the men of the League of Masters to 21 players in the season 2014-2015 instead of 25 players.
EUFA takes note of teams that can try to circulate financial regulators by increasing their revenues through club owners.
Therefore, even though the caterian company is sponsoring PSG, as soon as funding exceeds the value of the standard market rate, EUFA has the right to prohibit the calculation of the amount.
In 2014, the EUFA decided that the amount of the funds provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
Part of Neymar’s revenues in PSG could, according to some reports, be retained from the MS organizational commission at football 2022 in Katar.
However, PSG and representatives of MS 2022 in Kataro rejected fat that Neymat should become ambassador of MS in football and that such maneuver would easily be revealed by UEFA actors.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that EUFA will carefully monitor any attempt to circulate the rules,
According to the Tuesday statement of dedicated persons, EUFA has not launched any investigation in the case of Neimara's transfer to PSG.
The source of this report wished to remain anonymous, since the PSG situation was not authorized to comment, the Agency The Associated Press stated.
The latest published accounts show that the PSG closed the year 2015-2016 with a net profit of €10 million and turning EUR 542,4 million.
The accounting conclusions for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neyama's arrival to be an enormous opportunity for sponsors, merchandise and sale of coats.
The contract's signing club promises an increase of up to 30 per cent.
The representatives of the Spanish Leagues, apparently concerned about leaving one of the greatest stars, were trying to lose Neymar's departure, argumenting that PSG would violate the FFP rules.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" of the club and the state," said President La Ligy Javier Teba for the Spanish newspaper AS, refering to the ownership of the PSG Club by the Qatar Syndicate.
The manager of Arsenale Arsene Wenger, whose club owns an American sports magnat, shares the same position of La Liga on the financing of the club.
"It is the consequence of property that has changed the football world from bases in the past 15 years," Wenger heard on Thursday.
"When the club becomes the owner, everything is possible.
Following the rules of the financial fair play is very difficult, because the State may have various interests in the participation of such players in its club."
Sparty booker Russian: Changes are painful, but we must believe.
Sixteen thousand applause fans on their feet.
Tomasz Rosian's going to the square.
The same scene as the Sunday fight against the Bohemians.
The sports carrier was moving against the Red Star game, inventing a few goals, but his fellow players did not go to the black.
The summer team pumped by new multi-million forces so after the introduction of the biennium in European cups ends.
Was it hard to do anything else with the fight after the Belgrade Gate?
After the naked goal, four shots had to be shot, which was hard for us.
At least we wanted not to lose, to raise our self-consciousness, so that we should be able to turn away from other matches.
We had some chances.
We need to work together as a team and move our game.
Why didn't Sparta get into the fight so long?
The game is a lot worked out.
The combinations of the rivals were much better than ours.
We didn't get to anything. We shot half time later.
Of course, that's very little when you have to win two or three goals.
The second half of the time was much better, and in the final third, we were able to play with them.
But you have to push the rivals more often in such positions.
Is the problem with a large number of changes in the system?
Of course, it's one of the pains when a new man is formed.
We only played three competitive matches, and the composition is still changing.
It's about the coach to find an ideal eleven that's sitting down.
Is it encouraging you that you have already played parts of two matches after you?
They're still just parts of the struggle.
I don't know how my condition develops and when I can finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that happened in Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise we can't.
It's the same thing as injury.
If you don't believe, you can't come back.
Sparta has decided somehow, we must be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be worse.
The fans came again in a large number, but they left in distress.
What can you tell them?
There was a remarkable visit again, just like with Godmaka.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy as a better performance.
Show something they're coming for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember visits like that when I played here 15 years ago.
Can it be a season without cups at least a benefit for the league?
So far, we're fighting each other, we're playing, so it's not such a advantage for us.
For extreme tax escape, the entrepreneur will stay ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of the entrepreneur of Jiri Toman, who is supposed to take a substantial amount of taxation in prison for ten years.
The numbered damage is 645 million crowns.
Toman claimed in complaint that justice violated his fundamental rights, the effective findings of the courts in Zlina and the Olomouca said they were incomplete.
However, the constitutional judges indicated the complaint as unfounded, CTC found from the court database.
The U.S. is not another appeal court.
"The fourth instance cannot be assessed by acts or legal doubts that are allegedly permitted by the general courts if they do not represent violations of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution states.
Toman was judged as a fugitive.
The verdict is authorised since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Justice in Olomouca.
At that time, Toman was in a publishing detention in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, he was located even at the time of the US decision.
The penalty stored is on the upper border of the legal rate, which, according to the verdict, corresponds to the damage incurred.
The Supreme Court has identified the case as a extreme tax escape which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man worked in 2005-2008 as chairman of the World Service.
The damage of 645 million crowns only occurred from January to July 2008, the total escape according to the expert exceeded a billion.
However, for processing reasons, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the entire amount.
According to the charge, the World Service did not include all the invoices in its tax confessions.
Instead of monthly VAT and consumption taxes, at least tens of millions of crowns paid taxes in just hundreds of thousands.
World Services and some companies with which the company was dealing have a relationship with the businessman Radomir Elector, whom justice measured for VAT machination in the 13 years of prison.
The Constitutional Court also rejected his complaint before time.
"The Summer of Unlife" and "Comrade Detective" play nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for figures from the famous 1980s; and for the filthy 1990s (when the genius David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced on MTV comedial sketch "The State"); and, of course, for the modern time, 2001, the stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Ruddd have run into larger projects.
As a cultural artefact, it is a light parody and at the same time the embodiment of our modern facebook era of permanent memories.
From the look of francs, it seems like someone's breathing.
The series “First Day of Camp” worked surprisingly well - not only thanks to the absurd humor (example can be a story of a speaking plitter with vegetables that H. Jon Benjamin talked to).
The authors distracted from the main funny point - the middle-age actors who play teenagers of burned children - and they couldn't get rid of the previous events.
The continuation of “Ten Years Later”, in which adults play, do not push so much on the emotional level and satira is very sporadical, including the parody on thrillers of the 1990s as the “Ruke on the Wheel.”
At one point, the figure will be found on the bunch of the Apple Powerbook, the wheels and the “shore of other things from 1991”.
Many of the main stories lines are repeated.
The goodhearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, has not yet moved over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention a mad confusion that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), inspired by George H. W. Bush (very well-employed by Michael Ian Black).
As always, they're the best part of francoise many side stories.
Especially fun is to watch forever young Rudd with long hair alias the character of Matt Dillon from the movie Youth, whose once respectful character of Andy is now an old paprika.
France could start the moments of random madness, such as the returning series Seven Up, until it reaches what I assumes to be logical: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when in the last stage, the whole group turns out to the premiere "The Years to Live".
"Comrade Detective" in Amazon, while appealing to another type of nostalgia: revivalism of cold war to the series "So normal Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde: No regret" and even the series "GLOW", in which the eastern and Western wrestling scenes are facing.
The Creators' comedy of Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanaka in directing Rhyse Thomase is to act as a television inspection: a drama of two Bucharest policemen from Romania in the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism in the way of marxism-lennism.
The main roles - the grinded Gregor and the idealist Iosefa - play Florin Piersic Junior and Corneliu Street, which were contributing to the English language Channing Tatum (productive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more.
In some jokes you laugh (e.g. police watching chess on TV - parodie to American football).
The series was rented by many famous actors -- among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny.
But "Comrade Detective" is too focused on an incredible propaganda drama -- which also includes a killer with Reagan's mask -- and it also looks like it.
Six long episodes are too distracting and comedial moments are not enough.
At a shorter stage, a propagandist satir in "Comrade Detective" could work, such as in a scene where Gregor and Iosef visit the U.S. Ambassador, in which two fats swallow hamburgers on a large bunch.
The clear message for the imaginary communist population is that the Western culture can turn everything into food and orgy.
The idea of Romanian creators was not wrong: we do so with our own culture, as with their own.
The Russian athletes did not wait for the cancellation of the IAAF launch ban.
The International Athletic Federation of IAAF at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban of russian racer launches due to the State supported by the Doping Programme.
The voting in the history of the World Championship, which begins Friday, was very clearly expected.
166 delegates were spoken for the prolongation of the ban, only 21 votes were against.
The main reason for rejection is the fact that Russia cannot meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as set out before the congress, by the chief of the Special Investigation Group of IAAF Rune Andersen.
His group recommended that the ban continues.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been heard and coaches still work in the country with a scratched reputation.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is not yet fully functional.
RUSADA, however, can be tested under the supervision of foreign experts and the British antidoping agencies.
"If progress has been made, there is still much more to do," IAF President Sebastian Coe said.
The Russian athletic Federation was suspended in November 2015, so Russian athletes lost, inter alia, the last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
In spite of the ban on the coming MS, 19 Russians who have previously proved that they have been tested outside the Russian antidoping system.
But at the championship, they won't be able to start in national colors, and they won't play Russian hymna.
The Bank of England will maintain the interest rate of 0.25%
The Bank of England should, as expected, notify that the interest rate would remain unchanged, following the inexplicit economic growth and the weakening of inflation that suppressed speculation on rapid growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will continue to remain “in the background” in relation to maintaining interest rates - despite the expectation of family budgets.
Political actors of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England voted six to two to maintain the interest rate of 0.25%. The results of the voting for an increase in interest rate have supported the inexplicit economic growth supported by weak growth.
In its annual inflation report, the Bank predicted growth to 1,7% in 2017 and 1,6% in 2018 and warned that the reduction of family budgets would continue. The Bank expects the inflation to increase on the autumn to 3%.
At the same time, the Bank pointed out that in the next few years there should be a growth resulting from the inflation caused by Brexim and also stated that the rental from movements should increase more on the financial markets than expected.
The members of the Committee also voted for the withdrawal of a part of the mammal package, which was aimed at supporting the economy and which was introduced in practice a year ago as a response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, it should start paying the Plan of Terminated Financing, which will offer cheap funds to the banks, even though the Bank of England stated that, in contrast with the planned 115 billion £, it will now offer a 15 billion £ less.
Just before the decision, the bank stated: “MPC predicts that a gross domestic product (GDP) will be stagnated in short term with pressure on real domestic income and burden of consumption.”
On the topic of the rate, the bank said that it would be necessary to "track the removals of monetary policy" to calm the inflation, which is "to a higher extent" than the markets are expected.
The markets currently predict the first growth in the third quarter of the next year and further increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any growth would be "free" and "limited".
The Bank reduced the forecast of growth for this year and next year compared to 1,9 % and 1,7 % in May.
The expected growth in 2018 valued 1,8 % remained unchanged.
After the release of the estimates, the pound dropped against the dollar and euro.
The pound dropped by 0.5% to $1.31 and by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to preserve the current state came after the disappointment increase buried hopes for further growth - GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter, compared to 0.2% of the previous three months.
The increase with high probability will remain to 0.3% in the third quarter, although by the end of the year the bank should be slightly increased.
The latest inflation report is an unnecessary comfort for households affected by rising inflation and miserable increases in salaries. The Bank stated that the situation will be worse before growth.
The report further states that the monetary policy “does not prevent” the reduction of income in the nearest years, but it is expected that payments will be “explicitly” to the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also increase because of the great interest in British goods due to a weak pound, which compensates the lower percentage of consumer expenditure.
This decision came a year after the rates were reduced to 0.025% in August last year in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, which resulted in the decline of libraries.
The Bank estimates that the total unity of prices and economy will take at least four years.
Before the decision of the Bank on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates along with an increasing inflation that increased the pressure on the household. Three political actors demanded a 0.5% increase in June.
The inflation last month fell back to 2.6% of June 2.9%, even though the bank stated that it was expected and that inflation should rise again during the next month.
The Bank stated that the crossing relative to 2 % of the target was “a total” as a result of a weak libra.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “In view of the recent fall of swap rates, the competitiveness in the hypothetical market will only rise as soon as the creditors begin to compete for contracts with a view to a good view by the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who are ending the existing contracts and reimbursements - in the offer, there are options without fees, as well as low rates that they acquire in favor."
NHS prescribes controversial HIV medicine to 10,000 patients
Patients receive access to “transformatic” treatment for HIV prevention from September on the basis of the decision of the Supreme Court on the financing of NHS.
The English National Health Service (NSH) announced that a pre-exposure pill of prophylaxis (PrEP) used before sex and reduced the risk of infection in highly risk patients to 86 per cent will be offered through health services for approximately 10,000 patients within the three-year test period.
NSH agreed to finance the test period after the Court of Appeal supported the decision of the High Court of Last year, expressing that NHS has funds for the refund of the PREEP, despite the declaration that the medicinal product should be financed by local authorities.
The decision notified on Thursday was adopted by the NHS of England from the mouth of the Director-General Simon Stevens as “significant intervention”, while he described the decision as“deciding moment”.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to be accepted by patients. The other clinics will be joined in October and by April 2018 will be fully implemented throughout England.
Pre-exposure of prophylaxis (PREP) is a HIV medicine given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PREEP significantly reduces the risk of transmission of HIV among patients in danger.
Pre-sex-related PREEP means that enough specific medicines are available in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Among tested patients include homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and HIV positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinics shall identify eligible participants who sign the consent to the participation of the testing, including men, women, transsexual people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered in GP in Great Britain can also log in to their local sexual health clinic and to take potential participation in testing.
The programme comes by taxpayers on 10 million £ and NHS England signed this week a treaty to distribute medicines after obtaining an international public procurement.
The test period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PREEP, its targeting, use and implementation.
Simon Stevens added: “This important intervention should complement and fully exhaustive and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another millennium in an over 30-year attempt to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health."
Deborah Gold, Executive Director of NAT (National Aids Trust) said: “We are witnesses of the decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PREEP is administered properly and in danger to patients, it offers an opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
NSH will offer from September to patients who are exposed to a high risk of HIV infection a new powerful instrument that is individually controlled and is not required to talk to a partner, which will improve the quality of many lives.
We are pleased to accept this statement.'
Ian Green, Executive Director Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “Priority number one must be a quick testing in the entire country; we must ensure its availability to each patient.
Now we have a test medicinal product PrEP and we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people who are threatening HIV infection."
Shadow Minister Shadow Health Shadow Hodgson said: “The beginning of the test period PrEP is a welcome and long-expected change after months of delays and detention from the government.
The evidence suggests how transformative this medicine can be part of our access to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life threatening infection.
The following tests will bring us a step closer to the full understanding of PREEP benefits.
Now it is important that we start the tests as soon as possible throughout the country and protect those who are exposed to HIV and thus end the spread of HIV in society."
Life on high legs: inter floor and smart design transformed this small apartment to Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with real estate passion, exchanged a large house in 2014 in Knightsbridge for an apartment to Earls Cour.
It is located in the first floor of the smart Queen Anne terrace - and is a remarkable display of modern design that uses the maximum available space.
"Before I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in the Knightsbridge quarter," said Joanne.
"I was looking for something more reasonable.
I ran into this apartment at Earls Court and I had the same height of the ceiling.
I fell in love with him right now, and I slipped on him the same day."
Since then, an apartment of 1,000 square meters has passed complete renal.
A single room apartment with complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add deposition spaces and inter floors to use the high ceiling.
"I thirsted for a high ceiling, big windows and a lot of light.
These were my requirements," she said.
For this purpose, she hired Erfana Azadi from the design and design study of Duck & Shed with a situation in Notting Hill and used a nearly four-metry ceiling to create a home, which was not just a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such altitude that two spaces would rise over itself - the challenge for architects was to create an inter- floor on which you could walk straight.
Erfan had to involve his creative thoughts.
"The steel structure is entirely complicated," he explained.
"We had both spaces to be arranged so that we could walk straight.
It was not only to build a simple platform, but also to turn the steel structure in the right height above and under the ceiling."
This arrangement enabled Erfane to build two full rooms on it - and at the same time add to dramatics.
In the interior, he watches the beautiful living room of an old copper window frame in the design of Retrouvius.
Mirror furniture in golden color, silver lines and retro mirrors Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in dramacy, space and lighting.
A short hall is mirrors on both sides and looks so long.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window in the next room.
At the front doors, storage spaces are stored by mirrors to store appliances and glasses.
The advantage of a living room that borrows the impression of a significantly larger space is to separate it from the kitchen if it is not used.
The compound kitchen is nothing new.
However, what is unique in this solution is a compound of doors.
“We had to solve the technical site”, says Erfan on the exhausted respiratory doors.
"The doors are treated against the weight to be very easily disconnected."
Thanks to smart use of space and storage spaces, Joanne got another 16 square meters, the second room and a better total placement.
"If this happens, what you sell is a dwelling area - or appreciation of your property," Erfan said.
“The real merchant, in fact, calculates its price on the basis of the housing area when entering the apartment.”
In this case, the housing area has been increased in preserving quality materials that provide the space for luxury appearance.
"The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional relationship with home," Erfan added.
"You don't love the divorce of electricity in the walls.
Yes, they're important, but your hearts don't get it."
As it turns out, quality design and elevation of the living area can transform the ordinary apartment into a special work.
And just like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States are disturbing.
Cultural and political ruin between blue and red countries is deepening.
California has declared the prohibition of the travel of its citizens to Tennessee and other seven States.
The Tennessee state repaid it to her and announced a reservation for her citizens to California.
Of course, it is not a ban in full sense, because US citizens can travel freely throughout 50 States.
It is that California has forbidden the provision of state money for its citizens' travels to eight other countries, such as Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this crazy?
California is strong for LGBT and any expression of disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle considers discrimination.
However, Tennessee has accepted the law on the exemption of conscience that therapist who has a moral problem with therapy of patients from the LGBT community has no obligation to provide it to them, but it is obliged to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have adopted laws, according to which religious charity organisations that have received children from mothers after birth to adoption do not have the obligation of these children to adopt the same sex couples.
California has forbidden the financing of the ways of its citizens to the eight states of the Union from its funds.
In practice, it means that California professors must not have ways to scientific symposies, for example, in Texas, paid from their universities, because they are co-financing by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to the tournament or competition, for example, to Tennessee with financial support of their schools.
They must either get federal grants, but it is absurd that the federal government finances the ways of citizens from state A to State B or private sponsoring.
The State of Tennessee came to patience, and its Parliament adopted the law with the resolution that it also dislikes California's high tax policy, high state expenditure, high deficits and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but still in California, it does not wave the travel embargo.
He puts them in revenge for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to each state of the Union, which would order a similar ban on travel for any reason.
At the same time, he invited Parliaments of all States to stop this madness.
The facts, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, it's all constitutional, nothing is constitutional.
States have the right to accept the laws on the exemption of conscience, as well as to decide what their money will go and what they cannot do.
Secondly, what's wrong with your conscience?
If the messenger has a religious problem selling pigs, why can't he only offer beef, lamb, poultry, and fish?
Why would he be forced to sell pigs under sanctions when the messengers offering pigs are enough?
In Colorado, one baker faces an antidiscriminatory lawsuit and high penalty because he refused to bake a cake for a homosexual wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why don't you punish him and leave the cake and order him with hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the Federation are guaranteed, but individual States can make internal, domestic policy in the powers that are not federal, adjust according to their preferences, i.e. by their people.
Then there is diversity, diversity, diversity.
California may be California and Texas may be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT communities once legally pursued tolerance to their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community are following the rules of living and letting all reasonable people live, but some activists do not strive for tolerance against themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance against others.
According to them, no one should ever show moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with LGBT’s lifestyle, and if he does, he should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is total.
They're the new enemy of freedom.
Fifth, I don't know the situation in the American history when the States have done this because of political issues, except for the only case.
Even at the time of the fight for the civil rights of black people, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and South on the side of segregation, the States did not sanction themselves.
This was the only case in the 50th century, the political cause was slavery and declined to the war of the North against the South.
Of course, it will not happen now, but the situation is toxic.
The cultural and political ruin between the blue democratic and red republic states is deepening and the United States is mentally dissolving.
Unauthorized agitation.
The critician Putin got a fat penalty.
The Russian opposition politician Alexej Navalny was sentenced to 300 thousand rubles for violating the rules of campaign before the presidential elections, which will take place next year.
The court sentenced him for calling people to participate in illegal demonstrations.
In the last two months, Navalny organized two major anti-governmental street protests and announced that he wanted to be head of the State in March next year.
The official head of Kremlu Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house in the morning and took him to court.
He gave him a penalty for calling for demonstrations through videos located on the YouTube website.
The penalty is 3,000.
"We'll take them out of the judge's salary later," a critician of Kremlu joked on Twitter.
The Russian Election Commission has recently concluded that Navalny cannot participate in the presidential elections because he was previously convicted of fraud.
However, Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, considers the relevant judgment politically motivated.
The penalties of 300,000 rubles, let's take 25,000 rubles from the court on Thursday also put two members of the Naval Pre-election Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalny entered Russian policy as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant personality in a broken opposition scene.
The officials are trying to defend the Naval in the campaign.
In February, he was convicted to a five-year sentence for stealing a forest company of Kirovles.
In May, the verdict confirmed the appeal court.
The judgment is so powerful that the Naval under Russian law prevents the candidate.
Brothers fight for an empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers are now, more than four decades after the establishment of the empire by their Italian family, dragging over one of the most expensive Victorian real estate in value of over $500 million.
Former director Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis stays at the Toorak board, only three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has a dispute about common property and business property until the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business in 2014, but a sharp dispute is constantly confronted with the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna owned a total of 38 properties worth more than a half billion dollars. The first shop bought the family in 1973 at Smith Street in Collingwood.
This is where Westco Jeans founded the family, which grew into a chain of 160 stone stones.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
For money they bought other properties and the portfolio of the De Lutis family now includes offices, construction lands in Brunswick and Sorrent, apartments on Gold Coast and Mt Buller and business centres in the suburb.
Paul owns approximately one third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who is according to Paul’s words “significant force and dominant personality” of the De Lutis family, owns less than two thirds of assets.
The court records state that Colin owns property worth $316 million, while Paul manages property for $176 million.
For Paul, it has just become difficult to divide property and funds.
"Colin's proposal has made a substantial statement in my eyes," Paul wrote in a vowing statement at the court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts of peace, the first meeting of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers now also compete to who will control the existing business - from which Paul, according to his statement, cut off by Colin.
Colin resists that it's not true and accuses Paul of the wrong loading with some property.
In the previous oath statement, Colin said he believed in an excellent solution to the conflict.
"My Italian origin tells me that the family is the most important thing," he wrote.
Costs for the judicial process are increasing. Thousands of pages of oath declaring, e-mails and messages from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, flood lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC and the defendants of both parties.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and flavors since the 50s of the 20th century and in the 1970s they bought a trade in Brunswick.
For money obtained by stopping property, they bought property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when Westco was founded “in the last year of high school, Paul was still a small, approximately 10 - year - old boy. ”
Anna De Lutis said that, along with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of property to sons would take place for good.
"Luigi often said that he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
Another two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the group of De Lutis family. Colin said that Mark was compensated for a amount of $10 million when he left.
As Paul said, Luke and Mark were “not satisfied with the conditions of their financial compensation. ”
Colin has been standing back since then, despite the fact that he is a former member of the AFL Club, as he stated in his autobiography of 2015 Eddie McGuire, the famous television person and the best friend of Colin.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin answered through a text report in which he stated that, given the fact that the dispute is addressed before the court, “I have nothing to add to it”.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to deal with the whole matter before the court," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, in one of the statements at the Court of Justice, Colin stated that he tried to adapt his brother's requirements.
"Our father would be very unsatisfied if he saw our current situation," he said and added that "he still hoped for an old solution."
On Friday, all hopes were unseen.
"Our disputes will be resolved in a rapid time of trial," Colin wrote.
Cheese in Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
The MHD drivers familiar with water and summer clothing.
At the Maternal School at Chodovca in Prague 4, where about 35 children are now going out only this morning.
The school is after the reconstruction, and the planted trees do not provide a big shadow yet.
There's no pool there, but the teachers shower the kids in the fog.
This afternoon, children remain in classes where the stomachs and curtains are withdrawn.
The air is trying to cool the clean air because they have no air conditioning.
It's also difficult for teachers and cookers.
"The temperature, which is in the interior and outdoor, exceeds hygienical limits for maternal schools, so we should not actually have an open operation in this period," said Miloslava Makovicová.
There is a glass corridor in which temperature is moving about 40 degrees.
We're winding up in the morning after 6:00. They'll close the windows, and we're on the southern sides of the tubes we're protecting.
"But it won't help much," she added.
Better conditions have in the forest school on the Road in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time out there.
We have grown trees on the land, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful nut there, a table underneath it, and we do things there," the Director of the School of Barbora Compan wrote.
The teachers try to go to the forest with children, where there is a larger cold.
The baby's wet hats and the program has different games with water.
"We have a hand-pressure stretch that is used for flowers, and we use it to shower children," Compan said.
Also, the director of the Maternal School at the Novoborská Street on the Prague average Jitka Vilimovska said that the teachers are trying to keep their children in the shadow and digging them with water.
"We have a relatively grown garden, so there are trees," she said.
He's walking out in the morning and after 15:00.
Every child has to have a head cover.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
For example, they can choose little sweet tea or red juice and have water drinks in the garden.
They also eat vegetable salad and eat fresh fruits and vegetables sometimes produced by their parents.
"Maybe today, a mom brought here about a dozen mills for children," said Makovic.
The drivers get water or summer crew.
The Prague Transport company DPP shall provide them with water, ion drinks or summer steams in hot days.
The tramway and bus cabs are air-conditioned in most cases, said the speaker DPP Aneta Rehková.
They are air-conditioned other than the cabins of some tramways, even in the passenger space.
The high temperature tramway railways haven't really damaged yet.
There was a minor damage in the Hostivar trap.
In current high temperatures, we are particularly concerned that drivers have enough drinks to be available.
"The cold drinking water is available in all the slippers, sequence points and cabins," said Range.
In carriages and in some medium places, employees have so-called contemporary producers of cold sodium.
Drivers also receive fixed protective ion beverages.
"They can also use a summer uniform that increases the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts," the speaker added.
Hot and dry weather in the last days has increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, the firefighters liquidated 108 in the Czech Republic, which is a double-time average of the day.
On Tuesday over the day when the temperatures in Czech Republic slipped over 35 degrees of Celsia, he hired firefighters mainly.
"They reconsiderate fires in the natural environment and those associated with harvest work," Nicole Zaoral said.
The firefighters did not make any relief even the evening weather change when the storms and inflammatory crashes were hot in a number of places.
In connection with the storms, firefighters were heading to 236 hits.
In particular, it was the removal of trapped trees and branches.
"The most interfered in the Mediterranean County," continues Zaoral.
However, firefighters needed help in Stvolinki in Czecholips, where 60 people from the children's camp were evacuated to safety because of the storm.
Tropical temperatures also gave work to the Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and Wednesday night, the ambulances were driven to ten cases of poisoning carbon dioxide.
That's why people should let their heaters check, warn the saviors.
Carbon dioxide is a colourless gas without a smell that relaxs in imperfect burning.
The symptoms of poison include disturbance, vomiting, headache and fainting.
In the case of suspicion of poisoning, the contaminated room should be abandoned.
Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to limit President's media diet
Many have tried it before him, and they have always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
If so, he'll be the first one.
The Portal of Politico stated that the new Chief of the White House plans to limit the flow of information from President Trump - including TV news reports - hoping to keep Trump on the level.
Here's part of the reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the new Chief of the White House John F. Kelly met the first day in his new office with the employees, he shadowed the key problem of Trumpov White House, which is going to fix: the wrong information that gets in the hands of the president.
Kelly informed employees that he must personally approve all information - whether on paper or speech - because the president can decide better on the basis of the correct information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors have broken their teeth in the media.
Trump's relationship with the media dates a few decades ago - and now that he sits in the White House, his custom to watch television news is even stronger.
"If Trump as a candidate was disturbed by honest reports, it was appropriate to show him that, in a positive light, a lot of other media talks about him, which was easier to convince," said in February for Sam Nunberg, former campaign advisor.
Tara Palmeri, from the Portal of Politico then, wrote that “a key to maintaining Trump Twitters on the knot - at least according to the words of six former organizers of his campaign - is to ensure that Trump regularly watched the media that praises him. ”
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's tendency to publicize his views on Twitter was once under control, is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something that others don't know - that Trump's tweets would be more embarrassing if they weren't checked.
Tweets that Trump never sent, we'll never know with a great probability.
If his employees managed to keep him at least a few times on the knot, then their efforts did not go away.
Nevertheless, no one has ever been able to regularly prevent Trump to incite controversial themes.
The part of this problem is that in the White House, which consists of competitive fractions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by moving the materials - which can but cannot be reliable - which supports their view of the world.
The Portal of Politico, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report on the inclination of advisors to submit doubtful information to the head of the State in May.
This is an example of such information from Shane Goldmacher's reporter:
"The current and former officials of Trump argue that the president has often responded very angryly to the negative media reports, especially the information escape reports, and strives to find their origin.
This situation occurred at the end of February, when someone emphasized the president's copy of the article from GotNews.com - the web site of Charles C. Johnson - who accused the Deputy Chief Officer Katie Walsh of being “the source of many escapes of information” from the White House.
Regardless of the fact that Johnson was forever expelled from Twitter for distress; or that he did not submit his claim with any evidence; or that he had already published false charges in the past and later revoked them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the Chief of Reince Priebus and the Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, "they were trying to implement the system for the management and documentation of information that President Trump will receive."
Would it work?
Kelly is now, three months later trying to make the same strategy.
Maybe it turns out to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness just won't be lost, and his assistants are still competiting for power.
These unchanged factors of Kelly's mission are definitely burdening.
Tourists negotiate on the arrival and return to ‘Millionary quarter’
Several of the most imposed owners of homes in the West Midland County are re-employed with determined tourists negotiating with local authorities on the rights to retrieve the field behind their homes.
Tourists parked 20 caravans on the field at the prosperous street in Solihull, which is called “millionary quarter”.
By bringing horses, children and the army of the caravans, tourists return after they were demonstrated in May. They were not afraid of a bump that was excavated on the basis of the regulations of the authorities to prevent their invasion.
A tactical group found spaces in the defense and ran into the fields with caravans with an unprotected space that served as a trip.
The angered inhabitants attacked the Solihull Administrative Council with the “not able to solve the problem”.
One of the inhabitants who wanted to remain anonymous said: “They took the place on Monday night after they were moved on the street of Bentley Heath, where they were throwing stones after other people.
The Administrative Board should be ashamed of resolving its inability.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they're back.
The other people arrived last night, and it's about to be more today."
She added : ‘Birmingham Administrative Board knows how to initiate this problem. To protect the parks, she uses judicial orders.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I don't mean to keep taxes until the Board of Administration is done with tourists."
Another anonymous inhabitants said, “It's ridiculous. We've just been watching the last traveling tourists and now they're back.
And this time there are more of them, and this time they brought their horses with them."
The press spokesman of the Solihull Administrative Council said: “We are aware of the unauthorized residence near the streetsbrook Road and in cooperation with the local police we take the necessary legal steps to resolve the whole problem.
To accumulate as much evidence, it is necessary that any non-social or illegal behaviour of the police at number 101 as possible.
We'll get a total picture that we'll present in court."
The husband of the euro ambassador hit the car in Brussels.
He was brought by by a government special.
The government special transported the wounded Robert Žitnjanski to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting on the airport and he was under constant control of Slovenian doctors.
It's been a long planned flight without complications.
Robert Žitnjanski, according to TV information, had a serious accident in Brussels in early summers.
He said he was hit by a car, and he's been in a serious state since.
After the transportation to the country, he was transported to a specialized workplace of one of the Brotherly Hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of the Slovak European Ambassador Jana Žitnjanska of NOVA.
She didn't want to say anything about the incident.
She's got three kids together.
Italians claim to fight NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy announced that it would prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships that are coming to the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean, unless the NGO signs new rules governing their operations.
"If the NGO does not sign new rules of behaviour, it will be difficult for us to continue its operations," the Minister of Interior, Marco Minnit, said in the interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
The minimum warning came the day after the Italian authorities captured a ship of the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet for suspicion of trafficking with people, which makes it significantly easier for illegal immigration.
The rescue organization, which works in the first year, refused to comment on the whole matter because of the charges by the Italian State Prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosiose.
“There is and it will always be the priority of saving human lives, and we are very sorry that we can't operate in rescue zones at the moment”, said the organization in a statement on social networks.
"All current charges can be commented only after collecting all the information and assessing the whole situation."
Italian authorities have been watching the Iuventa organization Jugend Rettet since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on the ship handed them directly to human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting took place according to the record of the prosecutor only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya. The progress of the meeting was published by the Italian media.
The ship's crew is suspected of violating the law and circumventing the Italian coastal guard, which surveys rescue operations in this area -- from humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Behaviour establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board of ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organisations that participate in rescue operations have agreed to follow the Code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activ Open Arms.
The latest designated organisation said on Thursday that new rules are not necessary but acceptable, since they are not representing any "essential change or obstacle" of rescue operations.
For example, the adoption of a new code of conduct has also been rejected by the Medicines Without Border (MSF), which holds the Nobel Price.
Meanwhile, Minnitti has been heard that the rapid decline of immigrants in the last weeks landing in Italy under rescue operations suggests that the efforts to strengthen patrols at the coast of Libya and collaboration with local mayors are fruitful.
"In the last days we are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the Minister said.
He also discovered plans for further negotiations that will take place this month with Mayors of Libya on the economic development initiative, as well as representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of achieving Europe.
The unshy Mesarosh: She had a sillicon and a cellulitis!
Hot summer days are all tricking to take on the most important thing that covers the most intimate parties.
It's just Dominica Mesarosh doing it on the contrary.
On the afternoon meeting in the Prague zoo, where the actors, moderators, singers and all those who have anything to do with TV Prima, just ham, she put her body in a mini overall.
And just a few regular movements, and the model showed everyone its sylicones, but also the ass.
In addition, she was cut out so high that she had to keep adjusting it.
The attention of the gentlemen and the present photographers was definitely unnecessary.
Michelle Carter is convicted for sending text messages encouraged to suicide Conrad Roye
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to take away two years for inciting her friend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-five years old Michelle Carter stays 15 months from a two-year penalty behind nets and then spend five years on the conditional release.
Carter was convicted in June for an uninterested murder of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Roy’s father said on Thursday in court: “The whole family is crushed.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left free until the decision was made.
She was threatened to have 20 years of deprivation, but her lawyers argumented that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
She was dressed in red pants and cream bloise, Carter stood at the proclamation of the judgment in the place with tears in her eyes, scratched hands and eyes toward the ground.
"Her doing killed Conrad Roy," the plaintiff said to the judge.
“It ends his life so she can relieve herself.
She was unable to accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She has not shown any regrets."
However, the lawyer Carter said that these were “happy circumstances he regretted in great regret. ”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “he is an age or level of maturity or even mental disorder has no significant impact on its conduct. ”
The applicant read Roy’s statement to Lynn Roy's mother: “It will not run on one day to not mourn about the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters, and together we will endure the great pain that we will bear with us forever," the statement stated.
Roy’s sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was “prosecuted ” to know that she would never attend her brother’s wedding and never will be aunt of his children.
"The loss of a man I've been seeing since my birth is the pain that I will take for life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that would affect a person who helps to kill another person.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in 2014 on the car seat, poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case attracted attention to the entire nation after Carter's text reports were published, which incited suicide.
"Even if you jump out of the building or hit yourself, I don't care," the text messages Carter sent just two weeks before he died, when Roy was on a family vacation.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote to him, "You have to do it, Conrade" and "Just throw the generator down and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to keep any comments in the press.
The case has raised many questions.
Amanda Knox was convicted for the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, the charge was released.
Ms. Knox (30) published the statements in Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison. ”
Audi will adjust up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to acute response
Just a day before the notification of Audi car manufacturer BMW stated that he would offer its customers an update of software in more than 350 000 vehicles.
The President BMW said that the company believes that “there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions” in response to European cities - including Mnichov, which is a BMW seat - which considers the ban or restriction of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he would adjust three million Mercedes cars throughout Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
No company has referred to this decision as a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have promoted largely the use of diesel atuomies in Europe and the United States to comply with the CO2 Emissions Regulations.
However, the oxide of nitrogen that releases diesel engines is considered to be carcinogen and can cause astma.
At the same time, the costs of cars for installation of gas neutralization devices issued with diesel engines are increased, which reduces the competitiveness of cars.
While German car manufacturers are facing careful examinations, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces charges of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's errors, which, in an effort to fulfil the emission limits, installed the software in their cars, which reduced the amount of emissions issued during the testing, but under normal conditions, the software has been deactivated.
Several higher representatives of Volkswagen were accused in the United States and others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, an ex-German of thermodynamics of the Audi engine development department would be arrested in Germany.
Former director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is the Italian nationality and therefore does not apply to extradition, so he can face the trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi participated in a criminal investigation of the German police in the Volkswagen car after the authorities accused Audis of the installation of the system to circle the European emission limits - and extended the charges Audi faced in the United States.
Inclusion of the Audi car in the investigation may have a mild impact on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer constitutes an unrelated share of Volkswagen profit.
The aircraft landed on the beach.
A man and a little girl died.
There was an accident on the beach of Praia de Sao João in Costa da Caparica, about 30 miles south of Lisbon.
One witness to the SIC Noticias television channel said that the plane was flying directly over the people on the beach.
Some people from the beach allegedly fled from the danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape from the machine.
A 50 - year - old man and an eight - year - old girl died on the beach according to local media.
"The aircraft crashed and they were dead at the spot," local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias described.
Their nationality is not known yet.
There were two people on the plane, both out of the accident, and the cops took them to the interrogation.
D11 or how to stop the road.
And are the roads in the Czech Republic at all final?
I'll give you a puzzle.
It's inadmissible, even though it started to happen in 1978.
Even though it's not delivered, it's always fixed.
And it can't continue to happen, even if it has a construction permit.
What's that?
Yes, D11 Castle Road.
The construction of the next section of her for a few months has newly stopped the movement of the Children of the Earth.
We're getting a railway on the east, like shaving salad.
They'll hide the wheel, and then they'll only see when and if we ever get another.
But we don't want anything miracle.
We just want a shorter ride time and we want to get trucks traveling to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Infinite flows of trucks are traveling directly through the city of Jarimir or the Invention, which is not how to circle.
But so far, the last part of our dreamed road has been carried out in 2008, that is, before the unbelievable nine years.
Since then, no knock.
So when the remaining four miles of the unfinished section to the castle of the King and the other sections to Jarimar recently began with an archaeological examination that would begin at the end of this year, you could hear a loud blow of snoops in the Eastern Czech Republic.
No one believed it again.
Last week, it turns out it wasn't going to happen this year.
And maybe not next year.
The movement of the Children of the Earth-Club for sustainable transport from Brn has given the deployment.
The children of the Earth repeat their D1 tactics.
They have been attacked by the construction authorisation entirely.
The discharge requires review of all already issued mandatory opinions of all relevant authorities.
For example, the castle magistrate, the Ministry of Environment, but also the Ministry of Defense or the Defense Authority.
So for now, we are traveling from the D11 near the village with the pronouncement name the Graveyard.
So we're going down, we're just going down the road, and suddenly we're standing on the side road, and we're preferring to then get into the colony.
The worst thing is that you see similar stories all over the Republic.
A horrible, constantly busy trip to Benesov, D1 or D8.
Everyone has a funeral.
What do the Children of the Earth require?
What is the essence of the problems of the construction of communications in Czech Republic?
And why is the road network practically incomplete in the current system?
Read in the new reflex.
Levandule from Provence threatens climate change
Levandules have become a symbol of Provence in the area of southeastern France, but now they are threatened by climate change.
Levandul is dry and harmful insect, which causes scary in the faces of researchers and farmers who seek solutions.
Eric Chaisse, agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, stated: “The plant’s production of levandules in Provence has been threatened because in the past few years the plant has been exposed to climate change that brings less crashes in the spring and autumn.
This affects the life of leanduli.
They are also guilty of cyclades and folks carrying micro-bacteria that are good in the dry climate."
There's a lot in the bet.
Levandule attracts tourists and oil that are made of them is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, unexpected and often weak plants grow.
The quantity of oil acquired from these leandules is apparently smaller."
The possible solution can be more effective distribution of water and slowing the dry water out of the soil, as well as the scratch of leanduli protective mixtures of food and water and the nobility of more species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of the journalist stresses the growing threats in Mexico
The workers of the Riodoce week regularly meet each Wednesday to discuss the news about the disturbances that take place in the area of Sinaloa for the participation of organized criminals, corrupt officials and uncomfortable drug wars.
Today, however, the efforts of recent events are mostly due to their own security.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two earned journalists are talking about what would be safer: taking their children with you to the office that someone attacked in 2009 with a grenade or leave them home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the black table: opponents, neutral and allies.
They ask journalists to give names to each word - there is no need for evidence, just use imagination and prediction.
Selecting them from what - drug dealers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose task is to cover crimes.
Violence is not rising and the bodies are all over the country; the journalists are constantly arriving: according to the Committee for the Protection of Reporters, at least 25 of the entry of President Enrique Pen Net to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and in all seven of the States, seven have been killed this year.
Meanwhile, Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books about violence associated with drug trafficking.
His loss is sensitive, even though his presence is all-progressive - a large photograph of Valdeze with the title “Superty”, on which the mediator shows, hangs in the circuit of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - aged over 30 years of age, have a shirt with a picture of Valdeze with a smile on their face, with glasses on the nose and cap of Panama.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; the journalists talk about mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecution was established in 2010 in order to address the cases of journalists, it has still been sued by two suspects, according to the statement of the Committee on the Protection of Reporters.
Most of the thousands of murders that happen every year are connected to drug trafficking and organized crime.
The Riodoca journalists insist that they will inform the violence that is happening in Sinaloe; even though they are destruction by sadness and the territory is now very betrayal.
Without information about the slaughter and the vision of justice, the security meeting is unreasonable, says Ibarra.
“It's a fun to waste time for such meetings,” he adds.
"If we don't get more information, we can't trust anyone."
In the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce headquarters in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to run a few blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, all due to the name of the article - which can be translated as the Twelveth River.
The shooters then entered his car and broke him near the scene of the crime.
Valdez died at 50 years of age.
He left his wife and two adult children behind him.
Sounds like the news is spreading fast in Culiacan.
But in Valdez's case, there is a suspicious silence.
Since last arrest of Guzman and his January edition to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the most bleeding warfares of the country, as the competitive fractions try to fill an empty place.
Every day, several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi, and the cemetery are filled with two - floor mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word “condition” is thought that one drug cartel controls the coastal state with precious ports and important routes traveling to the United States of Drugs.
Despite the fact that Valdez was confidently familiar with the risks of his job, Ismail Bojorquez (60), the co-founder and director Riodoce continues to condemn that he did not protect his friend.
They believe that two doubts contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of a conversation with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that led war with the sons of Joaquin Guzman.
The peace could be angry with the sons; suspect members of the gang bought all the copies of the papers at the time they landed on the boards.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after taking other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is viewed as an important militia in the fight of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He was able to survive so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In the Noroest period, he was practically veteran when he decided to sell his shares worth $50 and build together with five Riodoce colleagues in 2003.
In Sinaloe, “what was impossible to operate a journalist and not mention drug trade, ” said Bojorquez.
In time, Riodoce got a good reputation for courageous and true news; the papers began to work.
The journalists loved to search for problems and to publish texts without censorship - the reader fascinated reading stories that no one ever dared to tell.
Eight years after the establishment Riodoce won the prestigious appreciation of Maria Moors Cabot for the Latin America report.
The same year, Valdez won the appreciation of the International Freedom of the Press Committee for the Protection of Reporters for his brave report on the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted that he was scared.
"I was worried about my life," he stated when he accepted the price.
Trafficking in drugs in Sinaloae is a “life condition”, Valdez said in October last year in a Rompeviento TV interview.
"You must take the role of a journalist - or play a fool.
I don't want anyone to ask me, "What did you do with the face of death... why didn't you say what's going on?"
The employees of Riodoce missed Waldez. The man was known by his joking and non-electoral language. He was a good friend who loved giving advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relyed on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar across the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: did this routine blame his death?
His death also raised questions about its own assumptions - how do you do your job as best and remain alive?
"They don't like to interfere with their wives, children, clean shops, secret landing areas."
"Those things were forbidden," said Bojorquez.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-saving.
You must trust your instincts.
If you feel something's wrong here, your hands off.
The problem is in it, said editor Riodoce Andres Villarreal, "the smell is a sense that can be screwed up... and then the thing with Javier."
The old rules according to him, like others, are no longer valid in Sinaloae - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other countries that are the home of the toxic mix of luxury trails, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No mobile phones were allowed in the room where Riodoce’s employees were meeting; a few days ago, a spyware was discovered, which was purchased by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Two police officers find relief in front of the building in the shadows of a nearby tree.
They were elected to protect Riodoce's offices, located in a four-foot building in Culiacana.
The journalists are making fun of whether these police officers are not part of 50 percent of the lawguards who are corrupt according to the government's statements.
It's been a few months since the journalists last went to the mountain areas that are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week's program.
First of them is the murder of a former boxer brother Julio Cesar Chaveza in Sinaloe.
They are also devoted to suspected government expenditures that took place in the hometown of the governor of the State.
Recently, several kidnappings also occurred in one of the most luxurious Culiacan restaurants, just a block from the office of the State Deputy.
No one officially announced the identity of abducted persons or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so the journalists were careful when they were about to write about what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is the favorite destination of drug dealers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from the public records that the restaurant was registered under the name associated with a certain policy member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which controls all levels of the political scene nearly the past century.
Several governors of the PRI have recently been accused of corruption on high posts.
Villarreal asked the journalist to write about the previous incidents that happened in the restaurant, including the incident in which one of the sons of Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman fled the military force.
A month ago, readers would read about this subject in Valdez’s series, which was the best source of information about kidnapping.
"Valdez would definitely settle the case," Villarreal (46) said, named "El Flaco" for his thin figure.
"Now all the informers have turned their back to us."
Valdez's office turned into a store of tags and labels for protests against the killing of journalists. The employees certainly didn't expect them to be activists in representing the press.
The journalist Miriam Ramirez caught several tags and was given up next morning to show the office of the State Deputy for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacan.
Only a burned body was discovered, and the authorities claim that based on DNA analysis, it was Adamea.
The activity of journalists is expansive throughout the country, many of which are organizing protests and scattering on the railroads and buildings "SOS press".
The director of the Bojorquez newspaper is the day to visit Washington, where he is trying to gain international support and reach justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloy, the day after Valdez was murdered, Ramirez accused the authorities of monitoring journalists and their murders for reporting the truth.
Meanwhile, she asked for a transfer to another department of fear that her anger could endanger her impartiality.
Valdez repeatedly stated that the Mexican journalists are “occupied” by organized crime, corrupt officials and an indifferent public.
In his last book “Narco-journalism”, he wrote that journalists are dying not only with the hands of drug cartels, but also on ordering politics and security forces that cooperate with organised crime.
The media team of Articulo 19 accused of more than half of all the attacks on the police and public officials.
"In Mexico you will die because they want to silence you," Ramirez added.
Murders are obviously working.
No one will forget the death of Maria Elizabeth Macias, which happened six years ago at the northern borders of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found together with a message that the Zetas cartel reportedly signed: “This is how I finished for my messages. ”
Within the head cut, the keyboard and the ears were lying.
Some branch offices have decided to end the activities, such as the El Norte newspaper, with a seat at the northern borders of Chihuahua in response to the march murder of rapporteur Miroslava Breach.
Others continue, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after their director was killed in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed public drug cartels an article on the opening page entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists fled their homes or even across the border.
It's an easy decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, just as to get rid of the feeling that someone is constantly persecuting you.
And the journalists are persecuted and murdered, for example, in the case of Ruben Espinos, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in the apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape of Veracruz.
For those who have decided to stay and do not give up their work, it is a great risk every day.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet once, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is heading to hell, so I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday midnight and Riodoce employees are sitting on a trail in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when the phone starts to call at a sudden time.
They find out that 19 people died in the shooting between gang members and cops near the beach resort in Mazatlan.
The war is increasing, just as many messages left in this area were promised by the members of the union.
The journalists are reporting this news from a mobile phone on Riodoce’s website.
It will not run any day and the introductory title will change again.
The sounds of the police sirens point to the next shooting.
Bojorquez is throwing a flying look at the police patrol to make sure they're careful.
If they're afraid, they don't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-osnider of their periodic - whose mediator is an explicit slog for all Sinaloe - all employees of Riodoce follow his steps.
"How could we think of leaving," Bojorquez said, "if the same day I was killed by Javier, a intern asked me to send her to the streets?"
Dinosaurs used the camouflage to avoid enemies
At first, it looks like a statue, whatever scary.
Researchers have now discovered the conclusions of the first discovery of an amazing creature of the size of a nosorog, whose perfectly preserved remains -- which the experts called “Mona Lisa dinosaurs” -- found a Canadian miner.
The remains were maintained so high that the experts could determine the red brown color of his thick skin and indicated that the dinosaurus had “the problem past”.
The article in the current Biology states that it is “the most preservative of the ever found defensive dinosaur and one of the best types of dinosaur in the world”.
The fossil is a new species of Nodosauridae. Dinosaurus lived in the period of Crida, approximately 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked by researchers who described him as “remarkable. ”
The converted biologist is according to the National Geographic, the best preserved stone of its species.
Behind the finding of Shawn Funk, who discovered the stoneline on March 21, 2011 at the wandering of Suncore Millenium near the Canadian Alberta.
He ran into something that looked like a strange object and decided to examine it closer.
The stoneline was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working on the discovery of the animal from a huge piece of 1,100 kg country.
After the work is complete, the dinosaurus is ready to discover.
“Let's just tickle your eyes a little and you'll believe he's asleep,” said the chief of the work of Caleb Brown and the Natural Museum of Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exposed.
“It will certainly be recorded in history as one of the most beautiful and most inspired species of dinosaur - Mona Lisa dinosaurs.”
By study of his skin, researchers discovered that this bilogist -- even though he was covered with armor and reminded of the walking tank -- with a great probability to face a serious threat from massive dinosaurs.
Hardly armed dinosaurus used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used the masking system that used many animals today.
Experts claim that it made him better connect with his surroundings and avoid enemy. The masking system suggests that he was the favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
Reports about 110 million years old dinosaur folks of Nodosauridae appeared for the first time in May newspapers. Currently, it is available to watch in Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named him Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technique Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7000 hours with the team with a careful discovery of fossil.
Thanks to the incredibly preserved state of fossil, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists could document patterns and shapes and armors throughout the body.
They discovered the method of masking used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, findings of researchers are surprising because the size of Borealopelta is far above today’s animals using the same technology.
So it is possible that the dinosaur was so many predators that evolution has given the advantage of masking before confrontation.
Many of the present animals with masking - the bowl of deer, zebra and or a belt - are much smaller and vulnerable as a capable, which suggests that the nosdaurus had to fight for his survived literally.
“The presentation of a huge and hard-defined dinosaur illustrates the dangers represented by predators during the cryde period,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic ingredients contained in the loops also revealed that the dinosaur skin had probably red brown color.
Researchers continue to study animals and look for further knowledge of his life, including stomach stomach content, to search for his last food.
They believe that the dinosaurus fell into the river after death and was taken to the sea where he drowned on the bottom.
At the same time, the climate in Alberta was the same as today in Florida and the rivers and the oceans were moving far away into the inlands than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in the fact that it is completely covered in the perfectly preserved skin and is maintained in three dimensions, so we can see its original size," Brown said.
“For these reasons, the animal looks practically as at the time of the crystal.
You don't need to use your imagination to reconstruct it; you're just a little bit of a blink of your eyes and it seems like he's just sleeping.'
During the period of creed, giant terropods, massive dinosaurs that were moving on two legs were walking around the earth.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived a few million years after Borealopelta, this armed dinosaurus could be the favorite advantage of his equally fearful ancestors.
Among them belongs Acrocanthosaurus, 11,5 metres long monster with weight over 6 tonnes.
Researchers whose latest findings were published in the Current Biology magazine believe that Boreapelta’s body was flooded into the sea after he was mumified in the mud.
Behind the finding of Shawn Funk, who discovered the stoneline on March 21, 2011 at the wandering of Suncore Millenium near the Canadian Alberta.
According to the museum, it is the best maintained fiber dinosaur in the world, including the skin and armor, which is also complete from the squirrel to the bowl.
The animal reached a diameter of 5 meters and weighted up to 1300 kg.
His shoulders were two inches of fifty inches out of his shoulder.
The researchers believe that this biologist was scattering the territory of Canada today until he ended up in a river that floated him into the sea.
His submarine grave kept the body in perfect condition.
The fossil remnants of this species are also maintained to the extent that the fences around the skull continue to cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, “the finding of this preserved individual can be compared to the victory in the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the shocking finding seems to me.
The fossil remnants of this species are also maintained to the extent that the fences around the skull continue to cover the remains of the skin.
His right front leg is lying on his side with his fingers upwards.
It's easy to count the mess on his stairs."
How did one activist know the answer to the question: ‘Whose Streets?’
9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell shakes all over her body.
The day after she arrived in New York, the family from St. Louis sat on a bed in the Airbnb room and went through papers on Facebook on her phone.
She ran into the contribution of a high school student.
"The police just shot an 18-year-old young man whose body is still lying on the street," he said.
She wondered no one else wrote this article to her, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The user @TheePharoah constantly retweeted her contributions to the wall.
Rapper from St. Louis published on Twitter his contributions to the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old young man who was shot by a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a picture of Brown's body, which lies without control on the street, where no one took it after four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put the phone down to return to him the night she was watching tweets about people who were gathering at Canfield Drive.
She was watching pictures of police tapes and screaming people, and one of the men claimed that he was the father of the victim and had a sign in his hand with the "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son"!
She was watching live news - one of the cops was standing in front of a group of protesters, holding a lead in her hand and on his second end of the dog screwing.
In another video, another cop said, the gun he was targeting against the crowd, yelling, "I'll kill all of you... animals."
"It's not normal," Ferrell said.
"This is not the type of murder we used to and which we can call normal.
I felt a huge skin all over my body.
"I was angry and I was crying."
She immediately ordered her flight back and traveled home the other day.
After landing at 11:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years describes a new document “Whose Streets ”?
It's a story of survival and protests, love and resistance, strength and integrity that is told from the view of people living in the community who go to the streets and require answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell introduced a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a flower dress and the same flower chief - about the theme they've discussed before many times - "on experience with blacks".
"Do you remember how I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed?" he recalls a conversation.
"We're just going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old young man and that's not right."
"I didn't think I would take her with me," Ferrell later said.
"Today's events are the superiority... that happened in the past.
She must have known and seen it in her own eyes and grew up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organizing, but also to know the difference between different layers of experience with blacks and what we have to do to free ourselves.
Although I am able to provide her with the conditions in which she does not live on her own racism, there is no difference in any other black child-wife.
I feel like if I protected her from this experience, I would only harm her."
After arriving in Ferguson, it was the first stop in South Florissant Road against the police department, which became the base of activists expecting the words of the police officer Darren Wilson on his possible participation in the incident.
Here Ferrell and her daughter met a local entrepreneur who was preparing for other foods.
They prepared food together for bags and helped to distribute it to the Protestants.
In the eyes of Ferrell, a new type of activism began to be born slowly.
"My activism turned up on 9 August," Ferrell said and added that at the high school of the University of Missouri-St. Louis was the president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and was trying to introduce healthcare and food in the black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met the later director of the document Sabaah Folayan during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted "only to document" events in progress.
But Ferrell thought: “You are working on the document or you are trying to find a story that could be used? ”
Such skepticism has been invading into the community through many people, often white people who wanted to earn for pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in a recent conversation: “We have heard that the voices of people who are born and grown up in Ferguson are very often disregarded and that we wanted to change. ”
Folayan has already been cooperating with Damon Davis, a recognised local artist dealing with the subject of prisoners in the death cell.
It also invested Ferrell and the other six local inhabitants followed by the "Whose Streets" team in the following years after Brown was murdered.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but this is our statement," Davis said.
"It was important to me - how these people will be represented - because I will be represented in the same way."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - trying to show that the movement is not about the rescue leader but the communities' combination, Folayan said - it was the most open to the film participation.
The document “Whose Streets?” describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, as she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face when she thought about the first time she saw the final version of the document.
"But I realized that to do this job and polish black people, I must open myself."
The Ferrell story also emphasizes the role of a central black woman in a broader aspect of Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of movement - who created in response to killing a teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on social media campaigns under #BlackLivesMatter - call themselves freaks.
"Black central women at the leadership positions in the final end stands behind the remaining movement," Ferrell said, "because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black central women must bear the weight of these events."
Folayan agrees with this expression and adds that “the movement is actually supported by black women and a lot of extremary black women. ”
However, it insists that “this is not just an affirmative matter” and Ferrell is not the main hero of the document because of her opinions.
"That's what she was the power and the source of energy," she said.
“that she was in the front lines is not a coincidence, because life on these crossings in the skin of a black weird woman is dangerous.
You can feel that energy inflammation even in front of the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the television stations cleared their positions, but the heavy racial bonds between the community and the police are staying.
Ferrell's getting two and a half years off for blocking the road at the demonstration.
The socially political atmosphere in the area that she calls home, she described as “Inhales.”
Still, she does not stand in its efforts to which she was committed from the time she went to Ferguson's streets three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains."
There was a field burning in the Colinland.
There were dozens of firefighters, helped the helicopter.
Nearby the Czech ship in Kolinsk, between the villages of Bilana and Liblica, burned from 2:00 a.m. a field of approximately 15 hectares.
Fire stopped spreading around 15:15, firemen announced a third degree of fire alarm from four possible.
According to the speaker, Ladislav Holomczyk helped fire from the air to fire fire and a helicopter.
At 6:00, firefighters managed to extinguish, fire caused damage for 70,000 crowns.
There were dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters fighting the flames on the spot.
The fire was caused by a technical disturbance in the combaine motor space.
Hasit also helped a helicopter, which totally carried out six pitches of water.
"Instead of an intervention, we handed over to the owner until tomorrow 8:00 he will be guarded by a voluntary fireman," said the Guy today.
And Becoming Resemblance: the artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms of the New York Fridman Gallery, there are a few faces of different shades of skin - white, black and eating - hanged from the ceiling on the wire. Each of them is like to fall out of the eye of the previous.
All 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the lipstick and hair sent to her Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where a former analyst dismissed 35 years of penalty for an unauthorized release of secret cabelograms to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition that was launched on August 2 is named A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines its experience with technology, information and art, and Manning - transsexual and pioneer dissident, whose sentence was reduced by Obama three days before leaving President of the U.S. post.
Algorithmic DNA analysis of Manning and using 30 portraits to illustrate how a person with this genotype has created Dewey-Hagborg sharp, if not an intellectual comment on DNA subduct - as well as many ways of interpreting DNA - and the unreasonable determination of these interpretations, as well as the identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has spoken about being a woman since she was young. She was convicted in 2013 on the basis of twenty charges, including violations of six spy laws, computer fraud and stealing.
All its photographs were held by prison employees. Only one black-white photograph fled to the public in a lower quality, to which Manning, apparently concerned, is sitting on the seat of the driver in Platin's blond passport, which is now connected to.
In 2015, the Dewey-Hagborg project of 2012 Stranger Visions continued to respond positively.
In the context of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarettes and gums - to create a picture of possible forms of these people.
And at that time, she received an e-mail from the Paper Magazine.
"They wanted an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to complement the article with a portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained at the opportunity to open a new exhibition.
However, visits or photographs were not permitted, so they asked Chelsea if she had an interest in the DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned museum were screwed over two years through a correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who presented the vision of what would happen if Chelsea was loved and could attend the exhibition personally.
President Obama really asked for a release of Manning after a few years of insufficient time spent in a military prison in Kansas.
It is really interesting that the exhibition takes place just when Donald Trump runs a war with people who seek to publicize government information and transgender soldiers, while trying to find new ways to stimulate their tweets in areas that he should support.
In response to the question regarding this special timeout, Dewey-Hagborg stated that “all is happening for some reason. ”
Under an artist's statement on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls for her huge signature (written “i” in the name is exposed with the heart) after the end of “self-related fractionarity based on sex, race, sexuality and culture”.
On the opposite side, there are sequences of its mitochondrial DNA - a stonoge of letters C, G and A recorded by a pencil.
By typing 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist) Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate as surprisingly similar, at least on the biological page, we all are.
"I hope that people will take it out that our genom doesn't matter who we are, and that the genetic data are subjective and everyone can interpret them on their own," Dewey-Hagborg said. It is also visible for her work in the 2007 Spurous Memories on the video.
"DAY tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last example of the exhibition located in the separate room is the only page of the above graphical novel.
It shows Manning, which comes into the way of King Kong from the United States Disiplinary Barracks prison with a megaphone in his hand.
"When they prevent you from speaking, they win," it says.
"Never let yourselves shut up."
"It is a direct rescription from one of the letters," said the Philadelphian artist.
"When I think about it, my skin is jumping on."
Manning has not visited the exhibition personally -- which was predicted in the comic book -- but when it happens, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room with its masks, its own genome images, sorted as a crowd of protestants.
Which was also the goal of the exhibition, including nearly 160 cm of the high statue of Maninga, where its genetic haploskups were recorded.
"In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time, I wanted the mob to make them feel like a mob," Dewey-Hagborg said about portraits.
"I wanted to suggest the impression of the mass movement that takes the form of Chelsea and releases it."
Professor Northwest University and employee of the Oxford University are searched for murder
In these days, a full-national search for a professor of the Northwest University and employees of the Oxford University, who are being pursued for suspicion of the murder of a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, stated the police.
On Monday, an arrester was issued for the murder of the first degree on a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged collaboration at Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, states the Cook County's court record.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died of several stabbing wounds.
The Chicago police declared that the body of the dead was found on July 27th.
The police were telephonely alerted to this fact, and after arriving in the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found a victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead and detectives investigate the case as a murder.
Lathem has worked on the position of the docent of microbiology and immunology of the Northwest University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of the University for Public Contact, in his e-mail statement, stated that Lathem is now at administrative vacation and has been prohibited from entering school spaces in the university.
"The whole matter is now investigated by the competent authorities and the Northwest University is fully cooperating with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial manager at the Oxford University.
The University Speaker and Somerville College stated in an e-mail statement: “We were contacted by the British police and we are also ready to assist the US police.”
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wished to join the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of contact with the public of the Chicago police department, said that he calls on suspects to give up to the competent authorities.
"The police have information about their place of stay and the search of suspects is increasing," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities assisted in searching for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the Grand Plaza Building Manager, which was notified of the event to be held in apartment No. 1008.
The police described the whole scene as a very violent one.
Guglielmi said it was not clear whether the incident occurred on July 27th.
He added that Lathom and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe that Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
The Guide of Grand Plaza issued a statement for all residents: “The police are now working on creating a time review and profile of the victim and investigating various motives, including domestic violence.”
"In a rapid future, we will complete the WADA plan" - Deputy President of the Russian government, Mutko
The Deputy President of the Russian Government, Vitaly Mutko, stated that it will not take long and that the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“A part of the new plan criteria have already been completed and RUSADA has already obtained the right to plan and test in collaboration with the British Antidoping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this fact, the WADA plan was updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan to meet the code - which describes the criteria for renewal of the validity of RUSADA - which has recently been published on the organization's website.
According to Mutka Codex, there's nothing that Russia should worry about.
“All was notified and all will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA as soon as possible," he added.
One of the criteria mentioned, however, calls for the public notification of the WADA investigations investigated by Richard McLaren on the alleged sponsorship of the doping of Russian sportsmen by the government.
On this subject, Mutko said: “We conduct an investigation because our antidoping system clearly failed.
It was approached to all measures.
However, there were no state programmes in our country and we cannot therefore confess to something that never existed."
Mutkov's words confirmed Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In the Russian RSport Smirnov interview, he admitted the problems of Russian antidoping factors, but added: “In many occasions, we have stated that the report contains controversial attitudes and regulations.
No one plans to accept the message completely without an exception," Smirnov finished.
WADA suspected RUSADA of the delivery of doping controls within Russia in November 2015 directly before the doping scandal.
However, the organization allowed planning and uniting testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this year in June.
Following the visit to the Moscow Centre of the organization in July, Director-General WADA Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is “in the right way ” to renew the validity.
The police accused three people, one is a youth.
The police accused three men of the establishment of a medium fire of a rare wooden church in Trinci-Gutech at Frideck-Mestek.
One accused is a youth, all three are Czech nations.
For the crime of the general threat, they are in danger of up to 15 years of imprisonment.
The journalists today told the Seaman police director Tomasz Kugel.
He said it was a deliberate crime.
"It is a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter," Kugel said.
He stated that the police would deal with possible detention of the accused.
Additional information is not possible to be published by the Director.
"I can't tell you more, because the criminal police and investigation work on matters, and the State representative who supervises the matter," Kugel said.
The wooden church of God’s body in Gutech came from the 16th century.
He was a valuable memory with many original equipment and pictures of the first half of the 16th century.
Wealth damage will go according to preliminary estimates to dozens of millions of crowns, but historical loss is innumerable.
After the fire, the reconstruction of the church began to be considered.
Most of the costs should be covered by the insurance, the additional costs are ready to share the Ministry of Culture and the city, the public collection is also prepared and the contribution of the owner of the memorial, that is, local faintness.
Similar wooden church of St. Katherine of the 16th century in Ostrava-Grabova also destroyed fire 15 years ago.
It's been caused by an electro-installation in that time.
In his place, there were exact copys.
The state counts with citizens in the defense of the state.
He'll support their training.
With financial support for the communities used in the defence of the State, with voluntary arrow training or with the training team, it counts the actual purpose of the law on the readiness of citizens to defend the State.
The Ministry of Defence, which has been appointed by the government, promises that he will be able to increase the physical ability of the Czech and their ability that could then be used in crisis situations.
It comes from the proposal that the Ministry has prepared.
If the law had been adopted in the future, the State would provide for a regular defence of hundreds of millions of crowns.
The main objective of the proposal is, according to its authors, to create an effective system that would help to increase the readiness of the Czech Republic to defend the State, outside the performance of the defence obligation and on the basis of volunteering.
For example, the State would financially or materially support the communities of amateurs, shooters or kinologists and allow them to increase their ability.
In return, he would receive information on people who are willing to come to the country in the time of the crisis to help, and their capacities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to help the communities and other stakeholders in training or training.
It is also compared to the organization of words with war veterans or people who act heroically.
One of the possible options suggests that a new agency would be established to be responsible for the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal emphasize that the participation of people should be voluntary and the State would use their capabilities until they announce the state of threats.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual deletion of earlier obvious borders between individual types of threats," states in the intention of reference to the threats of so-called hybrid threats.
The ministers noted that there is therefore a need to focus on the support of as wide as possible, not only the military.
"The basic goal of the intention is to create a very broad base that will enable each citizen to respond qualifiedly to the situation threatening the supremeness of the State or of life, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, in case to contribute to the protection of others, and to the wrong behavior to avoid the fulfilment of the tasks of the Czech Republic's armed forces," he states the intention.
The adoption of the law would bring a lot of financial privileges.
Their elevation will depend on the choice of the Ministry.
For example, the Authority assumes financial support for projects to prepare citizens to defend the State up to 100 million crowns.
If the administrative and coordinating centre is established, its operation could cost about 60 million crowns a year.
Other money would go to payments or to build the information system.
The proposal also assumes that the scope of the district military commands should be expanded, which would combin more than 42 soldiers.
The representatives of the Ministry have already stated that the law should also help solve the disagreement of certain Czech politicians with the introduction of the European Union's Directive on the holding of weapons.
His adoption would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to keep some weapons that directives.
Startups that help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the level of satisfaction of her e-commerce startup employees, but she did not find a suitable survey.
The answers were often incorrect, useless, or even fake.
And even though she promised anonymity of research, some employees expressed their untrustedness in the whole process.
"I've been looking for consistency and objectiveness," said Erett, owner of the company's e-commerce of haircare Madison Reed, with a resident in San Francisco, who employs 75 people.
So she asked for outside aid.
In the market, new startups from human resources are constantly being presented, which are helping the company to examine the satisfaction of employees.
By creating and licencing software with a specific purpose of measuring employees' responsibilities, startups allow companies to carry out rapid votes, target specific teams and demographic groups, further offers the full anonymity of employees and the hot line for complaints, and in some cases they also allow informers to check over the supervisors and contact direct direct directors.
"There are tools such as Strava and Fitbit that are watching your health condition, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-based and the Director-General of Startup Glint with a resident in Reedwood City.
Errett said that thanks to Glint, she got more aware of what her employees think and feel in three years.
In addition to rapid surveys and voting of specific teams, Glint offers a company's temperature map and an executive review of groups with highest number of complaints, as well as a review of low-value managers - which allows users to work on corrections.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to look after the culture of the workplace - in case another Uber becomes a scandal - which is discarded after the former employee published on his blog a contribution described by the company environment and the disturbance of employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, demand for research of the company culture is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global sector of control, regulation and completion by 2020 can exceed $118,8 billion.
Startup Convercent from Denver in Colorado, which helps companies in prevention and disclosure of inappropriate behaviour, saw a small increase in interest and activities at the beginning of the year, just before the Uber scandals.
Almost 600 Convercent clients belong to Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber also accepted his wings under his wings.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send adaptable "flash" surveys, collect confidential information in real time and display the temperature maps of difficult areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hot line that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, complaints shall be sent directly to the Administrative Board.
"The Court of Justice of Public Opinions has authorized regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and executive director of startup Convercent.
If the company is convicted of wrong treatment with its employees or non-ethical behaviour - and if the regulators do not proceed - it may face cost-effects as a result of the customer's boycott, exhaustion of employees or judicial proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Restaurant Network of Ruby Tuesday, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, uses Convercent for more than a year to increase the awareness of business principles and procedures and to ensure a easy way to contact corporate leadership.
Earlier, if the employee wanted to report any problem, he had to oversight the phone number or e-mail of the company's management, formally file a complaint and hope for an excellent solution.
It was often a scary and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, a general representative of Ruby Tuesday, who used to have no reliable way of monitoring the complaints of employees.
Now, when the company is using Convercent, fast detection and solutions of problems that have never come to the managers sitting in offices are secured on a mile away from the real solution to complaints - the discrimination, disturbance or unfair treatment.
"It is close to the holistic, general view of the experience of employees," Vitrano said, who runs the group of Ruby Tuesday to supervise risk management.
"We are vulnerable to protect shareholders from judicial disputes by employees."
Companies stopped taking ethics, values and participation of employees on light weight in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen crashed after Enron's fall in the issue of abuse of ethical rights of employees, Quinlan said.
But only when “the whole thing has enlightened the social media, ” companies began to realize that in the online world they cannot easily hide their coffins in the closet.
"Before people began using technology ethics, they relied on faith," Quinlan added.
Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by the brave capital investors who supported both startups.
Convercent chose as part of his February campaign from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital total $10 million and finally took the capital of $47 million.
Glint won $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and gained $60 million during the entire campaign.
These investments are not surprising with regard to the mutual nature of companies, culture and risk capital.
The growing number of research clearly confirms that today’s employees expect from their workplace more than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, it is not the main advantage of high salary and interesting projects.
Employees want to understand that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are devoting their time to a society that strives to a positive mission.
"If people are happy in their work, they feel that their voice is heard and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, vice-president of the global benefits and job benefits of LinkedIn, which uses Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn if companies and companies are successful, if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure the involvement and commitment of employees to society, it is no wonder that there are many investors who will support this effort.
According to experts on work culture, it is important to provide data on the satisfaction of employees.
But the data itself are incompetent if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is that once the company asks for a remark from its employees, there may be major changes.
And if the change does not occur quickly - in the worst case - can cause disappointment and no interest in employees.
"When you ask for 4000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4000 conversations," said Russell Raath, director of consultation at Kotter International, who was witnessing many companies who were too relying on data themselves.
“Because when you don't get things to the end, the employees start asking themselves: ‘Have they ever heard me?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, then why should it interest me?"
Madison Reed, which is currently regularly conducting a survey between employees every month, can solve the problem by Glint in one day, said Errett.
After the reunion of employees who were frustrated by slow decisions and quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and start training communications to address the problem.
Ruby Tuesday has a very important view of its employees and hopes that, in a long term, it will achieve high employment in the field known as a common release.
"If you do not strive to create a transparent work environment, employees will not believe you," Vitrano added.
"And once you start losing your employees, you lose customers.
And the whole company is breaking down with the customer's inflammation."
Thursday became the warmest day.
Thursday, with 38.3 degrees recorded in the Watch Tower in Hodoninia, is the warmest day of the year in Czech Republic.
So he overcome the Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year at 37.3 degrees.
The workers of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute were informed of this.
Thursday, but there were no lots of temperature records.
The vedra hit Moreva mainly, the Czech Republic was mostly clouded.
On Tuesday, the records were overcome or balanced to 35 out of 145 meteorological stations measured over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded the record.
For example, today, the temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In the Lednici in Brzeclaw today, 37.4 degrees have overcome the original maximum of four tenths of the degrees and the current 37.1 degrees in the Pogorelice in Brněnsk have exceeded the record by three dozens.
Both records, just like the Guardian, came from 2013.
The high temperatures appeared today mainly in the south and east of Morava.
After the Watch was the biggest heat in Dyjakovic in Znoyemska and Brode over Dyja in Brzeclavska, where the mercury rose at 37.8 degrees, but the record did not overcome.
On the contrary, in the West and Northwest Czech, for example, the highest temperatures in the Czech Republic were only about 22 degrees of Celsia.
"The temperatures have grown there just now afternoon," the meteorologists reported.
Contemporary vegetables in Czech Republic will gradually be distinguished according to the CHMU and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
But most of the places of Morava will remain high temperatures on Friday and southeast of Morava and on Saturday.
We've got this kind of screwed up here.
The billionaire is not enough for the same voice in the elections as every one full-year-old man in the country.
They want to decide directly, and because not all are as hard as Andrew Babish, who wants to own a state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penty Marek Dospava, along with other colleagues behind the water, Martin Burdo and Antonin Frych, is sponsoring Robeyschow Realists.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is financed by the insurance owner and the real estate entrepreneur, Paul Sehnal, who is also the chairman.
The convicted corruption and the king of the Czech gambling Ivo Valenta acquired the Party of Privates.
Political movement Agrofert, as the project of Andreja Babiša did not name the exclusive mayor Jaroslav Germany, is a chapter for itself.
The mayors have recently been captured by their billionaire.
It's Dalibor Grandpa, the owner of the company for Jablotron security equipment.
According to his own words, he enters politics to do good.
But the grandfather didn't get much in the city's dress.
"I never dreamed of small goals," he said at the press conference.
That means that my goal is to make the ANO move to get the Starship's movements in the elections of twenty percent.
Leckdo smiled.
But grandfather's interruption is more convenient.
Millior Dalibor Grandpa is a man of firm opinions.
Although he's going to speak about votes in the coat of the Stars, he continues to support Andreja Babisha.
Because the grandfather supported Babiša in previous parliamentary elections.
"Babish is not a shooted speaker and does not control the loving rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about it before the elections 2013.
But it's definitely not politics because he wants to improve himself personally.
Babish will remain a hero for me.
He is willing to step out of his world under control and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors presented him as a new force, he reaffirmed his admiration to Babish.
And he said he wanted the Mayors to learn how to cooperate with Babish.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa does not change his views and stands behind her, regardless of the coat he wears.
Others can speculate whether Babish sends to the mayors to build his beach someone like this.
Others may ask if the chief of Jablotron had not broken up in bad store with the boss of Agrofert and is looking for another way to defend his business rival.
But the first grandfather’s public performance was not just around Babisa.
Grandpa promised to send 10 million crowns to the Mayors.
And if they need more money, he'll send more.
A few years ago, it would be hard to stop over a similar saying.
Otherwise, the legally recognised gouner Zdenek Bakala had thrown millions on all parties before the elections in 2010.
The Political Security Division of Vita Barta, TOP 09 and civil democrats gathered at almost 30 million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits any political party to give over three million.
When Grandpa's getting into politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
He may not have to ask himself why politics has such a bad reputation in our house.
His first days in politics then Grandpa crowned his proposal for tax benefits from families with studied children.
People with high school education will come to us about 50 grand a month.
Those with the base for less than 20s.
A man with 50 thousand is rich for this environment.
The one with the 20 poor.
In the vision of Grandpa, the poor people pay fair taxes and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of the social state whose walk is not too much involved.
The wealthy is simply needed to help them not to endure poverty with poverty.
The mayors can congratulate each other for their new acquisition, and Babish wash hands.
The other ones, and our grandfather, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
There's still a question about who to vote.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who members and members of their party or citizens and citizens of the State do not become their employees and the country as their property.
Finally, those who want to live well in the rich land, not just to some people.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex must have cheaped 234 million.
It's not easy to sell real estate sometimes.
And a lot of times he won't have 11 bedrooms, a beautiful sea view, or the fact that the real estate is selling the US President Donald Trump.
During the sale of a villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down at an unbelievable 8 million pounds.
He informed the website Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says, "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Run to the place like no other.
But even the connection of the reality company with the American President did not defend the extreme price.
Donald Trump had to reduce his Caribbean residence's price of incredible 8 million pounds.
The original property price was 21.5 million pounds, the final price dropped to 13 million pounds.
So even after the discount, the villa complex stands about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's nothing to wonder.
The excellent site of 5 acres in the Caribbean island, Saint Martin, has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
Part of the land is also a pool and a tennis kurt.
There are tens of palms on the land.
The terrace is a beautiful sea view.
According to real estate experts, the fact that the connection with the president is not sufficient to attract potential buyers.
The real estate is now closer to the common real estate prices on the island.
Trump bought real estate in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about 15 million pounds.
Real estate was to buy for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property in St. Martin Island.
But with a new price, they are settled in the second place.
The neighbourhood property was estimated at 13.5 million pounds.
NCAA decided to end two trainings a day.
The eleventh morning and American football players of the UCLA university are close to the sideline of the new school field.
Some of them take off their dresses and reveal sweating backs, unfaithful sign of the first day of the training camp.
For most members of the team of these few minutes, nothing is supplied by the afternoon break.
The players recorded in the summer semester will go to rooms after a three-hour training to study at the final tests before returning to Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that will be held on the next morning at 6:30.
"For these boys, the next three days will be a real pussy," said Coach Bruins Jim Mora a moment before Monday was overweight on Tuesday.
With two trainings in one day, NCAA wants to ease players - paradoxically, these training days are even longer - so at least Friday, when final tests are finished.
That's why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled at 19:15 - to get involved in so busted dailys of many students.
For the first time in the six seasons that Maura spent at the trainer's position in Westwood, the Bruins training camp begins a week before last year and training is limited during the summer semester. It also has its impact on this decision to limit the number of trainings from two to one daily.
A total of 18 trains are scheduled until 20 August, starting formal preparations for the first fight against Texas A&M, which is held in September.
It must have been heard that it supports the NCAA decision, although it added another item to the already loaded playlist.
"Three or four days are players under high stress and it is very exhausting for them," said Mora.
"But no one gave up, everyone's trying. They're great.
I think Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
UCLA will be closed after the completion of the training camp, which will not be easy to see the clear lines of surrounding lands from the nearby parking and luxury hotel Luskin Center, which has been acquired by the players after the scratch of the protective network behind the valve.
The Bruins players should take the hotel to start this week, but Mora admits that when the rooms are empty during the season, there might be a problem.
“The land will be guarded by the security service”, added Mora.
“The security is provided, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our training.
It's a good deal with such material.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security as well as the parking lot of 8.
We'll use for the maximum of our funds.
I believe everything's going to be fine.
It's all planned."
Facebook plans a more detailed check of facts to limit the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially false articles to control third parties and show findings under the original contributions in trying to fight the so-called “fake news”, the largest social network on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company writes that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes that will send to third parties to verify and potentially display the results of the research under the original contributions.
Facebook was designated as one of the main sources of false reports and many believe that these unconfirmed reports have affected the president's election last year.
In Europe, political debates are being discussed. French voters are flooded by false reports on May presidential elections, and Germany plans to put a penalty on the social media network if it is not quickly removed from the anger contributions.
On Thursday, in its next declaration issued in Germany, Facebook stated that it is about to start testing the new function of the control of fake messages in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"Besides showing the reports verified by third parties, people ask for more content to be better information and to be able to decide exactly what they can share," said Sara Su, the product reporting manager of Facebook.
She added that Facebook continues to test the function "related articles" and also works on other changes to reduce the number of false reports.
Graphical novel creation: story of A Castle in England
The small castle Scotney Castle recently played a major role in the music video of the Squeeze group and also found its shelter in it during the 1970s and 80s.
Scotney, however, was a witness for 700 years from his comfortable place at Bewl River in Britain Kent, a violent history, which inspired a cold Jamie Rhodes from the York County - known in the historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
"The view of the letter of a man who has been 300 years after death fascinates me," says Rhodes with a serious face.
"When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel personal connection."
The graphical novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families who lived in the castle Scotney from the middle century to the Eduardov period. Each story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkyewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first Rhodes book of inspired archives: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), the collection of inspired documents of the British Library - a project that was very emotional to him.
"I was taken by a fingerprint on a letter written by a double agent in the '70s who worked for Jacobies," he said.
"This is his fingerprint!
And the letters always smell like a smoke, because in those days you had to burn a candle.
If I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How much I love the archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, support is from the National Trust and Arts Council of England and the possibility of staying nearly four months in the castle almost like a dream.
Rhodes spent time studying the Victorian “new ” castle, exploring archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of hyena on the walls and bottles that have been thrown over centuries in the jam.
He walked around the land and examined the ruins of the old castle, talked to the hines, gardeners, and sometimes with artists who worked on illustrations to his book.
At night, he “sook whiskey and wrote. ”
The confidential history of Scotney is relatively large unknown, since the National Trust organization has obtained access to documents until in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the employees began to break into the archives that Rhodes described by words, as if “the aristocrats of many centuries were throwing away with the words: ‘ Get it into the ceiling. ’ ”
The diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps representing property: "You may think the dispute about land is boring," said Rhodes, "but I ran into one case when two families were dragging over the belly.
Stop it, people!"
Some stories in the book use the castle as a remarkable bridge and go deeper into the English history, including the story called The Labourer, who follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English rebellion in 1381.
"I found a record of the rebellion on the castle of 1380, which was called Knightly Familys of Kent and Sussex," said Rhodes.
“The English rebellion actually began in this area and I thought the rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe it's somehow connected."
Other stories are firmly linked to the castle history - for example The Priest, who tells the story of the Jezuit priest whom Darrell's family hides for seven years during the English reformation.
Or The Smuggler about the 18th century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who reportedly emphasized his own funeral when he filled the stone coffin (that was found a few years later after the discovery of the trumpet).
Rhodes’ favorite family are Darrell’s: “I was fascinated by men’s generations — men then were always debted and spent money for things they couldn’t afford.
Different generations of the Darrell family were dealing with it by taking rich or old virgins -- I imagine they were the gentlemans who loved to whisper their heads to their inheritants."
With the end of stay at the castle, Rhodes is searching for other adventures.
Recently he returned from a two-week stack in the Finnish wilderness where he inspired his next book about Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the beginning of the 20th century, which was absorbed by nature.
But it's a special place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I said to myself, "So I'm going to go back to real life."
Washington changes the conditions of granting a green card
The media published President Donald Trump's words on the new U.S. immigration plan, in which there will also be a change in giving green card.
It is assumed that the number of legal immigrants will fall by 50,000 annually, as a result of more strict rules for the provision of temporary work visas and family visa restrictions.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The draft of the law will soon be submitted to Congress.
“This law reduces poverty, increases the remuneration and saves billions of dollars for taxpayers. We aim to change the rules of issue of green cards to the inhabitants of other countries.
The law limits the number of immigrants and replaces the current scheme.
The new application process prefers the English speaking applicants who have funded and demonstrated the ability to benefit our country," said Trump, quoted media.
Sexual robots are on rise - we should be careful
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be bizarre, a report on the technology development of sexual robots will appear on the Internet.
Yes.
Sexual robots are now really popular.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former robotics professor and artificial intelligence at the Sheffield University and the FRR founder Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to take serious consideration of the rise of sexual robots.
Customers can choose the color of their eyes, the shape of nipples and the look of robot's nails.
"People are making fun of them, but sales are growing and we must be prepared to see them more often," Sharkey said at the opportunity to publish the report.
Modern sexual associates are transformed from pushing gentleman to robotic women with a silicon skin, which is pleasantly warm to touch - of course, it is artificial intelligence that imitates human behaviour.
The user can "mode" robot to the image of his own - from the color of the eyes and shape of nipples to the look and color of the nails.
Of course, it is very disturbing that many robots have their own “personity ” that would shame the Stepford Pani.
Modern pushing virgins developed in robotic women with sylicone skin.
The owner of the Robot RealBotix can set up various characteristics to his replacement wife, including shyness.
And then there's a sexual robotic woman Roxxxy Gold company True Companion, which is supplied with advanced programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah", which is characterized by a shameful nature and "violent Wendy" with "private" nature.
"Roxxxy Gold is set to fit your personality as possible," says True Companion on the website.
So she likes what you like and on the contrary.
She's even in a mood, as well as people.
She can be tired, calling or being “in the mood. ”
The rise of sexual robots is alarming right now for several reasons - between which there is no substitute for real inter-human relations. The disturbing are rather subtracted women's characteristics and violent implications - for example fregid (reading resistance) Farrah.
True Companion on its website illustrates Roxxxy as a vibrator for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have Roxxxy?", she says on the page.
However, sexual robots are not just fetish or sexual aid.
Their emergence and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - the departure from the ideal or sexual equality towards the desire for submanital sex with a selective enthusiasm.
Most men do not buy a robotic woman, and while the FRR speaks of their growing favorites, sexual robots remain at the edge of the public's interest.
However, this border interest may become a mirror set by modern times.
And most people aren't creepy or violent until they have a free market.
There is no chance that these sophisticated sexual robots appear at the time women around the world gain their rights, and in the White House the president is sitting at the woman's address, which is often very embarrassed.
The most horrible aspect of the series The Story of the servant is not what we see - hanged bodies and scratched eyes, rather the reality of these visions.
The book proposal The Story of the Servant represents a step in the right direction, but at present it seems to be a small step.
Sexual robots are to be similar to real women as possible as possible (you need porn heroic measures).
Their creators design them so that they are pleasant to touch and act at first sight as a real woman.
However, when their “personity comes to, ” the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They don't have a job or a history, anything that would incite their independence or interfere with their devotion to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
Greek 21st century: servants.
NBA star on the green arm.
Curry's fighting in California for cutting.
The star basketballist Stephen Curry didn't lose his first shot at the Prime Minister's start between professional golfists.
Double Assessment Holder for the most useful NBA player played at the Ellie Mae Classic tour below the Web.com Tour in California Hayward first bike on 74 wounds and will fight for cutting.
The Golden State player, who received a second title with the Warriors team in NBA, began very nervously and his first blow ended up in a drinking holder in a golf cart parked at the fairway.
Even after that, he was not as accurate as under the basketball basketball basketball basketball, yet he left a dozen professionals with a balance of four wounds over a couple.
"It was not an ideal way to start, to have to call the judge right after the first blow, but then it sat a little," Curry said with a huge tremor on him.
It was very nervous to blow the first shot at the tournament, but it was all I was hoping for.
"If you told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it immediately," he added.
If Curry succeeds in fighting with a cut that is likely to be set two wounds under pair, he will become the first representative of another sport that can do it on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time and now, when I got rid of the treme, it might be possible," said an excited golfist who played on the tournaments of celebrites and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
He starts the first time in Hayward at the PGA tournament.
In order to participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he obtained a sponsorship exemption and preserved amateur status.
The Web.com Tour is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big victory?
In contrast, Mitt Romney is a healthy mind.
The indispensable sign of Trump's era becomes political divisions that divide American voters and also micro-measures all families.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving, it was in American newspapers incorporated with advice to deal with relatives who choose Trump.
We're just supposed to be waiting for it to allow us nerves.
However, less attention is devoted to Trump’s family's ability to stumble.
I'm talking about it because this week my cousin, my cousin, visited me in New York -- a poet and a left fan who lives in Chicago, who has been paying for a republican fool for a long time in our family.
She reminded me that the emotion of the face of a common enemy could have a strong effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, suddenly, the whole family -- including all the Republican cousins with whom politics has been hasted for years -- is on one wave.
At dinner at the family table, it's a good thing; but it freaks me that in a broader context, it represents a significant risk.
Trump is reinforcing the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
If we're talking about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the scary possibility that his knocks can lose their attractions one day.
However, there is even more horrible long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the right republicans, who, in contrast with its standards, will suddenly be the embodiment of what can be called racional.
In these today, with the nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitta Romney and his version of the crazy deal - a dog on the roof of the car, 14% tax from income ( at least we had awareness of his tax confession) - of which both examples look compared to Trump as a very mild offence.
After the departure of Trump, it will be sufficient for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be an enormous improvement.
We used my cousin's visits and we took the children to Central Park to the largest circuit that operates the New York Parks - for your three dollars you can't find a better use if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the middle war is covered by glass - clowns and animals are filming and they look at their own shoulders - a totally dark view and puzzle music of coupon resembles public transport.
Many cliche will soon frozen: the view from the high buildings, the panorama is watching, instead of breathing with the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get your imaginations.
Fifty-fifty years later, I still didn't pass myself over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not actually a Swiss cheese - not counting thematic bedroom Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but the metro station in London.
However, the Central Park circle causes extraordinarily magic experience, to the extent that two two two-year-old children have great fun on it, as well as two mature women.
If I could evaluate the circle, he would have earned the maximum points, but fortunately no one asks.
This week I experienced the same experience in the shop when I was asked to evaluate my "relief" on the scale from one to five.
In my street's corner cafe, it's the same, with the difference that I can make an estimate of 15% of the drinking for something I'm buying behind the pulp.
Not only is that it slows the rapid sale otherwise, but the waitress is so forced to get into the favor of buyers when it's not necessary.
A woman in the smile shop excused me when I was unwilling to evaluate my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transported from prison to hospital due to chest pain
This is the second time Pistorium had to be transferred to the hospital.
Last year he was treated with cutting wrist wounds that, according to the prison statement, caused himself to fall in the cell.
The Pistorius was convicted of murder after the appeal against the original sentence for murder.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in early mornings at Valentine in 2013 with a few shot wounds through the doors of the toilet box in his house in Pretoria.
The Pistorius claimed you were wrong with the thief.
The prosecutors announced their intention of reappearance, this time against the six-year penalty of Pistorius, which according to their words is too modest.
The National Prosecuting Authority stated that it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and that the judicial proceedings would be carried out this year.
In the case of success, Pistorium's prolongation of the penalty is threatened for up to 15 years.
In the South African Republic, death penalty is not paid.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a young panda in captivity, who was in the wilderness.
The program for the saving of pand is a huge success.
Because the Centre is trying to expand the genofond pand in captivity.
The worker of the Centre Chang Č-chung told the New China agency that the pand's behaviour is a big risk of a relative crossing.
In captivity, only 471 pands lived at the end of last year.
Only two thousand of them are survived in the free nature.
The attempt to allow captured pands with those wild people to be the first step to help the pand behaviour protect this kind.
The 15-year-old Cchao-cchao was released to the natural reservation at the beginning of the pandy pairing period on 11 March.
Thanks to the tracking device on the neck, scientists could watch every step.
His elected Cchao-chao met 12 days later.
Sexual relationship with a pandy male lasted a minute and half and was successful.
It can also be considered a miracle, because the pandy males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal empire.
The males are quite badly estimated when the females are ready, they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
Young people were born healthy, and even since Chao-Chao had extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, it was worth 216 grams after birth.
The average weight of the newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in Greece for illegal camping, BTV quoted.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, was detained by the Sithony police in the morning.
They were all released the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said for BTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have strengthened the rules of free camping and store strict penalties to all who are caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
The checks are going to take over the whole season.
The Ministry stated that the court could render a penalty.
Spilk's at the first round of British Open in the fifty-fifth place.

The score in the Kingsbarns score was one hit under a pair when she played three birds and two boheys.
Twenty-two-year-old Czech player so hopes that the famous Major will first go through a cut.
The entry into a grant with $3.25 million came out of the best American star Michelle Wiea, who won the first bike in the 64-wound record, which is eight under a pair.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are downloading millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has already closed 180 poultry for the incident.
The Netherlands Authority for Food Safety of NVWA reported that it is investigating 20% of all Dutch poultrymen, which he considers that 80% of the eggs are inconvenient on the market.
The Authority emphasized that the risk represents only a limited number of types of eggs recognised by specific numbers.
According to German authorities, the quantity of toxic substance in eggs is small, and for adults it is not a risk, but potential threat is for children.
The Czech SVS speaker Peter Mayer noted that the eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities joined the closure of the behaviour, recently had not imported to Czech Republic.
Nevertheless, the veterinarians will take the samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, whose markets have been found insecticide.
The eggs from Belgium have been according to the Czech market veterinary management last in April and the Netherlands' eggs last in May.
The chicken meat from Belgium was last shown in Czech Republic in June.
But there is a certain amount of chicken meat in the Netherlands in Czech Republic.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of the anti-flow products, everything and slippers.
However, it is not possible to administer animals that are consumed by people.
The World Health Organization of the WHO considers the preparation mildly toxic.
His high doses lead to disturbance and disturbance.
Riga's beautiful, I'm gonna miss her, says the golman Sedlack, looking for an engagement.
I'd still like to catch ten years.
"Maybe I'll be back there once," a 27-year-old Sedlack smiles, who could start a season in the Zlinski Dress.
It's important if he gets an engagement at the start of a new year.
What were the four years you've experienced in Latvia?
If I had to evaluate it as at school, then in three.
I didn't catch much for the first year, I had an experienced goal in front of me.
I was studying.
The next year I started catching.
Before the third season, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought a new goal I've been with.
Last year, I assumed I'd be catching all the time.
But during the starting ten matches, we may have only got five points, so the coaches started to film it.
At the end, my colleague caught more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it for the next season.
How was life in Riza?
Beautiful.
It's a little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historical town.
I'll miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, we'll be married next year.
So I got something.
How difficult is KHL for the branners?
The first ten teams are really quality.
Then there are men like us or the Slovak who must change their game style against them.
The skill is on the other hand, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, more fighting.
I didn't see a problem in the width of the field.
The difference is, the Russians want to play empty.
They're less shooting, and even though they have a half-purpose gate ahead, they're more likely to record.
There's only more shooting in Czech Republic.
Didn't you have a problem with traveling and moving over seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's no problem.
He can sleep calmly.
The program is usually done so you play four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do Lothis even feel about their KHL club?
As a national team.
The whole Latvia is watching hockey, together with basketball is a national sport.
Everybody's fancy.
Even though it didn't, there were a lot of people walking.
Has Dinam's impact in KHL helped that Latvia in this year's world championship almost entered the quarterfinal?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo is there from the beginning.
And since the same time, their results have started to go up on the world's championship.
On Olympiada 2014 in Sochi, they fell in the quarterfinal with Canada closely 1:2.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they got to a higher level.
Still more lottery players are heading to the Czech extraligy.
In Zlina, Roberts Bukarts was set up and before the contract was signed, Ralphs Freibergs.
What's the way so many of them come here?
They're not any beach players, they're really quality.
These teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Lotitis belongs to them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still not engaged?
At the beginning of February, I knew I wasn't going to continue in Riza.
This fall, we started looking for something.
There was Sparta on the table.
But because they didn't have a goal budget, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was classic.
We talked to different teams, but in the final, they decided for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlyna and I'll wait for something to come up.
You're not nervous about that?
That was four years ago when I left here and I didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I'm home for a while.
I got something in KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The only question is when and where I'll sign it.
How real is the option that you're going to run a new year in Zlyna?
Anything can happen.
Let's see what's going to happen in a month.
Now I can just wait for the agent to arrange.
Do you prefer any competition?
The past season wasn't that much that I could choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government's departure of the Flight continues.
In January this year, I wrote about the camp in the Orlic Lets.
The principle of the problem remains the same, so I will allow the difficult paragraphs of the article to be recalled.
It's been talked about a camp in the Air For years.
For readers who don't know exactly what it is, it is probably best to look at the official cultural pages of Pietnam instead of the Flight.
There, in the introduction of the historical review, it is learned that the camp was two miles east of the city of the Flight, that since 8.1940 he served as a work camp, since 1.1942 he was a collective camp, and since 2.8.1942 became a Cyclan camp.
The next text describes the progress of life in the camp, including the non-human conditions, until March 1943, when the first air prisoners were included in an auspicious transport.
On 4.5.1943, 370 persons were transported by the largest transport to the exhaust camp.
A total of them was 420.
Very sad history of the enormous distress of human beings that caused them again of human beings and distorted ideology.
There is no dispute that these events must be kept in mind.
There is no dispute that this reminder should occur at the monument in the place of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
For socialism, somehow, the camp was a little forgotten, and in the 1970s, he was built nearby and in part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was randomly discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, a monument was discovered in 1995.
In the mid - 90 ’ s, the government promised the ransom and collapse, but so far did not.
In 1998, the monument was declared as a cultural memorial and since 2009 it has fallen under the Memorial of Lidice.
In July 2013, the United Nations Committee for Human Rights called on the Czech Republic to close the veprin.
So short facts about the warfare of the camp.
On the autumn of the autumn, the government approved the buying of veprina and decided that an expert assessment for the price should be drawn up.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, then the government will buy it.
According to Herman's Culture Minister, "some numbers exist, but I guess I would have dreamed of those intentions if I went to public with them."
Let's see what a professional assessment will bring.
According to some unofficial estimates, there may be hundreds of millions, others say the price can reach a billion.
Anyway, it won't be cheap.
And only a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a monument in which the State had invested nearly ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the United Nations Committee for Human Rights funded the whole transaction, which is obviously not threatening, it would, in my opinion, be the same dismissal of money.
Does the government not have other priorities?
The monument, the dignity of the place of pete, stands the will of history practically in the immediate nearby of the tragedy and anyone who wants, can be worshiped here by a memorial of the suffering and murdered.
I can't see any reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is, and let's keep the place of petition with maximum caution.
In this case, the Government of the Czech Republic should deal with the care of the proper economy as well as with the money of taxpayers.
At least with one like in his own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Vice-President of the Government is not the entire government.
But I still take it from the above-mentioned facts the leader's password of the ANO movement only as an empty electoral proclamation.
This year, in May, I went straight to the place.
Very decent arrival, adjusted parking lots, wooden camps replicas.
In one exposure, in the second integrated toilet with liquid water.
A small natural amphitheater with the possibility of seating and with a view to its own place of petry, which is made of stones placed in a mild hill.
A lot of flowers and veins.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, as it suits and belongs.
Currently, archaeological research is being conducted in the place of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, part of the discovered foundations could be conserved and at least visually accessible.
That way, the Minister of Culture, Daniel Herman, could make his efforts.
If he manages to make the government a ransom for state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his functioning as the Minister of Culture.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate may mitigate the symptoms of inflammatory infection (IBD)
For your rehearsal system, red meat and milk products may be a nightmare.
The new study, however, suggests the right opposite: food rich on animal protein and milk products could help to relieve from the symptoms of inflammatory abdominal disease.
The unhealthless disease that affects up to 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 patients in Britain causes abdominal pain and bleeding diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
Patients are usually reminded not to use meat and milk products to mitigate symptoms. However, researchers of the Washington University found that the essenceal amino acid triptofan contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that support the resistance of the womb.
The leading study, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells protect the womb and ensure the disposal of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced with the number of cells supported by tolerance and protecting the body without damageing the sensitive tissue.
Once the bowls of the wags are on the side of the inflammation, there may be an inflammatory infection of the infantry.
In research, scientists found the presence of immune cells supporting body tolerance in the mice stomach with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the creation of cells the presence of triptophane - one of the construction blocks of proteins.
Professor Colonna said: “We have found a connection between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of the intestinal microbium and the development of cells supported by body tolerances.
The more triptophane have the mouses in their food, the more these immune cells have."
At the same time, he suggested that if it turns out that the same applies to humans, then the combination of L. reuteria and foods rich on triptofan would help to develop a more tolerable and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Postgradual researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, during a study of a kind of immune cells supporting body tolerance, discovered that one group of testing mouses had these cells, while the second group of the same mice kept separately missing the cells.
It led to the fact that one mouse group has a different intestinal microbiom - a community of bacteria, viruses, and beans that are usually living in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse tree was tested by the DNA classification method and researchers found six types of bacteria in the mouse with immune cells missing by the second mouse group.
The mouse, which was kept in the sterile environment and they lacked the intestinal microbium - so they didn't develop this type of immune cells - was given to the L. reuteri bacteria - and they created immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affects the immune system, researchers raised L. reuters in liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without bacteria - unproducted immune cells stored in isolation.
Immune cells have developed into tolerant cells.
After removing the active substance from the fluid, it was shown that the side product of triptophane metabolism known as indolyl-3-oct acid.
When researchers doubled the quantity of triptophane in mouse food, the number of these cells increased by 50 percent. After the distribution of the doses of triptophane decreased by half the number of cells.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as the mouse and most of us keep the L. reuter in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known if adverse products of triptophane from L. reuteria caused the development of cells in humans the same way as in mouse, but the defects in triptophane-related genes have been found in people with inflammatory abnormalities.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Everyone of us should probably seek to develop these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the womb.
The potentially high level of triptophane in the presence of the L. Reuteri bacteria can increase the population of cells."
José Mourinho considers the signing of the Treaty with Non-Matic and its transition to Manchester United as “genial”
Manchester United got into his "geny" team in the form of Nemanja Matice - at least that's what José Mourinho thinks after the booker debuted in the middle fight against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed a contract for 40 million pounds, introduced the first match of winning 2:1 in Dublin - the last seasonal struggle before the UEFA SuperShop, where the United met with Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira in his role.
However, since he did not attend the team's pre-session Asian tour, Matić had no form and only played 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinha, the next season of Premier League must be worked before the start of the next season.
"It takes time, but it is experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant thought - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get into the condiction as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new fellow players Victor Lindelöf and Romel Lukak also played the first match at the Aviva Stadium and Mourinho starts slowly forming its eleven for another season.
Independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with three other players, but insists that the club has done “fantastic work” and has brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank the club for helping me get three of the four players," he added.
“Four of four would please me more, but I admit they made the maximum for me. ”
The challenge of the king of chicken skins Ladie Hrushka.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The multipromising image began to be drawn through a new TV show on Prima Zdeňkova Academy.
The humming rained the chance right away.
"Dear Zden, I'd like to join your cooking academy with this, because I think I can learn a lot from you," he called him in a social network video.
And since two of you've been up for a few years, the Lady didn't forget to irritate him even this time.
"In return, I can teach you a sweat from the diet chicken meat, an American cucumber or invite you to water and show you why it's the favorite baked cheese," he screwed up.
His participation in Pohlreich's new show is really serious.
It's time to move a level higher and learn from the master.
"The question is what the boss is to do," he said to the Flash.
But Pohlreich did not express himself because he filmed the new parts of his next show, yes, boss!
Only Prima responded to the participation of the Gross at the Kuiner Academy, taking the whole matter as its personal activity that goes outside the TV.
He planted a big wound to Hruška Pohlreich in December 2004 with his first cook.
In a few days, more than 300 thousand pieces have been sold to her!
The new show that Prima presented yesterday at the press conference for the autumn transmission scheme is an unfake cooking school.
Pohlreich chooses his students from a number of viewers, and in twelve parts, they are acquainted with twelve cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show Now the boss cooks in November 2014, Zdenek left the back of his trick to squeeze the overcrowded garlic.
If he had my face there, I'd laugh a lot.
"I'm just smiling at that garlic - the gross is a healthy fruit and has plenty of vitamins," Láđa responded.
He's thinking about the Led's culinary art.
"Cooking according to Ladie Hrushka doesn't come into consideration either at home, because I'm not going to take a gastropunk home," he clearly has the boss.
I appreciate Pohlreich's daily, even according to him, I'm making honey chicken.
But in my show, his prescriptions will certainly not appear," he did not forgive himself, Hruška.
He's an asshole!
He's not a cook for me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomic analphabet or asshole," Pohlreich said about Hrushk at a lecture.
"I'm not 20 to be able to wave my hands over them, but I'm not dealing with them anymore," he stated on the account of the insults of Hrushka.
The British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock the car and the house by waving
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip intake in the body. A simple waving of his hand can unlock the door from the house and office and even launch the car.
Thirty-year-old Steven Northam had a small chip implanted between the finger and the indicators and currently offers the same service through his BioTeq company to companies and individuals who want to simplify their life through technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, anesthesiologist of Royal Hampshire County, observes the procedure for implantation and compliance with treatment procedures.
Technology works on the same principle as microchip implanted to dogs and cats and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a service to exchange door locks and cars compatible with the microchip. The price of one castle is 300 £.
A married father of a child had technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which would start with a simple whispering hand.
The requisition of the White House cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The decision of the White House to arrive with a navy helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the American production industry that took place last month came according to the navy records issued by the TIME week, at $24,000.
The green white helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the top of the programme of 17 July in the White House, which was a view of American constructive programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and several high officials of the White House were looking at the sight of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter from Connecticut was exhibited next to the Maine yacht, the fire car from Wisconsin and a vilicatic wheelchair from Mississippi.
The military officer of the White House issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and asked for the presence of a helicopter for less than 36 hours before the landing of the helicopter to South Lawn in the “extreme” event, reported the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - units responsible for the management of the helicopter.
"I wanted to make sure that you are aware of such an important event," Commander HMX-1 wrote in an email to his supervisor, the Navy Commander for Air Force Day before the event was launched.
The report suggested that the helicopter will arrive at South Lawn 17 July at approximately 7 a.m. to the occasion of a show, whose start is scheduled at 3:00 and remains in place until the complete cleaning of the whole place that was planned between 6:00 and 21:00 p.m.
The e-mail further stated that, if a delay occurs at the time of leaving the White House, the replacement crew will be sent for the flights due to the labour time regulations.
The original crew remained on the spot that night with the helicopter and with them the security unit.
From the records - which the TIME week received - was not evident if the second crew was finally sent.
The Hatch Act prevents state officials from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible violations of this Regulation.
"We wondered if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was fine," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like they blocked you," said the representative of the commander.
This show “Made in America” was called the White House as an official event and Hatch Act would therefore not apply to it.
But also official events have political subtexts.
In his participation in the event, the President promoted a health reform that was passing through the Senate and discussed an effort to maintain the government regulation.
The use of aircraft such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
The presidents use them for travel.
However, their presence is unusual for presentation reasons.
Trump ordered inspection in February after the presidential plane drove in the background of his first meeting in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is covered by complaints about the use of the presidential plane of his precedent.
“The White House is pleased with the show“Made in America”, represented by the products of all 50 countries produced by the Americans from American materials”, said the representative of the press secretary Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landing in Washington and South Lawn and train possible arrivals with President of the United States to the White House with maximum precision.
While Trump attended the summit of G-20 in July, HMX-1 took 58 exercise landings at the White House.
The flight at Made in America was part of the current crew training, stated the state factor.
The helicopter unit in the same day ran into “non-Presidential support missions” for another 11 hours.
The White House stated that no other requisitions were paid from taxpayers' money.
The speaker Sikorsky stated that the company was not interested in negotiations on the exhibition of the helicopter on South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not contain the budget records for presidential flights and the exact costs in relation to the show, according to the navy's expression, is difficult to determine.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hour price for the fiscal year 2017, the amounts of DOD for VH-3D 24 380 $ per flight hour.
The units records give time 30 minutes from the marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are moving significantly under that amount.
"Amounting taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimates for expenses is very intriguing," Walters told the whole matter.
“These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs, which are included in the annual costs.”
According to RAND’s 2015 supplementary expenditure does not include the burden of staff, but includes the price of fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
The former press secretary of the White House Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the purposes of the show.
"The idea of showing this week is to present the products produced in the United States," Spicer said.
"I am aware that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the protection of our state and that they provide work to hundreds of people, not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and the other military devices that are involved in the production of countless American citizens.
This reality is suitable to remind."
It is not clear if Trump was also looking at the helicopter at his business at South Lawn. With certainty only that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire cars.
Back in the White House Trump contacted the representative of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sykorsky very well," said the President, "I have three right now."
A young woman tied up in the moor near Mach's lake, and the police walked to her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday about 2:00 a.m.
But instead of bathing, she remained trapped in the wet.
When she decided to ask her mobile phone for the police's help, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"For that reason, the police soon lost their connection with her," said police speaker Ivana Balacová.
A number of police patrols went to the spot that she nearly described, but finding a young woman was not easy.
"Some cops have had to be floating by a hundred meters of racos moisture before they felt a solid ground again," Balacová approached.
Likewise, she was missing.
The police were oriented according to the direction from which her call for help.
"To not lose at least this connection, they agreed with her that she would count loudly," the speaker said.
The police found a woman at three quarters to five in the muds in Borne's place.
She was on the edge of physical and mental forces and showed signs of coldness.
That's why the invoked ambulance took her to the Czecholip hospital.
Grandpa's connection to Stan?
The bride's requested becomes a selling girl.
That's a little ironic.
As if a billionaire told the voters that the STAN suffers from a deficit of deficit of decent people.
And he also claimed that politically unborn party rather less famous mayors and independent, in fact, does not have a full-State programme for the elections.
Her election candidate will just become a decent man after an interview with Grandpa, whatever political opinion she has.
This was the way Vit Bart started, and it didn't work very well.
In addition, the Grandpa disrupts the favorite argument of the head of the State that the greatest value of movement is the political examination and experience of the mayor, the traditionally favorite politics, as well as according to the research.
Now they're relieving the rapidly collected unknown characters.
The total diversion with humans, after which STAN changed the logo and slogan, Gazdík explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity in human candidates.
But if the state of identity suspected only a few of them at that time, after Grandpa arrived, it's just a game of identity.
Not only the Gazdík has long been defined against ANO Andrea Babiša, but the Grandpa, who has publicly praised Grandma, said: "My goal is to make the movement of ANO, then the move of the Mayors gained twenty percent in the coming elections."
Let's hope he didn't make a mistake.
Grandpa is a successful businessman, and a billionaire is certainly not a coincidence.
He often talks about politics like Babish, but he will not be his own political mark.
Stan has been reminding a reality show for a while rather than a real political party, and Grandpa's helpful hand as if she had made a more selling girl from the bride requested.
For a while, Stan went with ToP 09, then with people, and now he's looking for a change to make good people.
Let's hope someone gets in touch.
Police dogs practiced helicopter flights in Bridge
The dogs specialized for searching explosives and search dogs trained today at the lake of the Bridge to fly with a helicopter.
The police dog must not be creepy and be afraid of flying, said Peter Tomaszek, chief of the Police Cinologists of the Ustec Region.
The police dog training takes about two years.
At the Bridge, they trained both adult dog training, and those who are just going through training.
In addition to the standard training that they were to discover in the area of the lake, sharp samples of explosives and search for lost figurant, all 12 animals had to enter the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So as soon as the helicopter reaches, the dog could go to work so that he wouldn't have a problem with the way of the helicopter.
"The helicopter, the dog goes and searches immediately," said Tomaszek.
The dog that is unslowful or the helicopter is unable to start working immediately, is excluded from training.
"Then most of them keep them in the garden, for example," Tomahek added.
The police have 76 dogs with different specializations in the Ustec region.
The German sheep are prevailing, but also belgic sheep.
The dog has taken care of him since the puppies.
"He is preserving him himself, preparing him for the service that the dog will do for us," added Tomaszek.
The animal is passed through repeated veterinary tests that may reveal any health disabilities.
If the dog is healthy and vulnerable, it consists of the first tests in 20 months.
"It gets about two and a half or three years to a sharp hit," Tomaszek added.
The duration of the police depends on the dog's health condition.
Most of them serve in eight to ten years.
They live mostly with their psychiatrists.

According to the United Nations, Afghan Democracy relies on women in politics
The elections can only be valid if all members of the company, including women, are presented in the middle of the UN representative in Afghanistan.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN Assistant Mission, said that elections to local representatives are attended by hundreds of women, three women are the Vice-President post and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overlooked”, he stated in his medium statement.
The elections can be fully representative and confidential only if women participate in them, as well as all related processes that relate to the elections.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on 5 April.
The Taliban has issued several threats against the election process that move international fighting to the second row.
In this year's elections, at all, the first time one democraticly elected government transmits its power peacefully to the next government.
Haysom stated that the strong roles of women will strengthen the democracy of Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission stated that a total of 3.6 million registered voters constituted 1.2 million women.
Unique beer cooks again beer.
For a good beer to a resurrected beerware.
The excitement and honesty of the new owners returned to life a few years ago in Lobči's place.
The beer mentioned for the first time in 1586 has a renewable core and has been converted into a panoramic operation in the 19th century.
It followed years of flower, when the beerware was famous mainly with dark beers.
Unfortunately, during the second world war, production was stopped and in 1984 the beerware was nationalized.
Since then, the buildings served the state ship.
The part of the destruction was done by the owners of the beerware after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and discussed on construction material.
In 2007, however, new hopes were made up in the form of new owners, architects of Jana and Paul Prouz.
They started repairing buildings with the greatest respect for the spirit of building and every detail.
They carefully devoted themselves to study archive materials, trying to preserve original materials and construction elements.
Beer has the same form as in the 19th century when his golden era began.
Their work was evaluated by the statement of beerware for the cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the construction became part of the European Industrial Heritage Paths.
In 2015 they also renewed the tradition of cooking beer.
If you want to taste a great skull beer in the picturesque landscape of Cokorinska, visit the exhaustion in the area of beerware.
In cooking beer, they use cocorin water in protected landscapes, sweets from the skull fields, and chatetic chmel.
You'll taste a traditional light bed, but even dark beer and specials.
And don't let you miss a beer check, it's going on Saturday and Sunday on noon and half seconds.
The biggest artillery firm of Czechoslovakia?
One of the biggest fortress of their type in the world?
This was the unique construction of Stachelberg between Trutnov and Jacler, on the top of the territorial backyard above the village of Baba.
It was originally to form up to twelve bunkers connected with a large underground.
Here should have been command, casino, ammunition storage, material, electricity, machinery and hospitals.
But the Monache Agreement terminated the construction.
In less than a year, the only powerful iron-beton bunker was able to build and underground spaces have been broken.
Thanks to the enthusiasts from the Stachelberg, who started reconstructing the unique building in the early 1990s, you can also look here.
The underground is already available from 75 percent!

Know the plant with one click.
A new free Pl@ntNet application will be helped to students with herbs and ordinary plant lovers.
When they are interested in what plant they have just met on a walk, these applications will advise them.
The only thing they're going to have to do is photograph the plant, and the application itself recognizes what kind it is.
The new application available for iOS and Android was presented to representatives of the Centre of Ethics and Environmental Education of the CEEV in the Bratislav Mountain Park as part of the city's Secret Life project.
The project has also been included by students from 50 Czech and Slovenian schools who photographed and added plants from their surroundings with teachers in the application database.
The new French application created is free to download the City's Secret Life.
The main goal of the French programmers was to contribute as many people to the application by their images, and this increases the number of plants that the applications can recognize.
"So long as children that hold tablets or cell phones in their hands can go into the woods," the coordinator of this project, Ivan Polackov, said.
On the basis of a sufficiently quality photograph of the flower, sheet or plant fruit, applications can recognize its name within a few seconds, which will then in Czech and in Slovenia assign under the photograph.
The French have allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech into the project Secret Life of the city.
Therefore, it is welcome that users, after setting up an account, contribute to the application by an image of plant that is not yet presented in the database.
"Francouz will assess whether it is useful and then add it to the database," Polačková informed.
GMB concerns about investment in the McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The committees require guarantees from the managers of the manufacturer of cookies McVitie's long-term production obligations in the Glasgow factory.
The Scotland Union of GMB stated that the company is currently silent about any investment in the Tollcross factory.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, other than other products and cookies from Hobnob and Rich Tea.
The owner of McVitie, Pladis, said that in several previous years, she invested more than 5 million pounds in the entire area.
She added that employees and representatives of the Union will be “mean the first informed” in the case of changes in the operation of the factory.
In the letter to the builder, the Scottish boards of GMB expressed their concern that McVitie's “without its promises of financing and modernisation of production lines”.
The GMB organizer Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received a clear answer from the builder on the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very disturbing for our members.
There have been generations of many families and employees, mostly from the local community and the area of Glasgow, where the work in this factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social separation.
From the view of work, salaries and benefits - and despite the view of Brexit, increasing life costs and decreasing slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous producer, such as McVitie's."
Pladis, speaker, said: “The building Tollcross received a letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, since we appreciate the continuing commitment to the employees and representatives of the committees.
The regular meeting of employees and representatives of GMB in Tollcross took place two months ago, and this meeting was openly discussed with many problems.
We have spoken to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operation on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations, so that we can continue successfully competitively.
She added: “In recent years we have invested 5 million pounds in the Tollcross area, especially in production lines and operational efficiency.
We very appreciate the inheritance of Tollcross and localities, and if any changes in the operation of this factory will be informed immediately."
Did she warn Barcelona PSG about Neymar's movement three years ago?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain does not allow in its attempt to get Neimara on its side after she put 189 million £, that is the amount needed to buy Neimara from the contract, but warned this French team of Barcelona about its record invasion before three years ago?
This sensational transmission has developed the waters of summer offences. Club Ligue 1 is ready to overcome more than twice the previous record amount for Paul Pogby's transfer to Manchester United, who paid for it in last season 89 million £.
After confirmation and ending the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive world player and at the same time the best paid professional sportsman in the world - after taxation from the PSG team will be collected over $500,000 a week.
Barcelona is agitated by the way Neymar has emerged from his contract, despite the confidential source confirmed that the club has always tried to respond to Neymar in all since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world noted of this fact three years ago by the PSG President?
When Manchester City expressed his interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khalaifi warned all clubs that would be interested in taking over one of the best PSG players.
"I am not afraid, because once someone tries to get one of our players, we will definitely address one of their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they are trying to get one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seemed to have crossed the intentional border when she expressed her interest in the PSG Marca Verratti carrier in the summer.
PSG made it clear in the sense that, under no circumstances, it would not allow the Italian representative to leave. It is possible that Barcelona, for her triumphed dealings with the departure of Neyamara, now swallows a bitter pill.
Who explains the sanctions?
Does political punishment have widely understandable rules?
Donald Trump swimmed on the anti-Russian sanctions.
A day earlier, the United States has sanctioned Venezuela President Madura.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China is not doing anything with the North Korean threat and that it won't go any further.
Even from that, a more shoe idea of sanctions like a shoe sauce.
You can't throw these things into one bag.
Madur's Venezuela was really on her way to dictatorship, but not to the totality.
China doesn't just feel as the American President wishes.
Russia is a chapter for itself.
But if someone wanted to summarize it in a way that the ordinary voter, American, European or other, would understand what it is and what rules is based on the policy of sanctions, it would be almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump only approximates what President Obama has already prepared, only gave an implementing mark.
Then why such a disturbance?
Last year, Europe was afraid that if the American elections of Trump won, we will hug Putin and renounce sanctions.
It's a terrible idea.
But in practice, it's the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not released, but they're steady.
But Europe is scaring even more.
German Minister Zypries says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
It's like a cosser is only sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then they are not a cosser or the EU's anti-Russian sanctions.
The Chief of the European Commission, Juncker, again complains that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
It's like sanctions should only be used so weak that they don't threaten anyone?
Ordinary voter drowns.
For three years, he heard that the destiny of the anti-Russian sanctions depends only on the fulfilment of the Minsk Peace Agreements in Ukraine.
It is now learned that this is the EU's energy security.
The voter is drowning even wider.
There are sanctions for Russia because it's too mounted where it doesn't have it.
China is humiliated because it's a little mounted.
The Venezuel President is punished for building a dictatorship at the borders of his country.
All those punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see the system, the order or the rules in it?
Andrej Babish: I'm not considering cooperation with Okamura.
Andrej Babish married, crossed the Republic with his visionary book and finalized the election program.
Besides the Pardubian County, he's already finished all the candidates.
According to his words, he did not have much to interfere with them.
He even agreed to lead the Haitman and Shadow Minister of Education ANO Ivo Vondrak.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a messenger or a heitman," he confirmed his earlier opinion, Babish.
A lot of representatives and all-State politicians are pissed off your mind that directly elected mayors and primators should drive the villages and cities alone, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I'm a favourite of direct democracy, we're electing the president directly, and I'm convinced that we should vote both the mayors and the primators.
In my book, I'm not talking about disrupting representatives, they can be there.
The question is, how many will there be?
When I presented your book, what I dream about when I sleep, I heard you were talking about cancelling the substitute.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about direct choice and reduction in the number of representatives.
New York, with nine million inhabitants, has five districts and 51 representatives.
A threshold with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the primator's got a little to build and not prepare big projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same applies to the government that only two people, Klaus and Zeman, managed in our history.
I'm not saying they did it right.
The current Prime Minister doesn't control anything, he's just modifying the debate.
That's not how it works.
Is that why you're trying to make the most of the system?
It'd be perfect, but it's hard to figure it out.
In the program, we only have a change in one-collecting choice to the Senate.
We have also proposed a sliding mandate of the ministers and the modification of the Parliament's Rule of Procedure to prevent the useless exhibition of Members who are to work primarily in the committees and committees, not to be presented at the meetings of the Parliament.
It is definitely not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents fear.
That as a dictator you will run the government, control the Parliament with 101 Members, cancel the regions and the Senate, and through grateful mayors and primators you will control the entire country.
I'm sure it's not that way.
There's nothing wrong with debating about the number of messengers.
The French President Macron announced the reduction of the third legislative congregation, with 57,000 French lawmakers on one lawmaker, while this is a 17,000 Czech.
But no one blames Macrona for the threat of democracy.
Even if someone won elections mostly in Czech Republic, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making some dramatic changes.
But the funds for who has a parliamentary majority are large, just look to Poland or Hungary.
Nothing like that in the case of the ANO movement is not threatened.
We just need a team that will work for people in the government, not for their parties or resorts.
I don't understand, for example, why we have not agreed that only the payments of teachers, employees in culture and social services will be increased.
Why did they voting me over and add to 21 percent of the GIBS members who are already taking 60 grand?
Would you like a prime minister?
The Prime Minister is to be affected when the ministers are acting inadvertently, confusing the government with the travel office and for the money of the state would like to operate as Marian Jurečka who wanted to buy forests in Romania and soil in Africa.
Ministers in the government don't have to argue, they're supposed to argue out of it.
There must be complete material in the cabinet, there is no place for coalition breakdowns, force votes and businesses, there to decide.
How do you want to have a coherent team when the ministers are acting mainly parties?
There's a constitutional law over the sides.
When the bread was broken, Sabotka said that the coalition contract was not valid, and he left Babisa the government.
Any prime minister can do that.
But if it is a personality and has managing powers, the like plan gesture does not need.
It measures everyone equally and requires perfect performance from all.
Do you know who you'd suggest for the Minister of Finance?
I don't think about it, because we probably won't even be in that government, nobody wants to cooperate with us, even though I don't know what I've done so badly.
It's not that sceptic.
The mayors have gained an Grandfather's businessman who would like to cooperate with you, perhaps wins a wing of your favorite Jiri Chunk.
I don't think so.
CHSSD leads Lubomir Zaoralek, who does not exclude the coalition with ANO, may be prosecuted by Václav Klaus ml., which will also not be opposed.
I'd leave it on the voters.
Vice-President and Vice-President ANO Richard Brabec said you have many common points with SPD Tomia Okamury, for example in the economy.
So the coalic partners come into consideration?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he candided as Vita Barta's doll for VV, then gained money from the Dawn for his company, some pup ran there.
Of course, he is a significant personality.
Of course, some brown.
If I take his program, there is a wide involvement of people in society management, direct democracy, it can be agreed.
I'm not asking you that at all.
I'm wondering if a person who has xenophobic opinions is speaking on demonstrations with screws and wants to step out of the EU?
We don't consider cooperation with Mr. Okamura, I can't imagine.
It's obvious that he went to politics to profit from it.
What about the silent support of the communists to your minor government?
I can't imagine it, but they'll decide the voters.
It'll be about negotiating a winner with another in order, but God knows who will be the winner and who two.
Of course, it is important for them to be able to agree on the Coalition Government programme.
Let's go back to your attempt to become a company.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Saturday lets everything evade, never decided.
Coalitions such as CEB or EGAP did not work.
Because Saturday's his doll, and I think that's why he fired me.
Once he did it, Chaz controlled the Czech government.
It is unbelievable, however, that the Prime Minister has brought a resolution written by the management of CEZ, which puts the Minister of Finance on how to vote at the valuable set of ČEZ.
If you become Prime Minister, would you change your personal arrangements in the supervisory Council and exchange the top management of CEZ?
Jesus, if I am the Prime Minister, he'll see you.
I'm not yet.
It's rumour that CHEZ has already sent signals to your direction.
He would like to exchange good cooperation with the CSSD for even better with ANO.
Well, then, after the elections, it'll all go on again.
I don't know anything about it.
I don't have any humble lobby or Rose, I'm a single unit, and I'm not dealing with this at all.
So answer directly.
If you are headed by the government, will you seek to exchange the leadership of CEZ, the Czech Television or the General Health Insurance, i.e. the institutions you criticize?
I'd like to make CHEZ a transparency company.
So far, you've been doing what he wanted for years, thanks to the traditional political parties.
All you need to do is look into Mr. Schwarzenberg's words.
Although he's supposed to stand in the CEZ majority, he's never driven him, he's only in the number, which's wrong.
It's a trivial thing for me.
CZEZ should take Dukovans, evaluate them, put them into a daughter's company, arrange funding, make a supplier competition or get a coinvestor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the State is to finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And the Czech TV?
Some of her shows are leading a permanent goal campaign against me, but I don't have and I won't have any competence to dismiss.
But to control yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay for public government and TV fees approximately 7.2 billion per year, but they don't actually know how these institutions are holding.
How come they don't know?
The House approves, however, the report on their economy, which directly affects the positions of the Director-General of CT and CRO.
Look how those reports are discussed, on the superpowered covenant Sobotka Kalusek, which always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary committee to escape from the investigation records, and to Lex Babish.
And Saturday was so stupid that he let Kaluscom push me out of the government, which gave me the percentage of TOP 09, but the CHSSD took them away.
They are afraid of the violations of their corruption system, so they talk about the threat of Babish democracy.
No one's immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first Vice-President ANO Jaroslav Faltinek builds the power land by putting his son into the supervisor's Council, Teplaren Brno, and organizing a friendly lawyer of the Flower of Cvetoslava with urban and state firms such as the Prague Transport Business or the Czech Roads?
We have a permanent dispute in that.
I don't like it, and I've done it a few times.
The Faltinek arguments that the mentioned lawyer works significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As a finance minister, I didn't have anyone.
We've never had a corrupt affair, no Pelta, the Kratowall, the Brezine.
If there was any indication of customerism, we fired a man like that right away.
I'm unpromised in this direction.
If something like this happens, we get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it would be.
