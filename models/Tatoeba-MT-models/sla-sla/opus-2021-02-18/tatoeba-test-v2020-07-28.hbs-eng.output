She was hesitating for a moment.
Could it be done?
I live in Istanbul.
May I ask you a question?
I want us to be more than friends.
Can you explain to me?
I bought some foods.
All the things come to an end.
You just saved me a lot of time.
I wouldn't hurt them.
It was so cold that his teeth crushed.
What's your name?
Where's your dog?
This is the beginning of the new era.
He was Layle's dance partner alone.
A little bird told me.
Can I take you home?
Tom has his reasons.
Tom said he needed my help.
No doubt.
Just tell Tom I called.
We could use some help.
It was love at first.
Stop.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom's still frustrated.
I'd like to buy a dog.
Tom made it clear that he wouldn't do it.
Infrared and ultrafial asts are types of light invisible to the human eye.
This is useful information.
Sit down for a second.
I shouldn't have taken that off.
Tell me what you wrote.
"Learn from your mistakes" and "Experience is the best teacher," they say, but on long ways even the best teacher is angry if he or she has too much to teach in a little time.
Share your cards, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
There's almost no violence in that city.
They already have one.
You really don't have to do that.
Is your watch right?
I hope it'll be a dry time.
Could you take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunch next day?
At least 50 passengers died.
It wasn't my fault.
I know him well.
Are they in love?
No one knows what's going on behind that door.
I know everything.
How could I resist?
I bought a lot of things.
I'm just not very happy.
Let's see you, Tom.
There's no rule without exception.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
In our world, education is disappointing.
The first thing my mother told me was, "Are you crazy?"
I've read about a hundred books before.
Mario bought a microscope.
I've never been camping.
I'm just listening to you.
She's rarely angry.
Why do you want to hurt me so much?
Based on what we know he's innocent?
Have you washed the dishes?
When he returned from his duty to Afghanistan, Tom was chased by nightmares.
I made my decision.
My hands are cold.
Thank you so much!
The best lecture you can attend is what you don't understand.
It won't have any effect.
Don't blade.
Do you have the right one?
I need your help.
Don't you like swimming?
I'm a responsible person.
We have wine.
I wrote his number on a piece of paper.
Add more water.
How was your day?
What Tom suggests could save time to all of us.
Italy is a half island.
Beautiful!
He's pretty busy now.
We're not proud of it.
It's a Cuban cigar.
That's his car.
Of course!
Tom's cooking potatoes to make a potato salad.
Everybody else.
Sign here.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what that is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
This is my wife Edita.
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
Anyway, you're wrong.
It's hard to deny long-term love from one.
Tom likes extreme sports.
The strong commitment to the environment is not compatible with large investments in oil and gas.
I have a white horse.
Good luck!
Let's talk about this during lunch.
Where did you get that idea?
Say hello to your friends.
That company's on his legs because of bad debts.
How did I miss that?
Is breakfast included in the price?
Tom said Mary was driving the car.
Tom hates strangers.
Fuck you!
We need to respect our personal rights.
What's that thing and your right hand?
Can I call you around 2:30?
Anybody want to go to Disneyland with me?
Why is the picture of trains so interesting?
I usually don't write such songs.
It's really so simple.
That was a funny mistake.
What are you even eating?
Don't talk.
Call him whatever you want.
Don't run in front of the rudder!
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to do that, but he failed.
Jumi will be a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother is Yugoslav.
There must be a better way to do this.
That didn't matter to me.
He loves me tomorrow!
It's too loud for me here.
Tom must have tried to clean this up without soap.
The rain was so rainful that we decided to visit him the other day.
I'm glad Tom won.
There's no one like you.
I don't want to work under these conditions.
Merry Christmas!
Tell Tom you love him before it's too late.
His disobedience pissed her off.
She refused my proposal.
The trains in Serbia are very slow.
In that case, let's go.
Tom wrote a long letter to Mary, but he didn't send it to her.
Gymnastics is his strong side.
He has a good memory.
Tom was fired.
The ends of the cold thorn.
Tom's not very nice.
He found himself a hero to be a hero.
I really need Tom here.
I believe you're honest.
Come play with us.
Do you know Tom ever lied?
Mary's a Catholic, but her boyfriend is atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you are.
I'm proud of you.
I saw Marcus' house.
Tom arrived this morning.
He's pretty busy now.
Who is this man?
Here's some good news.
Refugees are welcome.
Many economists deaf about that fact.
I'm proud of my family.
Tom seemed very confused.
There was a list of available candidates.
How deep is that lake?
What age is your car?
What's your name?
You have three cats.
Tom never said anything about it.
You're too young.
Don't divorce yourself.
Tom never asked why.
I wouldn't hurt you.
We do not have such an example.
Come here.
Tom'll know.
Her passport was stolen.
I know who killed him.
Did I ask you?
You can't touch it.
I've seen a lot for now.
Turn around!
Be nice.
What should I see?
It stinks.
It took four pounds of gold to get the green winning medals.
I'll have dinner at seven.
Give me the sword.
He's not smart enough to collect numbers in his head.
Watch out for me, and I'll take care of you.
You have to trust me.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
Are you familiar with the relevant man?
Would you like to talk to Tom for me?
I bought this yesterday.
How do you say "cat" in Spanish?
We need to act now.
I'm not afraid of death, I'm dying.
Everybody says that.
Speak clearly.
I haven't seen him a long time ago.
We're here to play golf.
I haven't seen her a long time ago.
Actually, I've never met Tom.
Don't yell.
This one is unique.
I'm too old for something like this.
We'll just follow you.
Knowing yourself is very difficult.
Save energy, you'll need it later.
This was a pleasant experience.
Tom's in the garage, he's working on his bike.
You're just shot.
My income dropped by ten percent.
You'll see her.
It can be hard to visit the unknown territory.
They're ready to talk about the problem.
A buried cheese.
Okay, you don't have that.
Finally!
Tom appreciates modern art.
After a long consideration, I finally did things randomly.
It's good.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does that happen often?
They walked along the beach.
We're reducing.
Can you talk to me?
Reduce the TV.
I'm wearing my shirts on my short sleeves.
Old people often talk to themselves.
Tom was hoping to become a famous writer.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
Tom showed me the poems he wrote when he was a teenager.
Where's Avis Shatter?
Don't be a road rapist.
Tom could tell us how to do that.
I'm just leaving.
Tell him I'm innocent.
She spends three dollars a day for lunch and dinner.
See you in your dreams.
Come in here.
I'll be home tomorrow.
I think you're stupid about that.
I've seen a lot for now.
I feel bad because I lied.
They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
The attorney's mission is to prove her client's innocence.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.
Tom will remember.
Why doesn't he just tell Tom?
If there's no porn with that, the porn will be made with it.
Canada is a hockey-hockey country on the ice.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean your room?
Tom's saving so he could go abroad.
I have no intention of changing.
I want to go to Bali.
You can do it if you try it.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
All right, what about you?
This is no doubt an extremely unpleasant situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
She's jumping every morning before breakfast.
This time he's leading to town.
I'm not happy with that.
I burned my tongue.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Mary's party.
Don't talk.
We had a bad fight.
What did science ever do for us?
Stop watching TV and start learning.
Turn left.
We don't know our neighbors.
You'll find the book in the library.
The police found the money stolen.
I've never seen that before.
I arrived here a few minutes before you.
Fantastic!
I didn't do that either.
How much is the bottle of beer?
Where's Tony?
I'd like to talk to Tony.
I'll be back later.
You smell nice.
It was obvious that Tom didn't want to kiss Mary.
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
That's the table.
Flowers.
That's a shame!
His brother is a very capable doctor.
I'm sick of arguing.
I've got enough space.
What are you gonna do today?
I'm just thinking out loud.
Don't yell.
I can't stop thinking about stolen money.
That train's over.
Come see us.
A young man is often unthinkable.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not angry with anyone.
They need each other.
Let's get something to eat.
That's what you think?
Can we agree that we don't agree?
I'm trying to be careful.
It's always a problem when it's about my child.
Not yet.
She wants to study abroad one day.
Check this out.
Come quickly!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of the painful memories.
You're absolutely right.
I don't know.
I'm convinced.
Add more water!
The music is important to me.
I've been working on it day after day.
Do you have your favorite?
Please come.
Take it easy!
No one has a soul.
I was pretending I didn't know what was going on.
Where there's grass, there's no water, there's no water, there's no grass.
My friend got 95 points on the math test.
Tom didn't let anyone else in the room.
Better sweet than by force.
I have a lot to do today.
You're waiting for trouble.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
In Russian, there is no word "free."
I thought you were gonna be busy.
It's great.
Could that be true?
Quiet, Tom.
That bag is mine.
Tom left before I arrived.
Tell us a story of ghosts!
I hope Tom is safe.
We talked about it all night.
I want to live in town.
What are you gonna do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Let's get away.
That must have been hard.
Your wish is a command to me.
I'll call her tonight.
I had to make some difficult decisions.
Tom's Maria's grandfather.
Ammonia is a base.
Check it again.
Are you honest?
That made sense to me.
She was trained in the United States.
Tell me what I have to do.
Open your mouth!
Nothing's been told to me.
Fire spread to the nearby building before the firemen arrived.
Tom didn't make friends as easy as Mary.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Bad time stopped me from leaving.
Tom bought the papers.
And that's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
The black smoke was coming out of the chimney.
I know a gentleman.
You'll never catch me alive!
It's one of the biggest summer music festivals.
I was honest and honest.
It's time to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for the book.
Shut your mouth and sit down.
What's this?
He took off.
Tom's asleep again.
Don't move!
He's an American.
Tom's only talking to Mary.
No doubt.
The first lesson is easy.
You're so fast.
Tom's gonna work.
I got off the train.
We're brother and sister.
I'm pretty good at doing more things at the same time.
No one is as fast as you are.
I agreed to buy that.
She's really in a bad mood.
Am I the only one who's going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please be honest with me.
Are you sarcastic?
Let your imagination go.
All right, what about you?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove that?
You can't go into that room.
What did you do to me?
It's all here.
Why just me?
Tom and Mary were wrong about that.
I'm not as high as you are.
How many years have you been since I last saw you?
If you do it, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
You're a melem for the soul.
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I should never get involved in your foolish business.
The light just went away from itself.
Tom begged Mary to give him another chance.
Ask the cop!
We have five fingers on every hand.
We cooperated.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom's saving to buy a yacht.
Everyone except Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
What are the papers writing?
The system has completed the repair after three years of volunteering work.
I need your signature.
She called me very late last night.
I had nothing to do with them.
I'm claustrophobic.
He lives in a white house.
The new branch towards Haugesund will become the main effective travel link to Oslo and Eastern Norway for the entire Western region.
You let me down.
Good afternoon, how are you?
She got four e-mails.
I'm really happy about that.
Tom suspects Mary and I have something to do.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your age.
Tom managed to find Mary's house without difficulty.
It's not easy sport.
Bitcoin's a cryptolute.
I'm just not gonna do that.
You shouldn't have bought that.
Their right is to vote.
I hardly express words what I think.
Tell me where you are.
Are we going to see Tom again?
Turn right on the next corner.
My mother's cooking for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
The woman eats bread.
I listened to music.
Are you involved in this?
Do you know why I'm here?
I hope he won't notice my mistake.
I must have ate something bad.
We're leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Tom can't swim like he used to.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Both answers are possible.
Tom's working too much.
Avoid the addicts on the color dilutioner.
I liked that one.
He didn't hide his disappointment.
The boy has a horse.
Do you like rollers?
We're out of food.
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
It's a good time today.
Can you make Tom laugh?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
Proletters of all countries, united!
I'm very impressed.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did that.
Italy is in Europe.
How many people were there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom so much.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were kidding her.
You have the right to be happy.
I don't think anyone knows.
You have to work more.
Why are you so paranoid?
Tom was rolling around the room, not able to calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I found an empty cage.
Rest, Tom.
What does he want to do?
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come in sometime?
She wonders how it's possible.
Santa lives on the northern floor.
He was born in Ohio.
Please go.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You chose a beautiful one.
Look what she's like!
I was trying to be nice.
Mary's a wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I have difficulty talking about my feelings.
I'll give you everything you want.
It's their book.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were kidding her.
I'm not sure when Tom will be here.
You should come home.
Alice was smiling.
She can't bribe.
Will you turn off the light?
I'll save you.
I'll let you know.
We can watch Tom in a suit, behind a black large piano with dramatic finger moves, creating a very pleasant music to listen.
The strong winds broke a lot of tree branches last night.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
We need to prepare the field for negotiations.
Shouldn't you be preparing for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
They laughed for his mistake.
The way to the man's heart leads over the stomach.
Every ship needs a captain.
It's time to get up.
The house is built from a brick.
I didn't write this.
I got down on the wrong bus station.
I can't without feeling partially responsible.
People were good to me.
I know this is weird.
Tom's out of sight now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary are leaving today.
Have you ever tried?
Dr. Jackson has a good relationship with the patient.
My father lives and works in Tokyo.
Are you a student?
Can I scratch for a cigarette?
I could go with you.
Take a little.
Come in.
Burg Kalifa is currently the highest cloud in the world.
How many covers are on the bed?
You really don't have to do that.
Why are you so smart?
I'm cooking lunch.
I wonder what Tom is planning to do.
I'm fat.
You need to know how to read the notes to join the choir.
Tom's got a nightmare.
They wanted an apology.
Where was I wrong?
Our school was founded in 1990.
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you a little later.
Why me?
Obviously, I was too optimistic.
Tom's cooking for us.
We live in the house.
You're not done yet?
You're very inadequate.
He's making good money.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
The zoo is closed on Monday.
That's the point.
Knowing foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It's very natural for human beings to always give himself the advantage of the interests of others.
I'm eating here.
It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I've got a lot of things planned for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
He was pronounced captain of the football team.
Why are you still awake?
I was attending school yesterday.
Tom does what he's told.
I'm still working.
Deep, insensitive children can grow up in sociopates sometimes.
I'd like her to be with you.
The police's job is to stop and investigate crime.
Can you give me the remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
After you.
We all work too hard.
I'm Ricardo.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom's learning very fast.
You're different.
She knows the hatred of others.
This will make our job much easier.
He loves football.
What time can you come?
The monks were able to play tennis in the monasteries.
No one trusts him anymore.
Keep the kids away from the drugs.
Who's Tom, is he your new boyfriend?
I was wondering if I might dream.
Everything's changing in time.
No one's going anywhere.
The game can be delayed until next week.
I have a soul.
Drive to work from an hour and a half.
It's right.
Your time will come soon.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do that.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorce.
He's here.
I'll make up something.
It all started a year ago when he came home.
Play it again, Sam.
You're drinking coffee?
Some of us think that such views are just crazy.
It works.
Someone could be hurt.
Tom didn't write any letters to Mary while he wasn't here.
We're sick of you.
You're not gonna be able to handle this job.
We all know Tom was guilty.
She's Chinese.
I don't want a vodka.
We need to be reasonable.
I'll be in the back.
Look at these.
He needs it.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom pulled out a thicker end.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
I'm more worried about you than about the future of Japan.
I couldn't without regret it.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a mild pain.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's okay.
I've read about a hundred books before.
I'm wearing up to the skin.
Come play with us.
And it was only with great pains.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Not a lot of people know it exists.
Did you write the number?
That's not the reason for panic.
I only got 20 points on the mathematics test.
The worst headaches have been caused by insufficient ideas.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I married.
Explore this.
What's your name?
They're trying.
My future is in your hands.
It's a fake, isn't it?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
Tom's cold-blooded.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him a day earlier.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
Can you distinguish the silver from the cossiter?
Hands up!
I'm not practicing as much as I should.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think that's really important.
She's not speaking English, she speaks French.
That's so sad.
How clever!
You should know better.
Shortly, I disagree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not dating anyone, are you?
She's a teacher.
Without water, it's impossible to live.
I've been playing piano a long time ago, so I still can do a little bit.
Is this your glass, or your sisters?
The battle took a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter represented two generations.
We finally arrived!
He's in good hands.
He said he had to work in the garden two hours a day.
Apples and crushes are given, not gold and green forests.
I'm resting my legs.
Professor's excuse is almost perfect.
Do you want to learn something specific?
I really like to practice.
I love you!
I'm really proud of it.
We were in the last place.
I've contributed.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
I can read German, but I can't say that.
That doesn't really look like you.
She has achieved her goal.
I'm double older than Tom.
Insaneness has crossed the border.
Isn't that black?
This isn't a child book.
You're absolutely right.
Come, sit next to me.
We know we're better than that.
It's like I don't know that!
Let's not talk about this now.
Have fun.
Time to break up.
What kind of food do you like cooking?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
They know you.
He was the son of a rich merchant.
The meeting performance is ready.
I said I'd wait for you.
She looks good for her age.
What's this?
What are you even eating?
I don't like being convicted.
I have an appointment tonight.
Tom enjoys fishing.
A man hopes as long as he's alive.
Be careful.
Let's discuss options.
Don't worry, if you help me, everything will be fine.
I'm a miracle.
That was a funny movie.
We just saw her.
Bitcoin is a crypto.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom's gonna take care of this.
Go check it out.
Some of us hate it.
"This came for you." "Oh..." "So, do you remember the one she sent to you when you asked her to give you the pictures of the Eplexek brother?" "Yes." And then she told you to write the criticism of Mac's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent the criticism of Mac." "Yes." "Yes." "What did you tell her that you learned from that?" "I realized that Philips' s scratch is persuasive, but not deceptible; and that Rerite is awfully charged with things that I think she should do as a friend."
I always liked horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I overlook that?
I don't want to take you any more time.
I'm only going to church for respect for my mother.
It's better to live one day like a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.
"Has he explained?" "Yes."
Not all the lamps are magic.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
He killed himself.
I was very excited.
You don't have to eat right before you get to bed.
Tom's gonna wait.
What's going to happen now?
I need five more minutes.
The students didn't know how to answer.
She's ashamed of lying.
I'm not a nightbird.
Did you get the package I sent you?
I'm not a doctor.
My baby wants to talk.
It's good to see you again.
Tom bought me a VIP ticket.
I'm fat.
I'm the one who should do that.
Tom's gonna call.
He fired the torch before he entered the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a very good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom quit college.
Why do you hate me so much?
What am I doing here?
Tom will understand.
Those girls are very busy.
Give us some room.
There's the truth about what Tom's saying.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of your screaming.
Get out!
We have two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make a place.
The horse must have screwed up and the knight fell off the horse.
I didn't forget.
There are islands on the sea.
I'm investigating it right now.
Mini skirts are newly modern.
What are we actually looking for?
She's achieved her goal.
Tom can do whatever he wants, as far as I am concerned.
Tom said he needed money.
Tom was pretty good.
Hurry up!
He couldn't understand much of what they said to each other.
This medication will make your headache soft.
He disappeared without a lead.
Oh, leave me alone.
That's what both of them like.
We sat together in silence for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He never goes on a train.
He's dependent on Starbuck coffee.
The book's on the table.
Two sides will speak this week.
I plan to give my son a computer at the end of the month.
The card is stronger than the paper.
Why did you shave your beard?
Tom's not a good writer.
Fadil changed his mind.
I've never noticed that before.
It's happening.
We know who he is.
I need a cab.
I saw the cat.
I'm in a gypsy.
Mom just went shopping.
It's her, isn't it?
I'm proud of you.
I'm always nervous on passport control.
That needs help.
Defend yourself.
He caught a cab to the hospital.
This overcomes all the borders.

I miss you so much.
Do you know how to žongl?
Don't touch the lion while he's sleeping.
Tom's unliked.
Could it be alive?
Did you just meet him?
Honestly to be, I don't know.
That's your choices.
That makes sense.
It's safer.
Tell me about your teacher.
I saw the dogs.
Maybe she has other plans?
This isn't a sentence.
I'll see you next time.
The patient's breathing.
Thank you all for that.
I don't see anything suspicious.
This evidence does not leave a place of suspicion, this could not be the original Picass' work.
Am I so different?
He concentrated on it.
Whose manuscript is this?
I have to go.
That's a good feeling.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Let's have lunch here.
It's a glass window.
I'll find the money somehow.
I shot a bear.
I'm sad to leave.
This fish is big.

Tom was very happy when his team won.
They decided to get married.
What did you two do?
She's an Argentine.
I doubt Tom is at all interested in trying to learn Russian.
I'm afraid you got this wrong.
I know those girls.
What's this?
The way to the man's heart leads over his stomach.
I'm adopted.

I'm punished.

Only Tom and Mary were saved.
What's your name?
I'm done.
The man is part of nature.
I wasn't very impressed with that.
Tom wanted to see Mary's room.
I left Tom 2013.
Do you know anything about Tom?
I'm drinking coffee.
Pick one.
Mary knows that her main weapon, a beautiful face and a young body, a passive value.

I'm looking for a job.
I'd better go with Tom.
Let's try it.
I'm leaving it to you.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Tom really knows a lot.
That needs a dream.
That's what I need to tell Tom.
We're ready to go.
I don't live in that city.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
Tom's not a kid anymore.
I thought you'd be busy.
Don't move!
I'm a vegetarian.
I'm used to doing that.
I have a sharp knife.
Tom asked me if he could use my computer.
I took him to the expensive restaurant in campus.
That's very nice of you.
I've heard this joke before.
I think I missed something.
They went on a plane from Berlin to Istanbul.
Send Tom in.
Tom asked me some questions about what just happened.
I'll let you know.
I reacted instinctively.
The answer to this question is simple.
I'll make sure Tom has everything he needs.
I'm deeply embarrassed.
Mom just went to shopping.
He was naked and boss.
She's just out of my league.
What are we actually looking for?
I want to be with her.
Why are you all in shock?
Apples are red.
Why do you think so?
Schools and roads are services paid by taxes.
What does the doctor think it's wrong?
Don't push.
Looks like we're just the two of us.
They don't pay you enough.
Today things are very different.
Elementaryly, my dear Watson.

What's your friend's name?
Some religious people can be very condemning.

Where's Teheran?

She looks good for her age.
How long did Tom have it?
Mom, I'm hungry.
We're all eager to see the movie.
I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.
We can save some time if we do what Tom suggests.
If you want to talk to a lot of people, you need to learn Esperanto. Why is this language? Because it is beautiful and stimulates our learning at the same time. The international language is very important because there are so many people from different countries around the world. Besides, Esperanto is not only useful but also easy to learn. If you learn Esperanto, you can travel to many countries. Come and learn!
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
Did you get some sleep?
I'll take you to Tom.
He's watching the olympics.
Could it be Tom?
A little bird told me.

Don't argue.

I'm learning a few languages.
Forgive me, I shouldn't have said that.

Everybody laughed.
You're good to everyone.
Tom showed up to heaven.
I didn't care.
That's not true, is it?
She has twenty children.
Tom said he didn't see anything strange.
I think we'll get to Boston before dark.
You never arrived in time.
That sounds like treason to me.
I'll try not to disturb you while you're studying.
Life's short.
What was I supposed to do?
Why do you think Tom would do that?
They'll know.
I didn't have a good time last night.
You're innocent.
All the participants gathered in the main hall.
Don't exaggerate.
Hey, relax.
I'm sure you're very busy.
When Marcus came, I slept.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Tom's going to make progress.
No one can open the door.
Tom was totally scared.
Whose guitar is this?
Greece has a lot of islands.
This won't hurt at all.
We have to run away.
The thief ran away.
We can't stop Tom from doing that.
I'm not selective.
Eat everything.
That's what I'm used to doing.
Get out of here!
Tom's still at work.
Tom wasn't very good.
You think better when you close.
Anything else?
Anyway, you're wrong.
You need something more than coffee.
That's normal.
Are we all here?
He knows a lot of people.
I'm turning around.
I feel bad because I lied.
Tom was screaming from pain.
Anything or nothing.
I left my credit card in the house.
Everyone says I look like my father.
Do they love each other?
I've contributed.
I'll sign it.
Shame him.
Exactly.
We hope you like it.
Let me in.
Will the future be like scientific fantastic?
It just happened again.
How long have you been here?

The book is dry.
My mother bought two bottles of orange juice.
What would you like to know?
Live long and feel good!
We met each other in London.

I hope she'll be fine.
The wind calmed down.
I can't make him happy.
This is communism.
There are subtle differences between these two pictures.
In my bedroom, I have a mirror from the floor to the ceiling.
I wish I had remembered that.
Don't sound like that.
What can you do?
Excuse me, can you repeat that?
Get out of there.
Scientists interpret it in a different way.
When can you come?
The Festival was held in Latvia.
Life starts then, when we figure out who we are actually.
We're what we are.
Your time's up.
Some people, regardless of their age, don't lose their beauty.
Where did you get that idea?
She let me go.
You didn't answer the question.
We're in there.
Let him pay for what he did.
She also likes books.
I'll stay home tomorrow.
Nobody's coming to save you.
I don't want to do that.
Tom always bothers me.
I have a good vision.
Are you ready?
She's proud of her talent.
This box is almost empty.
You can start right now.
Are you done?
You need one of these.
Sit down.
I'm impressed with you.
I can't decide where to park.
Cool!
Failure is a spice that tastes success.
How's this your fault?

Cheers!

My bike is new.
Tom told me today that he loved me.
I doubt Tom knows that.
Can I escort you home?
I've already tried that.
Go upstairs.

I'm running early.
Tom thinks the same way.
It's saying like this:
That's how it's important.
Turn left.
No way!
How long have you stayed?
Tom's a passionate bikeman.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
He'll be there soon.

Will you join us?
What did you learn today?
We liked food, especially fish.
And they lived happy for the rest of their life.
Tom's too poor to hire a lawyer.
You're very rude.
Don't look at it.
Read this.
I walk like a penguin.
I'm interested.
What's the problem?
He's not a doctor.
Tom was accidentally made.
Marcus became a Uzurpator.
Is the handsome man Arab or Hindi?
Let's meet you for a drink.

The sun's surface temperature is about 6000°C.
He asked himself a lot of questions about Islam
If we start right now, we'll be there by 2:30.
What did you two do?
Where's Tom going to sleep?
Emily was surprised.
I'm not ready yet.
Why would Tom want that?
It's hard to figure out what really happened.
She passed her fingers through her hair.
Tom's working hard to endure his family.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Tom's downstairs.
Tom says he has four houses in five different countries.
We arrived at the hotel in Rome.
Let's see what Tom says.

You want to meet him?
That's better.
Look over there.
In the morning, we found a screwed dolphin.
I'm reading this book.
Just tell me you're okay.
Please take this little gift.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I'm not afraid of getting old.
I don't fully agree with you.
There are many possible answers to that question.
Let's eat ice cream now, before it's melted.

Have you seen anyone there?
Of course!

He got what he wanted.

What if I'm right?
I'd like to know how to paint like that.

I've had a problem dealing with this problem.
I don't know what it's not, yet or just before, it was good, but several times when I was trying to get on the site today, I couldn't do it.
Do I usually seem happy?
I went there with my will.
You better think when you close your eyes.
It's absolute truth!
They really meant that.
Have you ever been here?
I want your opinion.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
They're all here.
We're almost done.

Tom stayed for a few days.
Tom could be here.
It's good to have a daughter.
Tom's objecting all the time.
I don't know if I'll have time.
I'll do anything for you.
I didn't understand the question.
It was just a matter of time.
Don't blink.
He should be able to change.
I'm happy.

Are we safe now?
We're what we are.
He's not honest at all.
That's wonderful!
The note's not yours, it's his.
We need to act right now.

That's great!
Tom knows what he likes.
I'm disclexic.
You helped me a lot.
What was I supposed to do?
The password is Muriel.
We visited the hypodrom, visited the horses' racing.
Identify yourself.
I'm really happy about that.
One day you'll understand.
I was looking for you.
Thousands of thousands of elephants were killed every year because of their white bones.
It just has to be like that.
I'll come when I can.
Don't get divorced.
It's not all the gold that shines.
Are we all here?

That's great!
We need to focus on our virtues.
How fast!
It's my dog.
He lived in Istanbul for years, speaking Turkish very well.
Goodbye!
She never saw him.

Fortunately, I survived the accident.

We'll always remember that.
They left the problem unsolved.
I'm not surrendering!
Tom fell off the truck while he feeded the Irvasas.
Tom became a plunger even though his parents wear that they wanted.
The whole house's burned.
I think we've met before.
I've been wrong before.
Can you tell us more?
Tom knows it's over.
It's treason.
I'm not late, am I?
Let's go get Tom.
Tell me where you live.
There's a mistake in the sentence.
You don't remember anything?
Are we ready to leave?
Tom's drinking a lot.
I'm not from here.
That's quite a problem.
Tom was sitting on the grass under the coconut tree.
Everybody laughed.
I'm more creepy than I look.
I don't want you to see me naked.
Can I go?
Tom doesn't like to do that.
Excuse me, who is this woman?
Do you have a copy?
Come help me.
I barely left the house when it started raining.
Tom likes to be busy.
Okay, as always.
First of all.
Tom's just lazy.
I'm a little depressed.
Does that mean you love me?
Is Tom eating fish?
The garage was rings.
Check this out.
Mary is a married woman.
Is there any evidence?
You have to be strong!
It's never too late for learning.
I'd like to rent your cheapest car for a week.
Are you ready for more?
It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Do you love me? - He asked.
I told Tom you were in Australia.
Tom turned on a blink.
Tom always makes me laugh.
She rarely, perhaps never, goes to bed 11 hours ago.
Are they all crazy?
What are you even eating?
It's not a problem.
Everything happens for a reason.
How weird he is.
There are four people in my family.
Are your languages related?
That bag is mine.
I'm pulling the line here.
Tom's got all kinds of trouble.
Take attention to school rules.
Keep digging.
What school did you go to?
A few trees fell during the storm in our neighborhood.
Can I hear another one?
I prefer starving than stealing.

Tom had to rewrite the composition.
You want to get involved?

Get out of here.
Do you think what she said was a lie?

I was too busy.
Would you rather speak English?
Get lost.
I already ordered it.
What are you teaching?
How does that work?
Will we see Tom again?
You're different.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
That's my job, not Tom's.
Tell me what that is.
He's delayed his departure until tomorrow.
Tell him I'm innocent.
You're doing good, just relax, be yours.
I'd like to help.
It would be hard.
She's making his meals.
Where did you learn English?
Beauty lies in the eyes of the observers.
How do you feel today?
That needs a reason.
Okay, what's a secret?

I think it'll be a nice day.
I'm starving.
He lives in a white house.
Tom's drinking beer.
Tom's playing the piano very well.

You're just hit.
I'm here for you.
Have you ever heard of something like that?
I'm not rich enough.
Leanne has blue eyes.
Seniors should pay for their hats and dresses.
Do I see him?
Don't move!
Tom was guilty of everything.
I've been training for months.

What was the plan at all?
You should be here at half one at the latest.
Do you speak Chinese?

I saw a null horse in the zoo.
Aren't you from Australia?

I think about Tom sometimes.
Are you both drunk?
Please be honest with me.
It's hers, isn't it?
She's embarrassing my life.
I've never been home for a week.
Don't go out tonight.
Open the fire!
She's my professor.
It's not easy to entertain Tom.
I told Tom to wait.
He's a man of a word.
I'll see if Tom can help us.
It broke on two parts.
Please hurry.
Smoking is forbidden in every part of the restaurant.
They're digging a hole.
Muriel's 20.
Have you eaten anything?
I'm at the mail.
Did you go see Tom?
Attack!
Tom's gonna work.
Why are you acting like a child?
That's exactly what the doctor ordered.
Could you read it?
It's a window from the glass.
Are you done yet?
My knife is sharp.
Does Tom have the key?
The doctors are looking at the X-ray.
Don't talk.
Don't stop.
Are you sure this is safe?
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't know.
You'll be better in a few days.
That's what Tom would like us to do.
He tried to kill himself.
Tom said I should ask you.
Everyone knows that.
She enjoyed yesterday's party.
Just tell me the truth.
Birds sing.
Be careful: we write nationality, days in the week and tongues with great letters in English.
I like to watch you while you're working.
Birds fly.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not really upset at all.
As far as we know, Tom is guilty.
I love you.
Tom's a book mole.
I changed my mind.
The problem is, it's too expensive.
Many would love to be motivated, creative, thoughtful creatures, only if they were given that chance.
I've been thinking a lot about what you said.
Did Tom pull out a thicker end?
I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of dying.
We like him.
That's a good answer.
You sound tired.
Tom was wrong about that.
I don't need anything.
Tom's always making a mess of things.
He's running.
That's not the right thing.
Please record everything I say.
Without torture, there's no science.
I wish you could sleep.
Maybe you can't hear me.
We're barbecue.
I'm mad at you.
I thought you were married.
Somehow I'll find the money.
I assumed you were busy.
He's not a scientist, but he's our friend.
I hear Tom's interested.
We should move forward.
What are your ambitions?
I don't like eating a white bowl in the morning.
I think Tom is very smart.
Do you really want to learn another language?
Fish, please.
I think I'm fat.
I think we were lucky.
Don't talk.
Does French learn in your school?
Come get a drink with me.
If I could understand, I'd say so.
You're running.
I did my first step.
Stop screaming.
It's Saturday.
They were evacuated to the American Polish Hospital.
We'll run in the park.
How far is it from here?
You can't sit next to me.
I'm not happy about that.
Could you read it?
Will you dance with me?
We need to call Tom.
Tom's not strong enough.
We need more flour.
Tell me what he says here.
Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I'm staying.
His way of speaking is boring me.
I never thought about it that way.
I know Tom let you down.
He's always unsatisfactory.
Tom was severely hurt.
My shirt isn't dry yet.
If you need help, tell me.
I did my first step.
I'm still a little tired.
I'm sure there's a better way to do it.
First leaves at 17:30 and comes at 8:25.
That was a little weird.
The plants grow.
Does that read and write Japanese?
Tom put a ticket on his table.
I called him.
It was all just an accident.
Tom never even saw us.
Mom, I'm hungry.
I don't intend to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
It usually works.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
I locked the bike.
And now the word from our sponsor.
I'm not quite satisfied with the situation.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him as a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad to be here.
Stay calm.
I'm armed.
Tom can't stop.
Our eyes can't see infrared lights.
It's time to sleep.
Tom is very intelligent.
Can I replace this?
Tom wanted to have a more beautiful cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed with you.
Did you bring a fan?
I already ordered it.
We'll never know the reason.
How are you feeling?
Everybody tells me I'm weird.
Bitcoin and etherium are virtual currency.
Everything's very cheap.
Anything you remember can help.
Many predictions are not fulfilled.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm still wrong.
Turns out it's true.
I'm poor.
Did you get the book back to the library?
Fadil wanted to steal Dani's money.
Tom likes a good party.
I don't care what he says.
Mary knows all about the latest fashion trends.
He's a man with many talents.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
Tom was Mary's first love.
The proposal was implemented by a vote of hands up.
He often quotes Shakespeare.
Keep listening.
Tom may have to stay here for a few days.
We know her.
My father doesn't like football.
This hat is from Australia.
The accident happened on Sunday about 3:00.
I'm not talking to Tom.
Go take a look.
That doesn't affect him at all.
I thought the food was great.
Fifty families live in this small village.
Tom's an activist in his community.
I'm deaf and I'm not eating.
You look fat.
Tongue learning is not easy.
You got a headache?
You need to learn English a step by step.
That's better than it was before.
Tom and Mary are different as heaven and the earth.
Tom asked me about the opinion of who's gonna win the race.
Man has a lot of desires that he does not really want to be fulfilled and would even be wrong to assume the opposite. He wishes that they remain only wishes, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a bitter disappointment for him. One of these desires is and the desire for everlasting life. If it was fulfilled, a man would become completely sick of everlasting life, and would want death.
Water is fluid.
Does Tom really speak French?
I can't trust him.
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car alone.
She's taking care of her old mother.
Italy is far from Brazil.
Tom had the same problem.
Don't laugh.
My wife's father is my girlfriend.
I want to live in town.
Tom and I just wrote a few books together.
I think this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.
The news came.
No one really wants us.
Everyone paid for it.
Be careful.
Yogurt is made of milk and cream.
I'm alone.
All right, what about you?
Don't drink water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
It was just the beginning.
The book's been sold out.
The price of gold is changing every day.
Be nice.
Look around!
Tom married.
I could come with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
He's a scientist.
You have no permission to enter that room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is it interesting to take pictures of trains?
I hope you like it.
Welcome back.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a hooker.
We can't go back.
I'll take a shower.
What are you planning to do this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Can anything be more romantic?
Beethoven wrote nine symphony.
I'll hurry.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.
That's not our business.
Do you like costumes?
Why do you ask?
I saw Marcus' house.
At least he's honest.
It's really pretty bad.
Thank you all for that.
They wouldn't follow us.
And you, Brut?
The house in which Atturk was born in Thessalonica.
People are wrong.
Snow falls.
I thought you needed help.
Does this make sense?
I like your glasses.
He was chosen to be president.
He's got two cars.
That was three months ago.
I know your name.
Let's hear your excuse.
Dad said no.
They formed a swim team.
Tom took the package to the orphanage.
Keep digging.
Tom jumped up and down.
Tom's dog was lying.
Don't talk.
This information is confidential.
You taught us that.
No, no, no, no.
Go find something else to do.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
You're not leaving me, are you?
Don't exaggerate.
I can't approve this project.
Are you sending a message to Mary?
I'll keep your place in the first row.
Mary's pushing her kids to play football.
Are they here yet?
Don't forget to give me back my pen.
Little flowers flower at night.
I counted to 200.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
One day, you should try.
I'll stay home with my grandma and grandpa for the weekend.
What did you conclude?
I was praying for you.
No, that's all.
Come to my house.
Tom's on the edge of the nerve.
The bathroom's upstairs.
Tomorrow's Christmas.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom cheated on you.
Tom reads a lot.
It's just a few minutes away.
What do you know about me?
He wants to work in the hospital.
I'm not saying anything.
I got off the bus.
You're average students.
In childhood, many violent criminals have tortured animals without reason.
I'll live in Cambodia.
How long are you gonna be angry and yelling at us?
Please stop here.
How important does that really matter?
Shall we have an aperitive?
Tom's always complaining.
If you want, I'll teach you to play ukulele.
I'm already used to it.
It's not that bad.
Looks like she was offended by what he told her.
I like to play the music my friends wrote.
Tom admitted it.
I was there twice.
Deeds say more than a word.
Is this where Tom sits?
Enough!
It's hard to work with you.
Tom's growing up.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
I'm guilty.
Don't answer.
Bring some wine.
Things aren't always the way they seem.
Show me the photos!
It's necessary for a few old houses to crash.
What were you doing?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom sneaked into the party.
I'm so tired I can't learn.
I've never seen his face.
Tom's very careful.
When are you going?
This report has not been written well.
I want a new bike.
She stresses that this last government move has multiple meaning.
They say love is blind.
Tom arrived this morning.
It took about a year.
How did I miss that?
Tom didn't answer me.
Five brothers worked together at the farm.
It could be a trick.
The company is known by its high quality products.
Don't forget to smash yourself with a sun cream.
Tom didn't try to deny Mary's judgment.
Tell me what this is.
Thank you for accepting my request for a friend at Facebook.
His hair was covering his face almost all over.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh country in the world by size.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clean up his roof snow?
I'll pay you back.
Why is he here?
A student from Oslo who fake his graduation to enter college was sentenced to jail.
Tom knows it's over.
I wish that had occurred to me.
Tom made vegetarian chili.
I wanted to help you.
You were really good to me.
I'll finish reading this book.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I normally look happy?
It's not the problem of the essay itself, but all these destructive questions and explanations of words make me crazy!
He's here on the weekend.
I'll be back next week.
Looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
I really want to see her.
It was a lucky shot.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like that before.
I'm buying a lot of stuff in that store.
Did you get the package I sent you?
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
He started screaming.
I'll be there when I finish my homework.
Clean up a little.
Can I use your dictionary?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people love chicken.
Is Tom crazy?
I didn't do that either.
Are you ready?
Let's take a look again.
The last time I went to the beach, I burned hard.
Stand back.
The city was destroyed during the war.
Watch out here, Tom.
We fixed some damage caused by scratching stones on your car.
I became retired after fourty-five years of work in the office.
Why are you suddenly curious?
His girlfriend didn't provide support.
I just had a bath.
Do you doubt me?
Luckily, Tom didn't hurt himself seriously.
Generally, kids like sweets.
Tom's gonna cry.
We need your help.
I think we've eaten enough.
You scared us.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try your way.
Tom decided to take a day off.
How can I resist?
Gold is much harder than water.
The phone is a miraculous device.
Tom's afraid of death.
I can't fix the car alone.
One language is never enough.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
This is the address.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't think so.
My mother died the day I married.
Don't let anyone in!
What would Tom think?
We're not going into that.
It happens to everyone sooner or later.
This is my question.
Hold on, Tom.
Tom definitely pulled out a thicker end.
Follow me.
I don't care what your name is.
He's not equal to him.
It's all right with me.
Obviously, Tom's sick.
I started learning English when I was twelve, and then I was interested in languages, but not to that extent. Now I speak English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese; so, it's time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember that song.
I'm Ricardo.
I need a honest girl.
She's a starter.
Are they still here?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom so much.
Tom won't escape.
I'd go.
I don't take the bribe.
Get down!
Tom couldn't stand that.
Anything you remember can help.
You'll be better in a few days.
What language are you talking about?
It's not something to worry about.
I realize they're a thorn in the eye of those like you, but this is just a mess.
Tom's gonna work.
There's no free lunch.
And what if I'm a homosexual?
Anyway, he'll certainly come.
Please leave this place clean as you would like to find it.
We'll go through the jungle somehow.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
We can only do that.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
That's your life.
What's your name?
I understand.
We got lucky, didn't we?
It's crying for me.
I sympathize.
Stop regretting yourself.
He'll be done soon.
Learn yourself by doing it.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom's the one you want.
The police are chasing me.
Have you seen anyone there?
Anyway, you're wrong.
They won't take it.
There is no rule without exceptions.
Maybe you need a shovel.
There are all kinds of flowers in the garden.
No one said anything.
The book's on the table.
He's a real aristocrat.
I'm doing my job.
It's all quiet again.
I didn't make it.
We know.
Tom's going to graphical design school.
He lied to you.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always unsatisfactory.
The music is his passion.
You should face reality.
Light waves pass through space and different materials.
We managed to escape exactly in time.
I'm sick of it.
Tom doesn't fit here.
Cartage must be destroyed!
How much does that cost?
I want to talk to Tom about it.
We have some options.
It should work.
She hated him.
As far as I'm concerned, I'm not opposing your opinion.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I could talk to Tom.
It just happens.
Take a little.
Who knows what's going to happen tomorrow?
I'm hungry of this running.
I'm a translator.
It was hot in every sense of that word.
Spider's screwing me.
He's talking about others so he'd like to talk about you!
Tom was so confused that he didn't even know which question to ask.
Are you ready?
Find Tom.
I think it's okay.
Whatever you think?
You changed my life.
We'll get through the jungle somehow.
Reaction isn't always the best way to act.
I'm not gonna tell anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to take him to the airport.
The Committee recommends that those who complained should be compensated with a proportionate part of annual compensation.
Tom was buying time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of surreal.
In theory, it's possible, but it's practically very difficult.
I don't have time to write.
It's time to get up.
But it was almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
That's my money, too.
Anyway, it's over.
Tom's disrupted.
Remember the file names before you try to retrieve the deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom ran down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.
Only a vodka from Russia is a real Russian vodka!
I didn't get nervous about that.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
We won't let you die.
Many things go out of my hand.
Tom wants to teach his children the importance of work.
Tom was always a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Is it yours?
Tom is one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much do I get?
How many close friends do you have?
It's happening.
How long do you think Tom was preparing for an exam?
Some book that describes miracles of nature.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
There's no need to be stone in the glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
He's breathed.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
I'd get involved.
You can't touch that.
Don't be a scratch.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
Mary is a retired nurse.
I'm probably not gonna watch TV tonight.
Did Tom pull out a thicker end?
Give me all the money.
Mer was very supportive.
That's nice shoes.
The girl's seeing the boy.
We also call Robert Bob.
It's very difficult, almost impossible to find a apartment in Oslo.
My French still isn't very good.
They're teachers.
The government fell after the vote in parliament.
You're not funny.
Tom left instead of Mary.
It's not yours, it's his.
It happened right here.
He was driving a car on the street.
I don't know well Latin.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I don't speak Japanese.
He didn't understand anything.
I'm waiting for my turn.
That's not the main question.
I've been shaken by a lot of news.
The girl eats bread.
I don't speak English.
You're not the one who died.
Would you rather tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
I'm a woman.
Tom asked for help.
It's not exactly like that.
They know you.
I passed every test.
What are you gonna do today?
What's on your mind?
I'll kill you!
I was cold as a syringe.
There's no point just to wait for something to happen; you have to do something right now.
Here's the key to my apartment.
It's a area with a lot of new houses.
I can't believe all this.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
Snow was falling yesterday.
We walked through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid a backup key in his garden.
Let's pretend we're aliens.
I'm sure Tom will win.
I went out on the wrong bus station.
I wrote this song only for you.
Your house, your freedom.
Have you read the Holy Bible?
And if I were rich, I wouldn't give him the money.
Are we safe now?
Stop it!
We've been studying all afternoon.
Will you send this as a mail shipment?
What are you suggesting?
They say love is blind.
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
Sky was darker and darker.
Watch out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
The room is dark.
Come on, give me that.
Are you blaming me?
I wish I was pretty.
For some strange people, the knowledge of some language is kept secret.
I don't intend to change.
They slowly moved forward.
Why is love so heavy?
I survived.
Do you know how this machine is used?
I'm late, right?
Don't blink.
Blue stands for you.
Come visit us soon.
Have you been in an accident?
What are you and Tom doing?
Tom's worried about what could happen.
He was a honourable man.
My father doesn't like football.
I don't know if I'll have time.
I went there voluntarily.
We're all out of alcohol.
Card, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
Something was lying on the ground.
Children are flowers of our lives.
Why are we laughing?
My friend lives to God behind his feet.
Do you think Tom would like to go fishing with us next weekend?
She screamed him, but he didn't hear her.
Water is life.
What are you gonna do today?
He will probably win the championship.
After silence, what exactly expresses inexplicit is music.
Tom looks like a banker.
That's Tom.
It's not over until it's over.
Tom still looks worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary's a very shy girl.
Where's the vodka?
Tom doesn't have such a problem.
You can't hide secrets from me.
It just happened again.
There's a hard day waiting for you.
It's good.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I won't be part of it.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Justice must be fully satisfied.
Tom and Mary would be a beautiful couple.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
Don't work too much!
I'm so fat.
Let's stay in there tonight.
I thought Tom was amazing.
People don't always act rational.
I didn't even do that.
Did you pass your exams?
We'll have to walk now.
I'll release you.
I sincerely support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
How about we make a group on Facebook so we can discuss learning foreign languages?
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Did we agree?
It's not that bad.
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Stop smoking.
Tom went that way.
You owe me an apology.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom was afraid of me before.
Tom whispered something to Mary, and she smiled.
But why?
May I take a look at your card?
What's going to happen now?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
They set the library up with new books.
It's clean.
How about some chocolate cheese?
Today's your daughter's birthday.
Will anyone tell me what to do?
Apparently, it's a knocking error.
Your book is double bigger than mine.
We're both not rich as much as we want.
Tom wouldn't be pleased.
Tom has a nice garden.
The cup of coffee cleared my head.
Do I have a knife?
It's useless to be attached during a student life.
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom has disgusting hair.
I've seen enough for now.
That's what I hate.
We'll miss you so much if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's going to happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom's gonna look at it.
Tom ate a sandwich.
Here's what I think.
I want to go.
I could go with you.
Life costs are growing.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you deactivate the bomb?
I think Tom could do it.
I need five more minutes.
He's asleep like a baby.
I bet you know who told me that.
Mary used the apples that Tom gave her to make an apple butter.

Tom's a little worried.
Tom's the best student in class.
How is this your fault?
My phone number is 9876-5432.
Why don't you just tell Tom?
How did I overlook this?
This is a sentence.
Life is cute.
That's my cat.
What should I write here?
I'm deeply embarrassed.
My father bought me a book.
I'm adaptive.
Citizenship is a prerequisite for vote.
How many times have you been here?
I don't know who they are.
He's fixing electronic devices.
Sing, please.
You're losing.
I'm ready, bro.
Please kick as strong as you can.
This fish is big.
Send me some sugar, please.
It's nice to be needed.
I hope we figure this out.
We all have to resist this.
Where's the teeth pasta?
Mrs. Klein's 80s, but she's still very active.
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
Trust me.
This is my computer.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our manager came to a good idea and we made a great plan.
We know enough.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired that I can barely keep my eyes open.
The gardening is fun.
It's never too late for learning.
Bring me some sugar, please.
Come quickly!
Cover your mouth while you cough, sneeze or yave.
Where did you find the keys?
Have you ever hung a video on YouTube?
I was very interested in building a more intense academic programming plan.
Just give me the money.
She's pregnant.
Tom gave me a few books.
Don't let Tom find out.
I can't wait Monday.
Have you been here before?
Does Tom have any experience?
I don't understand.
Come here for a second.
So what did Tom see?
How much is this rain?
I'm getting on her.
Tom made his job in the kitchen.
I could kill you now.
Mary used sticks for walking that helped her with the climbs and falls in the journey.
Smoke my dick.
The compass shows north.
Don't talk.
Some religious people can be very condemning.
Whose initiative is this done?
Finish this.
Which one do you want me to take?
I like cable meals.
Where's your friend?
When do we start eating?
The Queen and the King have reunited their powers.
This lasts forever.
I don't know why my head hurts.
I guess you already know the answer to that.
Flowers have been fully introduced.
"How old are you?" "Sixteen."
I like this book at least.
Blue looks good for you.
How did you do this?
Tom wasn't as handsome as Marie said he would be.
Give me that other box.
Tom has an older brother John.
I'd take it.
People are complicated organisms.
They'll know what to do.
Why did you keep silent all the time?
He took off.
He saw Layla's reaction himself.
I have a laptop.
Can I ask you a favor?
He ran away.
It was fun to celebrate together.
I'm afraid I dislocated my right shoulder.
Stretch!
You really need to take a shower.
What is the purpose of life?
I don't want to work under those conditions.
Mayuko was avoiding a hard job.
She's got short hair.
Drive a poll.
My right hand's stuck.
I don't know much about you.
Did you do anything?
You taught us that.
You can't talk to her.
You should probably talk a little slower.
Happy mother's day!
I need a beer.
You're not funny.
Everyone appreciates Henry.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Sit down, please.
Does that happen often?
A bird told me.
I couldn't see who it was.
I feel safe with you.
Crazy!
You're paying me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You need to talk to me.
The chairman opened the session.
It just wasn't our day.
It's raining.
Take everything.
I wish God existed.
I resigned.
Everything's wrong.
It's all ruined.
The marriage between the same half is now legal in 20 countries, including Ireland since yesterday.
Take this home with you.

We'll try in your way.
Get yourself out of here.
You deserve to congratulate you.
I miss you so much.
Since the message was in French, I read it easily.
This may hurt a little bit.
They can speak a little Spanish.
Finish this.
Tom tried to answer Mary to that.
Can you give me some water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where were you in Japan?
Everyone's gone.
I'll learn more hard.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
Is the world unfair?
None of us saw Tom do that.
Do you love your mother?
I'm Tom's grandfather.
And you wonder why we can't stand your company?
The more I know people, the more I admire dogs.
You wrote my name wrong.
You're different.
Tom can't stay.
Shame her.
I have two cats.
It was about a thousand people.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
His girlfriend didn't provide support.
I had dinner with him.
I didn't care about that.
Some of them were and are still in constant danger because of political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I still don't think the Internet is a place for children.
That was hard for me.
The teacher gave me the longest chapter.
What did you conclude?
You're made for me.
He needs it.
Apparently it's a typefiller.
Are we done?
Do I see him?
I'm surprised you didn't know that Tom broke into Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a tiny guy.
Control yourselves.
I've been tired a lot, but I'm fine.
The butter is made of milk.
Tell her.
I'd take it.
You're my luck.
I'm waiting for the bus.
There'll be bad things going to happen.
You're wrong.
A few trees fell during the storm in our surroundings.
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere before.
Everybody smiles.
I didn't know you were so rich.
We listened carefully to not miss a word.
Do you have any problems understanding what women or little children say to you?
Looks like Cathy loves music.
He refused to comment.
Imagine yourself in my place.
Can you prove that?
We're trying.
I'm quitting.
You disappointed me.
Tom looked mad.
Don't exaggerate.
Oh, yeah, I'll have a job tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
Excuse me.
I haven't been home all day yesterday.
I'd be grateful if you stayed by tomorrow.
I'm sure they need you.
He's everything, just not fair.
The bullet broke the helmet.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.
I think I'm doing very good writing.
Tom's no longer a member of this club.
Show me the pictures!
That's a lot of help.
I filled the glass.
I'm not selective.
How many aunts and uncles do you have?
That morning, Mary visited the entire village.
The rumor has spread quickly.
Am I so different?
Tom pulled out the keys and opened the door.
Heather trusts me.
I just arrived.
I played with Tony yesterday.
What Tom did helped a lot.
I know him well.
There's no tools.
I've never noticed that before.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Mr. Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not worried at all.
It's helping.
Dima slept with 25 men during one night and then he killed them.
I'm not doing that again.
I didn't think you could do that.
We'll just follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we arriving soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I'm sure you two will agree.
I hope I'm not the only one who'll be there.
Are you mad about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This makes me very uncomfortable.
We're from Russia.
The expenses will rise soon.
I work at language school.
Did I really be so happy?
Tom might be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar to me.
It's always been like that.
I'll go to the sea tomorrow if it's nice.
Deaf people can talk in the sign language.
Jane's lying sick in bed.

What do you have to do?
The cows give milk.
Tom likes to drive.
I was looking for you.
I'm a woman.
Everything matters.

Get on board.
Good luck with work!
It's really surprising.
Have you ever seen UFO?
You're standing in my way.
It's become dark.
What's a big secret?
The police are chasing me.
I made my first step.
Elbrus is the highest mountain of Europe.
I hope Tom will remember this.
We ask the teacher questions every day.
What kind of food do you usually cook?
I'm not free today.
If the world hadn't been able to do what it is now, I could trust anyone.

We live on the sixth floor.
I'm not afraid of you at all.
Every time I see you, my heart tells me I'm in love.
Are you all right, people?
Will you help me?
It didn't get so much worse.
And they lived happy for the rest of their life.
Tom's red.
Tom took his chairs to the next room.
I'm destroyed.
I respect such people.
Did you see it work?
Is that yes or not?
I'll marry a beautiful Estonia.
My car's in the garage.
Give me another example.
Who sent me a telegram?
His condition has been fixed.
Don't laugh.
I'm not a bad student.
He doesn't know where he should be.
I'm in a hurry.
We're done for today.
He's a complete monarch.
Since the consequences are potentially serious, there is a general precaution to avoid infections in this type of patient.
I'm a free man.
I don't like screwed people.
I'm not gonna say anything.
The room was dark.
He's going home.
That could be a weapon.
Put the book on the top shelf.
He's asleep.
I can't fix the car alone.
I'd better go with Tom.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
Shouldn't you be preparing for school?
I want to feel important.
A second later, his lips screwed into a vicious smile.
My mother was an alcoholic.
Mary's enthusiasm for the course fell down when her favorite lecturer moved.
I don't want to be rude.
Mary was not worthy of your trust.
I guess you already know the answer.

When do you usually get up?
Help me.

Smoking here is not allowed.
Simplicity is the summit of credibility.
What's he alive from?
I assumed you were busy.
Did you get the package I sent you?
Call Tom.
Tom's always very nice.
I barely closed my eye.
What would I do without you?
Was Tom here when we arrived?
Was I really so happy?
I took off my wig.
I don't have anyone but her.
You're unreasonable.
Tom won't be happy to hear that.
Tom was named by his father.
That's new.
Did he really commit suicide with that?
I'm going to get some sleep.
What was I supposed to do?
Stay away from my wife.
They'll know what to do.
Do you have a copy?
I wasn't really a friend, I was just pretending.
Did I drop that?
Please sit down.
I just want to get out of here.
Tom's going on my nerves.
Why do you think that?
I'm death.
Little kids like to touch everything.
She screwed her hair to the papillots.
He was released from military service.
My right blood is bleeding.
I'm motivated.
Knowledge frees us and makes us better people.
I didn't mean to drag you in.
Are we safe now?
Which one of your friends will come?
Can you explain them to me?
I've seen Tom play many times.
They're working together.
You tried.
The toy store is closed.
I'm taking you to dance.
I'm a student.
This is my e-mail address.
Tom may try to convince Mary to do that.
She's making elephant mosquito.
You told me not to lie.
He used to be a member of the social elite than a representative of wide mass.
I'm scared.
You tried.
His opinion is reasonable.
Help us reach our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a rich man.
Can you read that sign in front of us?
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't hurry.
Give me the pen.
Your answer is incorrect.
Just tell Tom I called.
There's no answer to the question what's best, because it's always individual and depends on the situation.
Tom thought Mary was cute.
Be careful.
I'll probably never use this again.
I don't have a ticket.
Bye!
He's an American.
You look like a very smart person.
It's incredible.
I have the same desire to go abroad for a year to perfection.
There's a cup of tea and an egg on the table.
The house burned up to the ground before the firefighters arrived.
You should have told Tom that.
The most rain months are May, June, July and August.
Do I normally seem happy?
Tom lives in Paris.
I've already written a part of the report.
You're a man.
I was ready for that.
Show me the documents.
It's about...
It could be hard about passion, maybe it's just sex.
Are you done washing the courts?
I pulled the bullshit out.
I'm the only one who can do it here.
Tom's gonna pay.
Tom lost his job.
The money season's over.
I love cable kitchen.
I'll start with a beer.
Thank God.
Did Tom give you that?
She spends holidays with her uncle.
That gives me an idea.
Is Tom around?
Ladies have a privilege.
I'm motivated.
What's your name?
What a tragedy!
We're here.
It's mine, not hiss.
Knowledge makes us free and better people.
Don't talk.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
I'm almost never home during the day.
I live in Chile.
The best parents of all are those who let their children follow their inherent talents.
I would've gone.

I'll see you later!
The wind blows like a fool.
Without you, I feel lost.
I have to plan everything.
I'm going to the car to town, so I can drop you on the road.
This may not be enough.
The party is at Tom's house tonight.
You got that nicely.
Why do you need so many shoes?
Everything you have will have you one day.
Whatever Tom is busy, he never forgets our e-mail to his shirt at least once a week.
Maybe they'll need some money.
The dog is dead.
This is life.
The situation is urgent.
They argued.
Whoever wounds early, two lucky grabs.
Do we have any of that?
Is this your suitcase?
These are Spanish villages for me.
This town is not big enough for the two of us.
Tom stopped for a second.
Because of the bad time, the plane's late.
Explore them.
I'm in a better shape than you.
I'm not so worried.
Come on, get up, Tom.
Better a sparrow in his hand than a pigeon on the branch.
Do you have time to lunch with me?
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
I think it's possible to do that.
Tom thinks I don't know what he said.
I'm going to get some rest in about an hour.
I'm pretty happy now.
It's as warm as yesterday.
He first made a preliminary test with a new electronic alcohol test before he was sent to the lab test.
We walked in the park.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Look around.
Come to my house.
It was a stressful day.
Her name is Lucifera.
Don't move!
Is it clear?
Are these your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom was looking closely.
Let us help you.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
What's your job?
Let's continue the debate.
How much do I get?
Who's wearing pants in the family?
What the fuck?
Tom's on a secret mission.
I want to be with you.
The unbelievers laughed at Bishop's interpretation.
This was delicate and depicted in the personality of so strange, cruel and stubborn that little of who dared to cooperate closely with him.
She's pregnant.
The imagination is more important than knowledge.
Don't move!
Hurry up.
I could get there by 2:30.
Have fun while you can.
Merauke is the most eastern city of Indonesia.
Tom used to come here as a student.
We'll take the next one.
He keeps his youth running.
If you act like a fool, you'll be treated like that.
Did you do your homework?
Check everyone.
Tell us a story about ghosts.
I couldn't have regret it.
Check everyone.
I was sick and I had to stay in the house.
The session's over.
I burned bread.
I have a lot planned for tomorrow.
We need to follow Tom.
Why are you acting like a child?
Tom saved $300.
How does she look?
What's the Wi-Fi code?
I'm pathetic.
I can't wait till Monday.
Come with us.
Tom's on his way here.
Tom wasn't fat.
That's crystal clear.
I'm trapped.
He's a Chinese man.
Cut cheese on thin pieces or small cubes.
Stop worrying.
We'll have to wait and see.
Have you ever experienced a car accident?
I'd like to start.
I wasn't wearing intrusive clothes.
I'm fascinated.
I'm hungry like a wolf.
Just serious questions, please.
Man, that sentence has caused a real confusion.
Give food to the homeless.
I've translated the song as much as I could.
He walked out a few minutes ago.
I believe you're honest.
I don't know why I'm paying more attention at all.
The university was founded by his father 20 years ago.
Tom wanted a bigger house than his neighbor.
Tom's got an eye infection.
I'm glad we were there.
Although I was sick, I did my best.

It'll take all eternity.
The situation was extremely dangerous; it was a matter of life and death.
I've never noticed that before.
I have to sleep.
Tom usually comes to school before any other student in the department.
I'm touched.
And if I were rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Tom will help anyone who asks for help.
Why?
"Where should I sit?" "Whereever."
Wiseness is needed to understand: music does not exist for a deaf audience.
You didn't answer the question.
I don't want to play this game.
I knew you wouldn't be able to do that.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
The troubled children are often without any guilt.
I feel bad because I lied.
I invited him.
Maybe they gave up.
That's why I liked Tom.
Tom got red.
Tell him.
How do you get rid of the mole in the garden?
I love Korean food.
I have confidence in you.
It's Saturn.
Stop screwing up.
My aunt gave me flowers.
I can't sit down.
I hope that's not true.
Don't stop.
We're learning to read and write at school.

Tateba: Where the attention is to the details of the world, and the punishment is fast.
Of course, Tom loves his children.
How was your day?
Tom's a former prisoner.
Where are you now?
It's very likely that FIFA was rotten to the heart.
She gave me a contradictorous answer.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
He's wearing a golden chain around his neck.
I'm very proud of it.
Atturk was born in 1881, in Thessalonica.
At least Tom's honest.
We've been very worried about you.
The kids were looking for attention.
It's hers, isn't it?
I want to answer the last question first.
Did you tell Tom this?
We don't know our neighbors.
It's only five in the morning, and there's already a light outside.
I hate math.
What's your aunt doing?
If there's a cross-border, it'll happen sometimes.
Tom's ruling francs well.
I couldn't help Tom do that.
It's a sea!
Tom's screwed up.
I know this is weird.
Please continue.
He never overcome his son's death.
When are you leaving?
I'm just doing my duty.
Tom's fucking gone.
Everyone's sitting down.
If you don't have anything else to do, then the number of the Greek islands.
She's always wearing wooden clothes.
Good always wins evil.
Is that almost going to solve the matter?
I don't care what he says.
Mary put the ring on her finger.
We've already decided not to do that.
I'm really proud of Tom.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Tom seemed older and mature than the other boys.
He's an American.
It'll take forever.
The top of that mountain is flat.
She smiled.
The gifts of Višnua are called Vishnuans; the gifts of Shiva are the Shivans.
Tom would like to know if you'd like to come to this party.
You're grown up.
I totally lost my thoughts.
Two bags of cement will be enough.
I've never repented for doing that.
I'm convinced.
Do you speak Roma?
Tom came to see me yesterday at noon.
Hello, buddy!
Tom's still at work.
Did you sleep enough last night?
This must be a place.
If you don't be a good girl, you won't get a birthday present.
They must have known all the time.
"I think the ending is ugly," he said. "Well, somewhere in things that people make I want to see scars, failure, mess, distortion."
Get everything.
Are these your bags?
I refused Tom.
I'm not 100% sure.
I'll probably never use this again.
That kid continued to cry for hours.
I'd buy that one.
This overcomes all the borders.
I've got a headache today.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
I want to go.
Apparently, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
French is his mother's language.
Her words pissed him off.
I was laughing.
It wasn't too hot.
I'm totally out of money.
I almost forgot my passport.
I was looking for you.
Tom reads a lot.
Enough!
I hope you're not talking about me.
Who's swording, from the sword and the death.
You're good to everyone.
I'm usually not this busy Monday.
Both of my sisters are teachers.
Looks like it's working.
I don't live to eat, I eat to live.
Tom seemed very confused.
I'll be home tomorrow.
The teacher explained the meaning of the word.
I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
They've done an unexpected job.
He went over with a drink again.
Just tell Tom I called.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "if not Q, then not P."
My wedding must be perfect.
Move.
She doesn't like to tell her what to do.
We should learn.
When on the verge they have grapes!
We don't have a choice.
When this is time, it's best to sit home and not go out.
Man's character is his destiny.
I think Tom's hiding something.
Play it again, Sam.
Tom made Mary do it.
Tom, I need your help.
I brought you some coffee.
During the observation power experiment, Tom couldn't describe any pictures from the wall of his living room, even though he lived there for two years.
I've never seen Tom this busy.
Looks like you're not all yours lately.
She's pretty good.
I was definitely lucky.
I hope that's true.
I wonder whose sentence is this.
Tom was buying time.
Everybody kept their breath.
Read this.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember the name.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
That's not funny at all.
I called him.
How many calories does that sandwich have?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
What'd you like most on the road?
I like watching you work.
Tom suggested that Mary go to the doctor.
I hope we'll visit Beijing, too.
I'm going to get some refreshment.
You're my inspiration.
This time I abstained from commenting on my loved friend.
I agree.
Some Mr. Itoh wants to see you.
Be careful.
She'll pay at least $50.
Did anyone call me?
We'll have lunch together at half one.
What's her name?
I'm still a little tired.
I think I'm gonna shit.
I'm a vegetarian.
The picture is in this book.
To seek to maximize his own interest, happiness or security seem very natural for one human being.
I can do it like a joke.
I'm not singing.
It's weird that no one knows the victim.
We're out of here for five minutes.
I have a few gifts.
Sorry I'm late.
Translation is not as easy as many people think.
Tom would never admit that.
It was just the beginning.
Did you finish your homework?
During the last few days, I've been doing research on making money through the project, but I think all options will require a sudden change in my way of life, which is an uncomfortable thing.
Is everything okay between us?
I've never been camping.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the years on the tree that we broke and discovered it was thirty years old.
See you later, Tom.
Would you like fruit juice?
Let's schedule a meeting.
I pissed him off.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
Tom still seems shaken.
I'm a very sad man.
Boston is a great city.
We hope people like it.
Maybe they're leaving tomorrow.
Come here, I want to show you something.
I'm remodeling.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
That's interesting.
They're afraid of me.
I was happy yesterday.
You're my sun.
I really liked Tom, too.
He loves rituals.
No one helped us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you been living here?
She divorced her husband.
I'm here.
I want to live in Brazil.
Get help.
I didn't ask you to do that.
Tom writes a letter to his shirt every week.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
Mary's Tom's daughter's unit.
He still has no experience in this job.
Can you help us?
Will you cool up?
Tom encouraged Mary to write about his experiences.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
I changed my mind.
Based on the data I've given you, what kind of story would you come out with?
Who can't be proud of being Serbia, with their historical highest achievements - the slaughter of heads and genocides?
That makes him simplicit.
Do you know how to deactivate the bomb?
Will you invite her to the party?
Where did I leave the keys?
I'm a big football fan.
She came alone.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your own brother.
Tom lost his feeling.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
He's not missing anything.
Tom's gonna look at it.
I'm wondering if anyone could help me, but I have a cell phone that just shows a bug message.
I'm surprised.
Everyone was smiling.
I miss him.
You should spend more time out there and less inside.
Tom played the strongest ticket.
He left his family and moved to Tahiti.
I played a golf with Tom a lot of times.
You underestimate me.
What's your favorite youtube-seen?
Millie's listening to music.
The sea is green.
I don't have a guitar.
Will you report me?
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Tom said we should stay here.
We're close friends.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
We just started.
My friend can speak liquidly to Hindi.
Yeah, isn't it great?
Please, get away.
I like Tom, but he doesn't like me.
Where can I find a tourist office?
I'm comfortable.
I've already written a part of the report.
I just finished it.
We're talking about a wolf, but a wolf on the door.
Don't stop.
Please come see me tomorrow.
I have the impression that he knows a secret.
It was a little weird.
Tom won't take the exam.
Will you do that to me?
I really enjoyed it.
No one died... yet.
At my beginning, it's my end.
Can we, people, cook grass and extract food ingredients from it?
Why don't you play with the others?
How would you translate that?
It's almost half three.
We have three dogs, one white and two black.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom wrote a stick on the ground.
Don't you want another glass of milk?
Enjoy yourself!
Who is she?
I bought this yesterday.
The chances are against me.
I'll quit.
Kids play outside.
You're all right.
Do what you want, I don't care.
He expects us to help her.
Who are you?
Call me any time, I always have a shoulder to cry.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you understood me wrong.
That's good.
I'm not gonna get you up.
Tell me what's going to happen.
Tom saw enough.
Thank you for coming!
What's your blood group?
Are we leaving soon?
I found his book.
They're selling sugar in the store.
Tom and Mary were watching sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does it sometimes.
Do you have any news for me?
I'm thirsty.
It's our duty to help them.
He didn't do it on purpose.
Thank Tom for your help.
Simplicity is the highest level of credibility.
What did you both do?
Happy birthday!
Time remains bad.
Photos of nature and animals, painted in complete silence and calmness, are real master work.
My mother died the day I married.
You want to meet her?
I'll never mention this again.
We're out of food.
You don't have permission to go into that room.
You're the boss.
We have two children.
I think Tom's careful.
Oh, no!
I forgot the baby's surveillance device.
Tom's upstairs.
He's kind.
Just relax.
Smoking is forbidden in every part of the restaurant.
You don't have to come to the office, take your day off.
The white family will come to Tokyo at half eleven.
What did you do to me?
Enjoy it.
Let me write your steps.
Tom's probably still hiding.
This is the beginning of the new era.
Mary looks cute, whatever she wears.
Shit happens.
Watch out!
Tom failed to provide any evidence to support his statement.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You don't even know his name, do you?
We don't need to look from high to the poor.
You have a bad nature.
Is this your phone?
I'm on my way.
They divorced after the anniversary of the marriage.
This house was built by a famous architect.
He was worried about the child.
I bought this yesterday.
I had a lot of bad day.
The whole country's talking about it!
I'm not a good swimmer.
Does he love me?
Tom made a omelet.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm disgusting.
I was happy yesterday.
The way Mary slammed the door, Tom realized she was sad.
Marriages and wives should help each other as long as they live.
All we need is water.
I wonder if Tom likes dancing as much as Mary.
What would you like to know?
It's not the best time now.
He's not a kid anymore.
I'm trying to get a futon at least twice a week.
My education has made me what I am.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Wherever I go, I'm there.
You want to join me?
Leave the book on the upper shelf.
You stole my idea.
We could be happy here.
He's very educated.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
He's screwed up again.
Is that what it takes?
Take everything.
You tried.
Our yacht club has ten members.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
Mom, that aunt and man hold for their hands, they're very good friends, aren't they?
Can I send you home?
I just saw Ambassador Saudi Arabia resigned.
Be careful.
Maybe something's wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open that.
I've had a problem dealing with this problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
I have one brother.
You're the most boring person I know.
Contact Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you such information.
I didn't do it.
I have a few friends.
I have to look for her.
I can't wait.
I'll check it out.
Tom was shocked.
Just a second, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom wants to know when you'll be done.
Call me.
Tom still looks shaken.
That's what the doctor ordered.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "(no P) and/or Q."
He speaks English.
I'm writing a message to Tom right now.
That's an exception.
Tom came here a little sooner than usual today.
Do you believe in eternal life?
I could eat a horse.
Actually, I never met Tom.
What's easier?
Tom asked for an increase.
Fadil wasn't in the house.
I've never noticed that before.
This should work.
Where have you been all afternoon?
What do you have to do?
I always liked Tom more.
Where was Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought the papers and read them on the train on his way to work.
I have house ghosts.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cookie for Tom.
You're funny.
Are Tom and Mary really married?
The horses sleep standing.
Let me try another one.
You're working slowly.
I didn't do that either.
The Stories of Snory Sturluson are talking about the spread of Christianity in Norway by violence.
Answer me now.
Feel like home!
Students didn't know how to answer.
Did you know that before?
I'll try and convince Tom to do that.
Am I so different?
I screwed up.
I assumed you were busy.
From when are you running?
That elegant golden chain with the hearts is a necklace that's gonna shake your world.
Your answer is correct.
I love Leanne.
Everything happened with lightning speed.
Do we have to tell Tom?
It's been raining.
There's milk in the fridge.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
You can sit next to me.
Take more.
You're irrational.
I'm mad.
Don't argue with me.
The holiday dinner was held in the White House.
Planning should be left to me.
You can avoid a lot of trouble if you just do the right thing from the first time.
Marie jumped out of the window into the river.
She was crying.
The doctor's on his way.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
He invited her to a date.
We all have to die.
Who are we?
Does Tom really speak French?
A bill, please.
The broccolate is one of the healthiest kinds of vegetables.
I'm scared.
I'm great.
Can you enjoy this book?
Serbia's capital is Belgrade.
Did you expect something else to happen?
John and Mary always walk by holding hands.
Don't worry, I'll translate it for you.
Where was I wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I missed so many opportunities.
We heard she was crying.
It helped me a lot.
You don't have to yell.
Give me another case.
Tom still has a little time.
We don't have a choice.
It's a boring baseball.
Tom was more than generous.
She's violent right now, she needs to be avoided.
I just screwed it up.
I'm sure it wasn't deliberate.
Tell him I'm innocent.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
I'll visit him in a few weeks.
Italy is not Greece.
It's for my friend.
They don't speak English.
We lost ourselves, didn't we?
We won't let you die.
Did you go see Tom?
What's that?
He surrendered.
I can't wait forever.
This is the beginning of a new era.
America is a big, friendly dog in a small room, every time he waves his tail, breaks a chair.
I don't have a ticket.
The doctor's working in the hospital.
Nothing happened.
I baked an apple pie.
He has a good reputation.
You'll be famous.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Welcome to Tatebe.
Everything's different.
What's your Bosnian name?
The truth has to be said.
Look at how much it is!
We need to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage, he's working on his engine.
Is your car blue?
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted to have a bigger ship than his brother.
Tell me what that is.
Let's hope Tom is smart.
He lied to you.
How many mosques are there in Istanbul?
He was late for the accident.
For breakfast, I always eat fruits and owls.
Do you think I'm a dictator?
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom made it clear that he doesn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.
We suggest that water quality be checked once a year in pipes, twice in the well.
Dear God, it's really hard for people when they have to turn your attention to one or the other thing about you, your attitudes or your appearance, for example.
Don't be late.
What did you say?
Tom could have done better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I've been thrown into a big shit.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of the dogs that lay.
Are they still there?
Tom hasn't written Mary for a long time.
This story tells us some interesting facts.
"Yes, orange juice, please," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.
Can I interrupt you for a moment?
I hate science.
Students didn't know how to answer.
Do you have a book?
He's got two cars.
If you don't mind them, they won't bother you either.
It's a good intention.
I've been thinking about it before.
Men stay children all their life.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
Come on, admit it.
We're so different.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
Girls were sleeping.
I'm just looking around.
Where's the beach?
Do you want to know something specific?
Welcome.
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
I'm tired.
You don't have to tell me twice.
Interability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I have no idea.
Tom was seriously hurt in an accident.
Two-thirds of the students were on a meeting.
My mother's not like other mothers.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
That can't be true.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You're opening the door.
That's good.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you're not talking about me.
Don't give me that gun.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Did you see my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look again.
Do you speak French?
I'm objective.
Nine of the ten voters believe Mary is the most suitable candidate for a new leader, but Tom won't vote at these elections.
I bought flowers.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
She came back from the hospital.
I'm probably not gonna read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
He asked me to help him.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
What's going to be now?
I brought a cup of coffee.
Make a place.
Tom is very famous in Australia.
Someone called.
Be careful.
Winter is snowtime.
What's the name?
What are you gonna do with Tom?
Good morning, how are you?
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful with your wishes.
Tom's a third-year student.
Who's going with us?
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
Who are you really?
How it came, that's how it went.
Give him time.
Who's waiting, hey.
I'll have to say, yes.
We were never separated.
I'm 30.
Give me my bottle back.
I'm really happy to be here.
What the hell is wrong with you?
The doctor thoroughly examined them.
At that point, it exploded with a big blast.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91 percent of the Norwegian population are free from drinking water from surface sources.
It's his, isn't it?
What's she drinking?
It's artificial tears.
Tom's very rude.
Don't forget to write the date.
She doesn't speak English.
Clear this mess.
Could you read that?
Try it again.
That's perfectly normal.
How's your life going?
They say there was a new restaurant built.
The price of this book is five dollars.
I want a sword like this.
Can you keep secrets?
Tell her.
I assumed you were busy.
Move quietly.
When the fire exploded, he slept greatly.
My older sister is well singing.
I never thought about it.
A childhood disease blinded her.
Some friends can't be replaced.
Although the existence of this phenomenon is a speculation, there will be evidence that will support it in the future.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Tom explained the details, but I still don't understand.
I'm from Croatia.
I want to eat some cheese.
That wouldn't like it.
I'll have to change my habits.
I met your father yesterday.
I'm really curious.
Are you a man or a woman?
Tom parked twice.
Do you know Latin?
Will you help me?
Good morning, how are you?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
Come back.
What are you gonna do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Everyone has the right to protect moral and material interests that come from any scientific, literary or artistic work that he is the creator.
Tom signed the account.
There are islands on the sea.
I've never had trouble sleeping.
Tom's hiding under the table.
I didn't see anything.
How many books can I take at once?
She went out for a walk.
Any other options?
The amount for the work done and the interest in the investment capital was a few million.
Champagne, please.
I can't wait to see you tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what's going to happen tomorrow.
I'm the one who pays.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need a drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't fully agree with you.
It's a nice day today.
Do you keep this place for someone?
How are you these days?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I really think that we women have an extra sense.
Week has seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about it.
Will you come to Tom's and Mary's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
Croatia is a country in the southeastern part of Europe.
I'll be back late.
You're a little liar.
The sea's up, the sea of people.
I'll send a letter to my brother who lives in Sapora.
The politician had sticky fingers because 5% of each contract ended up in his pocket.
I'll stay with the baby if you want to go.
I don't read novels.
I thought that was my job.
I'm a professor.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
There's no reason to panic.
He didn't even hear Tom hates us.
I don't want any beans.
Where do you live?
It's been a long time since I sent a letter to anyone.
What's the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom turned off the engine.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't argue.
Did you write the report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he had no choice.
Can you leave, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
American English is not better than British English.
Tom works about nine hours persistently.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
It's fair.
Not everyone could hear what Tom said.
Why would I want to kill you all?
Tom decided to sell the car.
I'll take a shower.
I'm happy.
It's mine, it's not his.
We have four hours of French every week.
Let's start now.
I can't think about it while I'm doing it.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
Fadil demanded Denmark's money.
It's our only hope.
I got on my left foot today.
He broke into my home.
The bathroom's upstairs.
She took care of her son.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It's a typical gotic church.
It was a presentation to the audience.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do that.
Is this your notebook?
We kind of survived.
Tom wasn't practicing.
Thank you so much!
Keep the remnant.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should do a test again.
Why would Tom surrender?
Europeans have gained advantage over other civilizations 500 years ago.
It seemed to me that Tom didn't do what he was supposed to do.
I'll pray for your family.
Tom chased the flies out.
He suddenly stopped smoking.
I can't remember what I was eating yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even the kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
Tom asked Mary to deny the word.
I have a cat and a dog.
Sarajevo is Bosnia and Herzegovina's capital.
The cup is on the table.
That makes me very angry.
Is there still light outside?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the branch.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
Don't thank me.
I assumed you were busy.
Do you agree?
Would you like me to look at your house?
You have to control yourself.
What's the difference?
I recognized him at first sight.
The French are our friends.
That's very nice of you.
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to trust me.
If I love you, what's your business?
I wish that had occurred to me.
I'm drinking milk.
Tom managed to get in the house through the window.
I saw the cat.
She doesn't speak English.
I saw the cat.
In Paris, snow falls.
I hope Tom will return safely.
I have no idea what was going on in his head so he would refuse such a favourable proposal.
I just got up.
How's it feeling?
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean up now.
You tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go out and walk.
Don't leave me alone.
Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom's strict but fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us were eating potato salad.
Come alone.
To be a good kid, you need to go to bed and get up early.
All right, what about you?
I mean to go abroad.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where are you from?
I promised.
My family goes to Italy every year.
It's not a simple sport.
Their friendship has quickly turned into love.
Don't be a lesilebovic.
This is how it was supposed to be.
I eat a lot of meat.
I don't like to work.
Tom's a scumbag.
The future seems dark for Edmond Dantes, since he became the victim of the conspiracy, he was convicted to betray and sent to prison for life.
You're irrational.
My French is bullshit.
We survived somehow.
She covered her disappointment with a smile.
My mother chose this curtain.
We're both not rich as much as we want.
It hits.
Can you let Tom know I came in?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
I'll give you the money tomorrow.
You need one of these.
Is he a teacher?
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French myself.
I like walking.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I asked Tom to wake me up at 2:30.
Tom's thinking the same way.
That's his weak spot.
You're one of us.
Faith can move the mountains.
She's in the grave with one leg
Tom just told me the opposite.
Against the loudest!
He was two years younger than I was.
I'm compassionate.
Tom's dissatisfied.
That would be a pleasure.
He's crazy like electricity.
I'm sorry I didn't answer your letter before.
Don't drink water from the dirty glass!
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote.
That doesn't scare me at least.
We didn't play well.
How old are you really?
Someone's here.
Tom asked me if I slept at all last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
Here's her picture.
How can I forget those days?
I'm thirsty.
A friend of mine studies abroad.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Who's your favorite wrestler?
Nice to meet you.
I didn't want to hurt you.
This place looks a lot different than what it was before.
Is it yours?
Why are the rabbit's ears big?
I'm a runner.
I don't sing.
The souls don't exist.
I want to help.
I know how to do that.
I shot a bear.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's really an idiot.
Yeah.
Come see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
I love this song.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to deal with in the walk.
You're working too much.
This one's really cool.
Not a word to anyone.
I just enjoyed it.
That can be trusted somehow.
You're a teacher.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Cade.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That's a lot of help.
What do you believe?
I'm sorry, I'm late for the session.
What we need is a responsible government, what we have is a circus.
I'm sorry I tried at all.
That river looks tiny, isn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this composition.
It's five hours in Brazil in the morning.
Tom pointed out Mary's going to do it.
Is this your phone?
We hate Tom.
This one's really cool.
Tom cut the tape.
Do you think the situation will improve?
Who is she?
Tom was arrested three times.
This isn't that fun.
That's a big secret.
Mary said she'd find out all her bosses' secrets if they didn't increase her salary.
It's not learning at school.
Is it clear?
I don't want to get out tonight.
"Would you think?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Fish can't live out of water.
I have a book.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
Stop resisting!
I'm cold.
I'm so busy that I can't help you.
I have two colors.
Move!
Please wait a minute.
I'm not gonna do that!
I'm tired of arguing.
Are you a maniac?
How was your day?
What am I doing here?
They're good people.
She's a singer.
I like to watch you play.
That's great!
I'm trying.
I was definitely lucky.
What first song did you ever write?
Tom could screw himself up.
I just want to get away.
Denmark continued to follow Fadil's example.
A lot of words are borrowed from foreign languages.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I'm mad at Tom.
Every other day Bill goes fishing.
Don't let her get you out of this good chance.
What time are you breakfast?
Be careful.
He's in the first year of college.
I looked for grape juice.
I meant my family.
The colorless green ideas sleep angry.
Can you make Tom laugh?
Because of the bad time, the plane was late.
Can I take your dictionary?
My liquid language knowledge is enough for many situations, but not to express my, often mutually contradictive, emotions.
I was in a great mood.
I'm a professor.
There's nothing to do in this town.
Tom's a screwber.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book's on the shelf.
I often feel a heartbreaking.
Tom's on a secret mission.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of a snake.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I slipped once.
Show me the photos!
She fantasized to become a nurse.
I'm sorry I'm always interrupting you.
Tom's risking everything.
He's a man of power.
That's wonderful!
I'm a goal.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it in time?
It's weird that the postman hasn't come yet.
Try to do one thing at a time.
How do we prevent that from happening?
His novels are favorite among young people.
There's a cat.
I hope Tom will remember this.
Did I really be so happy?
I'll buy a boat soon.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
She was surprised to hear the news.
He's not an American, he's an Englishman.
How do you say "Thank you" in Japanese?
There were no injuries.
Did you ever get a fast ride punishment?
I'll be right upstairs.
We have to go.
Tom's a mechanic.
His accident taught me a lot.
Are we ready to leave?
Why?
The storm shouldn't affect our plans.
Tom's a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There's no girlfriend on the Internet.
She tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go out and walk.
As most of the 18-year-olds, Tom is not sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi wrote a lot of musical works for a fagot.
U.S. Secretary John Carrie broke his right butt bone in a bicycle accident on Sunday in France.
Where a lot of grandmothers, the pounds are kids.
Tom's tense like a string.
Never lose hope.
Sounds simple, I know.
It was just a slipper on the cake.
How long has it been since you stopped teaching in that school?
Tom seemed very confused.
The results were incredible.
Pick one.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes have screwed up.
Have you completely recovered?
He got what he wanted.
I'll listen.
The job's already done.
Tom was speaking very loud.
She drinks like a smoke.
Don't move!
There was an accident recorded by the observer.
Did I drop it?
Are you happy?
This is the dumbest thing I've ever said.
I wish I knew Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship has gradually turned into love.
There's a saying in China that you can't judge a man in the appearance.
It's in vain.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the dest side is in New York.
They need each other.
What the fuck is going on here?
There are indications that the reception, which is known by its luxury dishes, this year will be something more modest.
Did you report to the police?
He surrendered.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
What about you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom will do that.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Where are you going?
I'm sorry if I disappointed you.
Violent criminals were often violent in childhood.
Meet me with Tom.
After a long consideration, I finally randomly did things.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man who saves the words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to me for dinner yesterday.
Look what he's like!
Live truth.
You're very inappropriate.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now it's a great time to buy that.
You're absolutely right.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom got out of it.
Tom's been interfering with people who should never have been involved with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and write.
Tom's ruthless.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's the problem you have to solve yourself.
I've been exaggerating.
Termites eat a tree.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom dropped the book.
This should work.
You failed me.
You don't have to judge a man according to his appearance.
It's unconnected.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thank you for the e-mail!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
They'll make speeches tomorrow.
What's this?
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was going to be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as his weakest member.
I've been there before.
Me too.
That's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
So what are your plans?
Kids are sleeping.
That was very good.
You need a temporary bridge.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
This town, like many towns in England, has quite a long history.
Tom closed the door.
I didn't have fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Where's your stuff?
Tom worked very hard and broke a lot of money.
I don't like being socialized.
Tom's alone in the living room.
He lived a simple life.
We offered help.
It was a dark and storm night.
That smells delicious.
The first phase is over.
You'll be famous.
He's got a lot of money, even a surplus.
We're glad to have you here.
Can I have another glass of beer?
Tom was sure of himself.
Sit down for a second, please.
It's Copacabana!
I wonder how Tom feels.
She's taking care of her old mother.
You're the most boring person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I have plants.
I bought dozens of pencils today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Does French learn in your school?
That can't be true.
Tom looked left and right before he crossed the street.
Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom's gonna recover.
You're important to me.
I don't expect anything from you.
Go straight.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't get into it.
I'm used to nobody likes me.
The brakes are scratching.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
Just like a bean.
I'm a little worried now.
Do you have a stable relationship with the boy?
Tom still knows he's saying the song he wrote when he was 13 years old.
It's empty.
Did you see Tom gone?
Be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm ready to pay you well to do that.
Where did you get that idea?
What are you talking about?
That was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
Many of them admire him.
I hope it'll be a good time tomorrow.
Mary squeezed.
Let's sit down.
Come and look at it.
Tom really seems familiar.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
I'm quitting.
Do your kids have their own rooms?
Tom kept all the letters that Mary sent to him.
Go swim with Tom.
He's safe.
Tom died in his dream.
The woman's shifner is not full without a small black dress.
I can't sit down.
Finish this.
We don't have a choice, but kill.
Where's the bathroom here?
Happy resurrection!
Tom helped me save a dinar by telling me about a cheaper place where it could be bought.
I owe you an apology.
There's nothing else to do but admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's been working his whole life.
Knock it out!
Where are you going?
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
I need to fix my watch.
Tom will live.
Please read between lines.
You won!
That's a bad sign.
I understood wrong.
Tom had dinner with Mary.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really so happy?
I'm good with the kids.
I'm gonna be late.
I had lunch fast.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the road.
You should leave Tom a message.
You always lie to me.
Just in time!
I want to want what you want.
Health is a wealth.
Tom has a family now.
That doesn't surprise me.
As far as I know, he never came in time.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
The boy throws a stone.
Can I call you in 20 minutes?
The wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
As little as we know about her origin, at least we can be sure that the pilot is Evangelion.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom's on the bus.
Can you leave us alone?
I almost forgot my passport.
Why are you doing this if I can ask?
The deer is faster than stronger.
People used to write books to knocking machines.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
I live in Sarajevo.
I reacted instinctively.
It's a toilet.
Tom doesn't see anything wrong with letting Mary learn to drive.
Are you coming back now?
I want to fuck you.
I hope not.
Give me one example.
How could I hate Tom?
Wear this.
What a barbarian!
What day is it tomorrow?
I've always known that.
Tom thought I was you.
I'm looking forward to your letter.
When the cat's gone, the mouse wheels water.
We need this from Tom.
The king of Japan rules the emperor and the Spanish king.
It's Ali's book.
Will we see Tom again?
The world was alone the edge of nuclear war during the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962.
Have fun while you can.
I'm sure I'm gonna win that tennis match.
Are you disclexic?
Melanie's drinking milk.
Where did you see Tom?
It's all quiet again.
I'm engaged.
Can we order, please?
What's he doing?
Anyway, what's your address?
What I saw was depressing.
They laughed at me.
I'm angry.
Take it easy, Tom.
Can you give an example?
I don't intend to go to Bustom with you this weekend.
He stole a very precious diamond ring.
That's my cat.
Tom drinks like a smoke.
It's like old times.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Is that what you want?
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't exaggerate.
Look at that.
We have your size, but not that color.
That doesn't look like you.
He's always here between 5 and 6:00.
Tom was received to the hospital.
I hope I can do that.
I don't like stubborn people.
Setting all day is bad for you.
The rain season starts in June.
You always do.
That's totally normal.
You're out of luck, Tom.
The wall seemed smooth and unprocessed.
Do you hear anything?
He's got two cars.
Tom's probably gonna still be mad.
He said hello and left.
Welcome to Tatebe.
I see, I don't see.
I'm bleeding.
I'm glad you answered.
We're close friends.
We can't be friends anymore.
In the future, many workers will be replaced by robots.
Tom was totally drunk.
I admit I'm wrong.
That house belongs to him.
My father listens to classical music.
Who?
How many people live on Earth?
I'm a little worried now.
Come again any time.
We're from Russia.
Let it be for you.
Which I should do my free time.
We need to keep working.
We had a terrible fight.
Who ate the last doughnut?
Are you free tonight?
If I love you, what's your business?
You don't speak English.
They've been handling.
They recognized Tom.
Tom was afraid of me before.
Everyone you meet leads a battle you don't know anything about, be kind, always.
I'm afraid of death.
Don't run.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
Tom is my older brother.
One man was arrested and accused of a deliberate murder of 25-year-old Mary Thompson.
Come on, you two.
The film was inspired by a novel of the same title.
Peter loves Jane.
Is this a real diamond?
I don't want to be cruel.
Are you free tonight?
Do you have time to help me?
This is clear in itself.
Tom's mad.
Tom's gonna try to get there in time.
Tom says I'm too aggressive.
What does that mean?
We'll never know the reason.
My favorite teacher was Jackson.
Tom's tired.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
I have to do what's right.
I like to watch you dance.
They replaced coal with oil.
John came to Japan yesterday.
It's snow falling.
We've already decided not to do that.
How can I say that in your language?
That's not a good sign.
He's a doctor, and besides a writer.
It's hers, isn't it?
We're really holding up.
I don't live here.
I gave my mother nineteen flowers for Mother's day.
I hope you like it.
This card is worth a month.
I didn't tell him you were here.
No one knows what's going on behind that door.
I think Tom's pretty angry.
I'll call you as soon as I get there.
Turns out the price was lower than I thought.
Some think the spontaneous inflammation of people is really happening, but I'm not very sure.
Who's gonna read such a fat book?
It's good to see you again.
We'll visit you sometime.
I disagree.
You have to focus on your virtues.
You taught us that.
Tom can't come to work today because he doesn't feel well.
I'm a terrible writer.
We could achieve what we started before.
They live in a white house with a fashioned brick on the corner on the left side of the street.
I'm sure Tom didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
It's too loud for me here.
I'm alone.
Why are you acting like this?
I'm really upset about that.
Tom's alone.
If she was a little more patient, she could have done it.
Whatever you're doing, don't laugh.
Why don't you tell me what's really bothering you?
I don't understand why Tom would want to do that.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
I'm not sure what time I should be there.
Don't open it.
Tom's already here.
I work at the hospital.
I already told Tom that.
They were singing Hawaii songs.
Tom spoke almost crying.
He's not missing anything.
We live in the atomic age.
Die!
I can't wait.
Norway surprised me.
My uncle has a big family.
I never liked biology.
It was necessary to do a lot of things about the preparations for the trip.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I had lunch with him.
I'm tired of arguing.
Little kids don't know a lot of words.
Where's she going?
Mary's earning for life sewing.
Don't drink water from the dirty glass!
We won!
Tom ran inside.
Where's Tom gonna sleep?
How does Tom do that?
All their efforts were in vain.
Did you sleep enough last night?
Tom asked me if I wanted to go to Boston with him.
The only word written on the page was "frog."
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Do you speak Italian?
It wasn't the only reason I left Mary.
"Do you have a nickname?" "Yes, Rick."
I've stayed.
Tom ate a bit of pie.
Who told you to write with your left hand?
You should have told me.
Don't exaggerate.
I don't have anything out of my hand today.
Really?
This is Brian Rock.
You can do better than that.
Tom's not an expert.
We came to London to look at the comedy.
Why are you alone?
The underministered government officials fled the country.
How much blood did the injured lose?
I won't bother you.
Two guys ran out of the room.
It's never too late to learn.
Please come to my house for a while.
First we have to find them.
This one's pretty cool.
I have strong reasons to believe that my son Sergio Melo today, on May 11, 2014, registered at Tataeba as a 20,000 member!
I think that's quite great.
Tom was very scared.
I speak Bosnian.
Are we arriving soon?
Snow falls.
I didn't recognize the melody.
I'm from Turkey.
Just tell me the truth.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
That's when I didn't speak French liquidly.
I spent a lot of nights screwed up in bed watching TV.
The guard's out there.
Do you have any rooms?
Can I call about 2:30?
I'm really lucky about that.
Well, things like that happen.
That's a nice sweater.
Actually, I don't like Tom so much.
I didn't really want to do that.
Tom didn't see anything.
You're stupid.
Tom looked a lot different after the haircut.
Tom called Mary for dinner.
We're not gonna stay here.
Interesting.
Music, after silence, is what approximately shows inexplicit.
We walked all the way to the next station.
I have two daughters.
I really didn't have any money.
Tom's down to hide.
Have the courage.
Let's rest for five minutes.
I believe science.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
Don't complicate it, Tom.
She smiled.
Just give us a chance.
Be careful.
Tom came out on the stage.
Tom's going on my nerves.
Take another one.
Two men were partners in business.
I'm learning now.
I almost forgot my passport.
It's rumour that this house has been employed by ghosts.
Is 10,000 yen gonna be enough?
I'm not used to it.
I have to do some more things.
I trusted you my secret and you betrayed me.
I read Chinese firmly, but I can't write it well.
I can write a message to Tom if you want.
Why don't you take off the sweater?
I wonder what Tom intends to do.
I can't cheer him up.
There was a lot to eat.
This hour is cheaper than that.
Regular use of agrum will reduce pores and refresh the skin.
Eva gave Adam the apple of knowledge.
Looks like most people are barbecue only in the summer.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
When did you come home?
He asked me to help him.
This is not true.
I did my first step.
This is easy.
I know as much as you do.
They're terrifying.
They're just trying to help.
Tom told me he wanted to be a doctor.
I owe my father what I am.
Emily's English.
I asked him a lot of questions about the ecology.
Why are you still awake?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in town.
I thought you were going to the Boss bus.
We're going for a walk.
Can you keep a secret?
I thought you already took care of it.
I remember everything.
Don't stop.
Tom was shot three times.
Don't cheat.
You never know what can happen.
You do good to those who hate you.
I slipped once.
Good afternoon, how are you?
He doesn't speak English.
What's your favorite TV star?
Tom fainted.
How was your day?
He's not the type of person who's stealing.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
We can talk about it in the future.
We won't let you down.
Don't waste words in vain.
We don't have a lot of visitors down here.
I love him, but he's pretty often too sensitive.
She divorced her husband.
Many languages describe death and dying.
Did you do that on purpose?
Don't get caught.
I wish I could take a picture like that.
I'm loyal.
Tom likes cheese.
What did you tell Tom?
I know this will cause you more trouble but nothing can be done.
You have to let it go.
What's your job?
Tom hasn't written to me for a long time.
Tom never told me what he wanted to eat.
Could you read it?
I didn't want to hurt you.
Hello.
Tom's gonna work.
Tom's a living proof that you don't have to be smart to be successful.
Tom's a busy guy.
You look very pale.
This is a good handbook.
I lost my mind flow.
Do you speak Italian?
Tom pulled out some personal ticket.
You embarrass her.
My phone's gonna turn off soon.
Tom convinced Mary to invite John to the party.
Wait, what are you trying to do?
Let's stretch the legs.
I'm going on my way.
That would be all for now.
Interestingly, is he coming today?
The powerless must be protected from the mighty.
I don't know if these languages are related.
I thought you were gonna be busy.
I want to hire a car, please show me the price.
How long does the turtle live?
Didn't you do enough?
I'm very optimistic about this.
I think Tom was trying to impress me.
They appear here to enjoy the ice fountain, beer and a trip basket.
Tom told me not to do that.
We went all the way to Boston together.
How long have you been a teacher?
Weapon manufacturers should donate their money to organisations that can help countries in war.
Do you think I should write Tom?
We don't have a example like that.
We found footprints in the sand.
We ran out of the building.
All right, what about you?
There's no free lunch.
Mary's a very individualist girl.
We can't let our emotions ruin our actions.
She's my professor.
Tom and I have been close friends for years.
I think this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.
Tom knows what he likes.
Tom was very sleepy.
This building will be built in town.
Come closer.
Come on!
What are you reading?
How many phone numbers does she have?
Dad, can you read me a story before I go to sleep?
Don't go out tonight.
Don't get hard!
Can you wake me up at seven tomorrow morning?
She's always going to work at 8 a.m.
No dispute has been completed forever. It will always swim to the surface again.
I'm eating a lot of meat.
I'm just a average girl.
He's working slowly.
I'm a starter.
This tea is good.
I miss you so much.
Cover your mouth while you cough, sneeze or eat.
I'm ready.
I'm against war.
She's walking.
He's got a nice patch on him.
Tom didn't give me that.
You know you're deactivating the bomb?
I've already tried it.
You're my mother.
Italy is not Greece.
I'm just not very happy.
I don't live in this town.
I bought this yesterday.
Do you speak Greek?
I'll cooperate.
I hope it won't rain tomorrow.
Give me an example.
It all happened with the speed of light.
A fight!
That's really nice.
They called me worse.
How did I overlook that?
I'm not surprised at all.
I saved you a place next to me.
Looks like the victim tried to write the killer's name with his own blood.
Being powerful is like being a lady, and if you have a need to tell people you are, you're not.
Tom could have something to do with it.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
What's your story?
Where's Lori?
Have you been in an accident?
I'll tell Tom if I don't forget.
I'm leaving.
I pissed him off.
That's very rare.
I was pretending not to see.
I was trying to be kind.
Can you ask her to call me?
I was pretending not to see.
Did you see my dogs?
It was dark.
Don't yell.
You know your rights.
You can't get in that room.
That's the point.
The whole city was under water.
I didn't know where I was from.
I'm naked.
What are they calling him?
Tom tried the button.
Can you add salt?
I'm ashamed that my son did such a thing.
Success was just partial.
He's always going to work at 8 a.m.
I'm not 100 per cent sure.
Want to bet?
He didn't like his nose's look, so he did a nose surgery.
Beth told Chris to take a bath or she won't go out with him for a meeting.
I didn't tell her you were here.
Tom bought a drink for everyone.
He detailed his flight.
Tom knows the Secretary of State.
Tom just got home.
Stop smoking.
The insurance officer's overheated.
Don't answer.
I have an aunt living in Kyoto.
Ladies first.
It can't be hard; otherwise, women couldn't do that.
I'm glad people saw that.
She's not ugly.
I'm sick of his preaching.
No one would talk to me.
Peter and Lech are also good friends.
I didn't tell him you were here.
I have a gun.
We're overpaid to the papers.
Tom seems very nice.
We all live under the same sky, but we don't have the same horizon.
I can't imagine doing that.
My father has a good job.
He's got a good memory.
Tom has a good mentor.
I came back today.
Here's a little secret.
How much money does he make a month?
What a stupid question!
I'm anxious.
We protested peacefully.
Mary was angry as a rice.
Get up and introduce yourself, please.
We're all eager to see a movie.
You have to solve your problems alone.
Where do you live, Tom?
He was happy to laugh.
Tom has good notes.
That's not the reason for panic.
I'm glad Tom won.
Tom celebrated his mature anniversary last week.
I'll sit down at a table there.
Why are you so good at explaining things?
Turn left.
Who's first?
Don't get tired!
Your book is twice as much as mine.
My third husband bought me this.
I know as much as you do.
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
I'm thorough.
Let's take a look.
Tom writes something in the diary every night, no matter how tired he is.
Have you planned something special?
My parents died.
Most scientists believe that this is caused by human action, by dropping metans, carbon dioxide and other glass gases since industrialization, but still a few other scientists doubt this.
Will I be replaced?
Earth is a planet.
I can resist everything, except the temptation.
All you need to do is practice.
I paid for it.
Again, please.
I didn't say I did it.
They know you.
You were right to worry.
I'd like you to keep an eye on my dog while I'm out.
I'm confused.
She has a good heart.
Did you bring a fan?
How long do I have left?
Can you explain how to get to the airport?
I'm not taking the job.
I'm intrigued.
Does that happen often?
You can't rely on Tom.
You're a little reminder of Tom.
Everything's normal.
If you do.
Did you write the number?
You're under oath.
I fainted.
I wish I knew.
I haven't seen you here before.
I don't think so.
There's about 300 miles from here to Boston.
Tom asked me more money than he really needed.
Tom managed to save just a little money.
I'm going to get out of work early today.
Are you enjoying business?
She was wearing a black hat.
Are you looking for something specific?
Her composition is very good, except a few mistakes in the excuse.
English is considered an international language.
Don't worry!
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
I'm a monk.
I live in Boston right now.
Ania has black, and Magdalena's blue hair.
Why did you decide to stop using Twitter?
I'm not a philosopher.
Am I a suspect?
I could help.
For God's sake!
Didn't you do enough?
All animals are equal.
I doubt Tom will give you the keys.
I didn't give anything.
I feel like it's going to rain.
Caroline's sad because she can't get pregnant.
He's got a few friends.
Did you sleep?
I don't want meat.
What are you hiding now?
Stop trying to make me guilty.
Tom seems a little freaked out.
I am indeed happy for that.
Drive faster.
I'm trying.
I have no idea what he's talking about.
That's definitely not a reason to worry.
I took off my wig.
My life was good.
It's my cat.
There's a large amount of smaller mistakes and a small misunderstanding that distort the meaning of the original sentence.
I haven't had any complaints before.
I can ski.
He's standing there.
Are you afraid of rats?
I was at the reception.
He's known as a great painter.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
Now you're lying to me.
Did Tom ever answer you?
Go look for Tom.
Tom did his best.
Shoot your feet!
"Are you serious?" "I'm serious."
Why are you mad at me?
I'd be more comfortable in the morning.
That didn't like the way Mary spoke to him.
We need to find out.
You're sad.
What's your name in Bosnian?
Tom has to learn more if he's thinking about finishing his class.
I'm sick of fighting.
I wrote a song about what happened here last year.
I can't try it!
It's too easy that way.
Where did that come from?
I'm not gonna tell anyone you did it.
The bears are very dangerous.
Really?
We know you're a coward.
I bought some books from the bookstore.
We had to call the police last night.
I'm worried about you.
Have they ever experienced a car accident?
She's Prime Minister of Finland.
Please come pick me up.
I like how you arranged the apartment.
She decided not to go.
Tom traveled to the legendary Orient Express from Paris to Istanbul.
You're lying!
It's a fish.
Tom already knew about it.
I did it, didn't I?
No one noticed she was away until the meeting was over.
She's honest.
Who's running a meeting today?
How did you find out where Tom is?
You're not rational.
These are my best friends.
Don't go through that with me.
Give me a day or two.
She confessed everything.
Tom used to drive a bus.
Do you want some coffee?
The fall of many birds move to the south.
The forbidden fruit is always the sweetest.
This article was written in English.
Some of you need help.
Sugar replaced the honey as a sugar.
You're just gonna make a big mistake.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I'll go.
What's all this mess about?
Can you please turn off the radio for me?
There's a bus station near our school.
Don't drink water.
I'm adopted.
No one knows what's going to happen next.
I made my decision.
Do you have a copy?
Next Monday and Tuesday are holidays.
We're going to the movie.
I don't understand why they're so good friends.
Dan's a lingvisist.
I wouldn't hurt her.
This is a book.
In this stage of world history, in America there is no such thing as an independent press. You know that and I know that. There is no one among you who dares to write his sincere opinion, and if he would have written it in advance, he would know that it will never appear in the press. I get regularly my pay to keep my sincere opinion out of the newspaper for which I am working for. Many of you are also paid for similar things, and anyone of you who would be so crazy to write what he honestly thinks would find himself out outside, in looking for some other work. If I had let my right opinion appear only in one edition of the newspapers for which I work, I would get fired from work for less than 24 hours. The job of the journalist is to destroy the truth, to lie, to distort what he honestly thinks, to find himself out out outside, looking for some other jobs. That I have let my right opinion appear in one of the country and its people, minute for their daily hours.
I'm not really worried.
The bedroom's upstairs.
It's mine, it's not his.
I could use some help.
What's wrong with you?
I wasn't too surprised.
Tom failed to convince Mary to make a cake for John's birthday party.
Tom writes very well.
Tom screwed himself.
I watched Tom die.
She hated him.
It's my favorite shirt, and I always wash it on my hands.
You kind of let me think you want me to invite you out.
It is recommended that you do not write your passwords where others can see them.
That's so funny.
Look again.
How could I do that?
Did you eat anything?
Tom gave great support.
The silk is expensive.
What are you gonna do today?
I'd rather not be involved in this stage, thank you.
It only happens occasionally.
I know your face.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
I'd like to tell you the truth.
I'm not sure Tom wants to talk to me.
If you're out, please close the door.
I can't believe I forgot.
The cab is expensive.
Open up.
Do you love your mother?
I didn't know much about Australia.
Tom's gonna recover.
There's no use trying to convince him.
That's right.
Let's be friends.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
You'll probably never see me again.
The milk path is a huge belt of remote stars similar to our sun.
Who's that?
I could talk to Tom.
He lives in a white house.
I thought you were happy here.
I thought Tom was doing fine.
I could come with you.
I'm excited.
I invited him.
He's a man with great experience.
Beautiful blonde sunned on the beach.
The logic is obviously your stronger side.
We're trying.
Luckily, Tom didn't hurt himself seriously.
I need your help.
Stop!
The airline will make sure to send your baggage to the final destination as soon as possible, or later if that's what a passenger wants.
I was just too busy.
The most beautiful flowers have the sharpest trunks.
What's this about?
I'd like to kiss you.
He owned a lot of land, once a long time ago.
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
Tom laughed at the idea.
She was wearing intrusive clothes.
I'll be right there.
He was terribly thin.
I'm sorry.
How did she look?
We can't go back.
He told me I was cute.
The coloseum was used by 217, but then the lightning hit him and burned.
My father's so old that he can't work.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
How desperate are you?
It's time to go to bed.
You're absolutely right.
I think he's an enemy.
You deserve it.
I'm working.
Does Tom have a lawyer?
You changed my life.
Can I take your dictionary?
He ran away from her.
If a man has a right to life, then he should have the right to death.
All teachers were young and loved to teach.
Faith makes miracles!
He kept the air.
Tom's a Knowledge.
Congratulations!
The bird on the roof is a crow.
My house is far away.
I've never really been anywhere.
We're in a difficult situation.
I'll check it out now.
Check it again.
Come with us, please.
Sam's missing some board in his head.
You don't look good.
What's the name of that restaurant?
How do I call a cab?
There's a lot of beautiful parks in London.
Tom kissed his anger.
I've got a back ticket to Tokyo.
When did you come home?
They know you.
You didn't answer the question.
This dictionary has written 1,000 words with that all of them must be remembered until July.
It's too loud for me here.
There's a good chance we're gonna win.
We have to go back.
Do you think it's possible to pass all the exams?
It would be different.
They're all there.
Is that your car?
Did you bring a fan?
He was naked and bossed.
Did you talk about me?
Tom's gonna give up.
You got a headache?
I can ski.
Why do you think that?
Today's snow falling.
You should write a message to Tom.
It hurts my head today.
She insisted on him going to the hospital.
I think Tom pulled out a thicker end.
It doesn't play any role anymore.
I'll fix my homework tomorrow.
Get help.
Tom's suffering from chronic pain.
By the way, where do you live?
Tom installed solar panels on the roof of his house.
I want you to find out if Tom and Mary are planning to be alone here.
He lives in England.
It's awful down here.
Who wants to talk to me?
What a shock!
We tried to stop Tom.
Love and be loved is the greatest happiness.
Get out of here.
I'm guilty.
Who wants to talk to me?
Bring backup.
He was two years younger than I did.
We just arrived here today.
Come stay with me.
Bring me her head.
I wasn't wearing intrusive clothes.
I thought you wouldn't want that.
When she was in Los Angeles, she had at least six different jobs.
You embarrass him.
Because of her physical deficiencies, Mary uses a stick to walk when she's out.
You can just tell us the truth.
The door of the office is yellow.
I think Tom needs help.
I'm usually not in the office Monday.
Dad, can you read me a story before I go to bed?
Lemon contains lemon acid.
We'll never catch Tom.
I have a lot of friends.
Croatia was so beautiful.
I ruined school.
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
We'll stop it.
Tom wants his money today.
Have you finished washing the dishes?
Can I use your dictionary?
Is it yours?
You told me that before.
Are you honest?
Tom thought Mary wouldn't have to do that.
Tom works as a waiter, but he's looking for a better job.
The road is direct.
I need more coffee.
Television is not involved in electricity.
The house is made of brick.
Everybody's lying.
Damn it, can you imagine how much they smelled?
Do you love your mother?
You should get a new car now.
I made my first step.
I'm downstairs.
Be tolerant.
What's going to happen next time?
Would you like fruit juice?
Tom's the best student in class.
I assumed you were busy.
Go away.
Tom changed his name.
Can you help us?
I wasn't nervous about that.
Are you coming back now?
My name is Hashimoto.
It's comfortable.
He lost hope and killed himself with poison.
You spyed on me.
It's the night, the family of dinner.
Better ever than never.
We're never going back there.
Are we going home?
And if I were rich, I wouldn't give him the money.
I was wrong this morning.
You can do better than that.
Is everything settled now?
Have you seen my dogs?
Stay calm.
One day he'll be mine.
I have a few friends.
Give Tom a drink.
I'm sick of it!
He walked despite her disturbance.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom could speak French.
I feel a sharp stomach pain.
You have to lie down.
That was awful.
Can I replace this?
They didn't know me.
What a nice car!
There are islands on the sea.
Are these bananas mature?
You're sad.
You're very rude.
I could kill you now.
The soldier wake Layla with a blow.
I know what you're probably thinking.
Tell me why you did that.
Can you take me to the airport tomorrow morning?
Please kick as strong as you can.
I'm not gonna let you do that.
I think I can save you a while.
Then I'll see what I can do!
Would you like some more tomato juice?
Maybe it's not enough.
That really liked his job.
Are you done?
I agreed to buy that.
Can you come?
Yes or not?
Speaking English is fun.
After death, he showed that she was drowned.
Tom's gonna die.
It's just like this:
It was serious.
How was the French class?
Someone probably told him, but it wasn't me.
The butterfly is just unique.
Without torture, there's no science.
Stay positive.
The city was damaged during the war.
I pissed him off.
Give yourself some time.
Tom can't even write his own name yet.
Feel like home.
Thank you for the information.
What's your material status?
They need each other.
Was that what he was mistaken?
Take it easy, but hurry up.
The rumour has spread throughout the city.
Time's flying.
Some Mr. Itoh wants to see you.
The cat is not a man!
I'm good at a lot of things.
I don't like to be surprised.
Come here.
You should eat more vegetables.
The best way to lose a kill is to eat less and exercise more.
This is gonna be a fun weekend.
What's your name?
Tom's gonna think about it again.
It wasn't too cold.
Tom wrote me over 30 messages yesterday.
I hope she won't notice my mistake.
I bought a cactus.
I'm a little worried now.
Now we need the truth.
The game's over.
Is that a bird?
Is breakfast calculated at the price?

Please, give me the sauce.
The spaceship was destroyed.
How does Tom work?
Be careful.
Do you have a paper I can write on?
He was walking the street.
Dogs lay.
She came alone.
Do you agree with that?
Where's the museum?
We just had dinner.
I'm sure they need you.
That's good.
You're one of us.
Do you have a dog?
I saw the cat.
Why is love so complicated?
I've been there before.
Tom's book is at the top of the Christmas Sale of Books, and it's hard to get some book out of position.
Tom's working for Mary now.
I'm armed.
Is it necessary to make such a rumor?
Sami's missing some board in his head.
I have an old bike.
Did you wash the dishes?
He didn't come to the last meeting.
Good morning!
Give me another reason.
Let's have a drink!
Your secret is safe with us.
Am I wrong?
You need a hobby.
I assumed you were busy.
On the next crossroad, turn right.
I told you it didn't work.
And you, Brute?
Are you disclexic?
I wish I just knew.
I'm often borrowing books from Tom.
Change your clothes.
That's all I could find.
A great group of people gathered together.
I'm working on my project.
Everything is well prepared ahead.
I'm not counting on that.
I don't know what that is.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
He's poor but too proud to ask for help.
"Who's in the car?" "Mary."
They gave water to their horses.
I got down on the wrong bus station.
I'll give you everything you want.
Girls were wearing grass skirts and they had flowers around their neck.
Can you call the doctor?
The world is unjust.
Do you know she likes animals?
Tom's the only feeder in the family.
He may have already gone.
He started yelling.
Don't be rude to me!
You're wrong.
This could take weeks.
You can format and adjust the cross budget table, insert and use regular tables, diagrams, formulas and functions.

Come to my house.
Call me anytime, on my shoulder, you can always cry.
I'm reformed.
What's going to happen next time?
Mr. Wood came to the door and told Tony's mother.
The doctors are still trying to save Tom.
No one trusted her.
He doesn't even know French.
We watched the bird feed their young ones.
Detectives are still investigating.
Tom was pretty fine.
This sad story was written when Tom was in exile.
Tom's not like the other boys.
We'll take the stairs.
She drinks like a fish.
I'm sure I'm gonna win that tennis match.
Do you have anything to say?
Get changed.
We should have brought another bottle of wine.
He was dressed like a woman.
Men want to feel desirable.
She tried.
You shouldn't send that e-mail.
You don't mind, do you?
How would you feel if your wife left you?
Can you prove that?
I'm sorry.
It's easy to write with this pen.
Tom called his homicide Cookie.
Are you ready for more?
Don't change your opinions so often.
This pen's not working.
Did you see me dance?
I don't like learning at this kind of hot.
I'd rather not be involved in that at this moment.
Tom closed the fence.
I had dinner with him.
There's nothing to do in this village.
I really hope I'm wrong.
Are you busy here?
Tom used to play a guitar.
He's a man of experience.
I'm actually a nice guy.
That likes both of them.
It must have been horrible.
Your plan sounds great.
You sound amazed.
I'll borrow you a workbox if you promise me you won't write anything on it.
My friends live in the same house as I do.
There's a lot of bad people in the world.
Did Tom find him?
Are they in love?
Where do we meet tomorrow?
The house is in his possession.
Tom saved Mary.
What do we want?
Tom's deaf like a cannon.
Latin is the language of the future!
I think they're all ready.
"Have you seen my cell phone?" "It's on the table."
You'll see her.
Tom has a dark secret.
Did you eat anything?
Let's make it clear.
Stiglić is a very interesting bird.
It doesn't make sense to wait.
The connection between the personality and the blood group is not scientifically confirmed.
I thought you were married.
The cat came under the table.
I'm singing.
It's Tom.
Your house is big.
If you spend a lot of time in there, you can exercise your knees as high as you can walk or walk in the place.
You're everything for me.
I want to get married.
Hold my backpack.
I checked some things.
Tom knew Mary didn't love him.
I'm not singing.
It was love at first.
I'd like to kiss you.
Kids play outside.
Are you coming soon?
Many young Romans have gone to Greece.
The plan was dismissed as irregular.
I don't want to go to school.
Did you manage to do it yourself?
The working group dealing with data transfers, managed by Ben Manny, will hold a meeting on January 14, 1999.
Some say if you get on the rainbow, it'll start raining.
At my beginning, it's my end.
I just arrived.
I have to go to the mosque.
I mean, so I did.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
He knew how to talk to young women himself.
What should I see?
Did you decide what you're going to do?
Don't bother!
Tom knows knocking very fast.
I can't answer you right now.
Are we all here?
I'll be right back with your order.
My sister's playing with dolls.
I want a sword like this!
Identify yourself.
Take the money.
Tom still looks surprised.
I'm saving to buy a new saxophone.
Don't give up just like that.
He soon recovered from shock.
I give you what you want.
It's a pure escappism.
Who did you write a letter to?
Maybe I'll need some help.
Karin's Austrian.
Does this mean you don't love me anymore?
I'm not a specialist.
I'm more creepy than I look.
No one's here.
Tom's youngest daughter is his favorite.
You're sad.
Tom bought the papers and read them on the train.
Focus your camera on the flower.
I'm not gonna be home next week.
When I was a kid, I often visited him on Sunday.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
That would be okay.
What do you call it?
Welcome back.
How does Tom know French?
I like to watch you work.
Answer me now.
There's no politics established.
Write what I say.
The rain's finally stopping.
I live in an old house.
Redheads are driving me crazy!
Do you love your mother?
He finally fulfilled my request.
It was a big explosion.
Tom blinked.
I didn't walk out today.
Did they tell you the reason?
Can you spell my name?
Look at this.
I have an aunt who lives in Kyoto.
She was saving her head alive.
What wine do you have?
Do you think she did it?
I think we should call the doctor.
Life in Tokyo is very expensive.
You're so early today.
We caught Tom at work.
We need to be realistic.
She took off her clothes.
Tom's house is for sale.
Tom wasn't satisfied with the results.
I hid under the table.
They're holding me hostage.
I think this is obvious.
Emma was very impressive at the party.
Maybe Tom wasn't hungry.
I've been there before.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Tom asked Mary how she liked the new job.
I'm a big football fan.
What are you going to do with all this?
Mary's making money for life sewing.
Can you give me some water, please?
Where's your friend?
Terrorists released hostages.
I don't know what to think about this.
I don't like it at all.
Tom's used to winning.
Elementary, my dear Watson.
Tom's not sure what he wants to do with his life.
Tom asked Mary if he could lend her English manual.
We're here for you.
Call security!
My scarf is blue.
The earth is too small.
I'm intrigued.
What do you believe?
What do you want?
The medicinal products should not be mixed mostly with alcohol.
The bakery is next to the mess.
Did you see who that was?
Try this.
When I woke up, snow fell.
Some people, no matter how old they are, don't lose their beauty.
Tom adopted a Russian sentence.
I've played golf with Tom a lot of times.
Don't talk.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
That's pretty extraordinary.
Tom got his shoulders down.
It'll happen bad things.
Why would Tom come now?
I panicked.
Come on, try it now.
We'd better get in there.
Actually, I'm not sure.
Explore her.
I'm very impressed.
She was dressed in red.
I should talk to my dad about it.
What does the Sovietologist study?
It's all a big joke.
Tom was talking about music.
Where's the dog?
Have you completely recovered?
We argued a lot.
Tom's still hiding.
All right, what about you?
We're the same soy.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
Keep working.
Hope gets lost when you experience a difficult situation and a senseless brake.
I was laughing.
You have to stop smoking.

Did you see me dancing?
Better shut up!
Tom and Mary decided to adopt John.
The baby's asleep.
Did you eat anything?
Tom's not in any danger.
It's too easy.
All men are the same.
He's not a kid anymore.
We're almost done.
Is it clean?
They haven't wake up yet.
Everything's free.
Welcome.
We don't have a choice.
I've never really been anywhere.
He keeps losing his cell phone.
I'm angry.
My friend was shocked when I told her.
I think Tom could do that.
I'm thinking about going to Australia, too.
I'm sure Tom will win.
Are the Americans really so individual?
I asked Tony a question.
You can go play with your friends when you're done cleaning up the house.
That's my problem, not yours.
Tom came to Mary's birthday party.
What's your specialization?
He couldn't laugh at her jokes.
She released the bird from the cage.
I'm double older than Tom.
You're the love of my life.
Tom couldn't talk to Mary, and he couldn't influence it.
And now that I remember everything I've experienced, I've really learned a lot of things.
That's exactly what I wanted to say.
I wasn't too surprised.
I saw him pull something like a pot out of the box.
What's your name in Bosnian?
Do you know how this machine works?
Tom managed to find a job in Boston.
You're my luck.
The team is as strong as his weakest member.
Thank you very much for everything!

The cat is not a man!
When was the last time you heard from Tom?
Hungarian language is not easy, but it's beautiful.
I'm not looking at TV.
I love France.
He's good.
Did you know that?
I think so, too.
Are you ready?
The money's talking.
He's my rival in business.
I prefer a tent with a storm cover, along with the crossed sticks for stability on the wind and the snow inflammation, and this has to be a two-style tent.
Tell Tom I'll say hello.
That's very sensitive.
This is my wife Edita.
I can't be something I'm not.
She lost money, family, friends.
Now present yourself using these sentences!
My name's not "ty"; it's Ricardo.
Where are we going to meet?
We need to consider all options.
I hope this never happens again.
It's a great probability that tomorrow's raining.
You're driving me crazy.
You don't need my permission.
I remember everything.
Do you think what she said was a lie?
Tom didn't do that.
He's got a nice flower, but he doesn't produce fruit.
I'm touched.
Tom told me to knock on the door.
Tom's fired.
Do you plan to go to Tom's and Mary's wedding?
This candidate is significantly better than his precedent.
Don't call me while I'm in the office.
Who bought you this?
Thank you for loving me.
The doctor's interrogating the patient.
Tom put his drinks down.
It's a lyrics of justice.

Are you angry about that?
I baked my tongue.
You tried.
I thought I could trust Tom.
Zine!
When there's no news, that's good news.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Did that come up with me?
No one died.
Did you sleep?
I'm deaf and I'm not eating.
They've been judging hard in court.
My name is Sally.
I'm not practicing.
Is there a reason why you're keeping these old bottles?
We've been talking for a while.
Now I have to go.
Can I take your dictionary?
No one else was hurt.
We have to try.
That fabric isn't from India, is it?
Who are you?
I'll buy what I need tomorrow.
Maybe I'm anti-social, but that doesn't mean I'm not talking to people.
I believe you're honest.
I didn't choose anything.
Don't yell at me.
They were talking ugly about the captain while he was gone.
Let's try something.
Are you in Paris?
Don't leave me alone.
Tom started learning French last year.

Tom's new girlfriend is very young.
I don't understand that word.
I hope Tom will remember this.

I'm sick of your screaming.
I've never noticed that before.
Do you want to live in Mumbai?
Maria's a book mole.

I'm too old for something like this.
Tell me where you live.
You have to teach me these days.
Yeah.
I love this store.
I'm just about to go looking for you.
He's leading a hard life.
I'm not a rich man.
I really like your music.
I lost my mind's stream.
That's what I'm used to.
Tom's got the right attitude.
The anatomic breast implants, however, can also lead to the deformation of breast forms if they rotate on the side.
Where did you find the keys?
I'm not gonna tell anyone you did it.
She tried.
Tom was a little freaked out.
I saw the bus.
It's not a big deal.
Tom's wise enough to do something like that.
I brought these reports to see them more closely.
I'm not as rich as we would like.
Can I kiss you?
Get on the board.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.
Tom's still mad.
How can I know you're not going to report me after helping you?
Why are you still awake?
Please don't make me eat that.
I think your work is very good.
Tom helped Mary wear a coat.
Have fun while you can.

He was born in a small town in Italy.
What did you two do?

I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
Okay, we have a deal.

I'm buying a lot of stuff in that store.

Give me milk.
I just want to go home.
Tom's upset about this.
Have you seen my dogs?
I have a book.
What are your kids usually breakfast?
Am I so different?
We had a terrible fight.
In this stage of world history, in America there is no such thing as an independent press. You know that and I know that. Among you, there is no one who dares to write his sincere opinion, and if anyone of you would write it in advance would know that it will never appear in the press. I've received my regular pay to keep my honest opinion outside the newspaper I'm working for. Many of you are also paid for similar things, and any of you who would be so crazy to write what you honestly think would find out outside, on the street, looking for some other work. That I'd let my right opinion appear only in one edition of the newspaper for which I work, I'd get a quiz from work in less than 24 hours....
Tom's a salesman, too.
I'm double older than Tom.
That's exactly what I said would happen.

Don't argue with me!

You disappointed me.

Tom doesn't want you to share this information with anyone.
We all have received a blessing for the blessing of the Almighty of Her Grace.
No matter how much I'm considering, I still don't understand.
Tom's thinking the same thing.
Tom has no brothers or sisters.
Like in good old times.
I never borrow books or CDs to anyone.
That was kind of weird.
I don't have much friends.
I have something to drink.
My children rely on me.
I beg you to think about it again.
It can be treated.
We're here tonight for a good reason.
Don't bother.
When they experienced the French revolution, citizens became free people, free traditions and churches, praised freedom, equality and brotherhood.
I thought it wasn't appropriate.
Tom offered to help when it seemed that everything went completely wrong.
Tom left before I arrived.
It's not allowed to smoke here.
Translate it or not is a moral choice of translators, and sometimes things sound better if they remain such as they are in the language in which they are created.
Look at what I grew up!
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
It's necessary.
What did you do now?
Excuses on errors.
I'm poor.
How long have you been living here?
Do you think the situation will improve?
Who doesn't risk, doesn't win.
Don't look.
J. Kepler, astronomer and mathematician, was doing research on planets and their movements.
That's enough for today.
That was very good.
I've never been to camping.
Bury Kalifa is the highest cloud in the world today.
I wasn't exactly ready.
It's very old books.
I could help.
Tom shouldn't eat if he doesn't want to.
It's a time competition.
Please go.
She's been caught at work.
I think I know a way to save for a while.
You told me you wouldn't be here today.
That was unfair.
You don't know me.
It's a totally unique friendship that's been deepening for many years.
Okay, I get it.
What are you looking for?
Are we all here?
Scientists believe that finding always comes like a thunder from the wind of the sky.
Oh, no!
It's not that easy.
Is that your new boyfriend?
The ship's screwed up.
I got a new bike for my birthday.
I said I'd wait for you.
I agreed to buy it.
Happy birthday!
It came from nowhere.
They know you.
Let's go one at a time.
Don't yell.
The ship disappeared without a lead.
I got off the train.
They won.
It's precise.
I've never seen that before.
Have you enjoyed watching the night game last night?
Their closeness was mysterious, since they only met three days ago.
We only speak French at home.
I've done that before.
What year was your car made?
I was trying to be nice.
Don't sing.
It would be good if I dressed another layer.
What am I saying, brother?
The keys are in the code.
That's all we can do.
Is that your new shoes?
What's the name?
Why don't you take your coat off?
Where the hell have you been before?
She was smiling.
You told me you wouldn't be here today.
Tom's gone.
Tom just couldn't do that.
I thought you were married.
I'll go if you go.
Are you on Facebook?
All right, what about you?
Well, I have some news.
The chances were against me.
I want to be with her.
What I saw was embarrassing.
Did you tell Tom that Mary did this?
You tried.
Thank you for loving me.
I'm a big football fan.
We'll do what we always do.
You're making Tom nervous.
Knowing is nothing, imagination is all.
Keep working.
There's a lot of bad people in the world.
It all happened with lightning speed.
I thought you were happy here.
I'm natural.
I don't feel like dancing.
Don't forget to send this letter.
Nothing happens if he doesn't have a dream.
This book isn't about linguistics.
I was trying to be nice.
I can't believe my eyes.
Are you a student?
It's her, isn't it?
I promise, I won't lie to you anymore.
The mini skirts are back in fashion.
Tell him I'm innocent.
Tom is very well imitating the way Mary speaks.
Can you solve this problem?
Can you go faster?
Some of my friends smoke.
You're my princess.
You'll miss everything.
Come on, sit down.
Tom's gonna wait.
Looks like Tom thinks so.
Don't let Tommy sleep.
Come down here.
This place is really beautiful.
Excuse me?
Everyone's changing.
Who's going to be the first?
I'm a translator.
The church is just across the street.
Would you like more apple juice?
We can't lose hope.
Let's sit down.
My father always said the heavens help those who help themselves.
Buy a liter of milk, and if they have eggs, buy twelve eggs.
Tom wants to know if you're planning to come to his party.
Did you see me dance?
Why would Tom want that?
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
Be real!
Tom's very idiotic.
I'm hurt.
Keep digging.
I don't want any evil.
I was the only man in the tourist group, the rest of them were the Arabs living in Istanbul.

We need to get better.
They demanded an increase in salary.
Let me see your recipe.
Tom came to help.
Sometimes they seem to seem to have a family spread through generations.
It's all wrong with him.
Tom thinks fast.
Comments must be about the subject.
Don't get out of here.
The programme sets the conditions for the development and implementation of projects.
We need to get going again.
Do you feel okay today?
We won.
Give me the spoon.
Can I find you on Face?
I was trying to be kind.
What was the name of the Boston hotel you were in last year?
I had lunch with her.
It would be confusing.
Tom introduced himself.
We're here.
It's their book.
Tom, we have a problem.
You can sit next to me.
That pulled the hand.
Tom was a great manager.
Everybody taps.
All you need to do is practice.

She's walking.
Why are you still awake?
Tom was a scout.
You'll be completely safe.
What are we doing with this mess?
You can lose today and win tomorrow.
Tom counted the remnant.
I was studying hard while I was at school.
I refused the Tom.
Should we tell someone?
After five hours on the hot sand, he saw something on the horizon that looked like a desert fatamorgan.
When are you coming to the station?
Are you honest?
We'll try in your way.
Snow falls.
Are you a maniac?
Gold is more expensive than iron.
I'll be better now.
And that's it!
I made an apple pie.
Are you a prisoner?
No one's watched.
If you have to be somewhere right now, it's definitely here!
Tom could lie.
Good luck.
I've never repented for that.
Tom was mad as a ris.
Tom could have a point.
Am I welcome here?
I don't know what Tom was thinking.
What did you both do?
Don't yell.
What a experience!
Tom's learning to program.
Are we done?
How much does that cost?
Tom's a little eccentric.
Tom's the best singer in my class.
Mary came back from school in tears because her friends were kidding her.
I trusted you my secret and you betrayed me.
I'm writing very fast.
We all did that.
Maybe you're wrong.
I'm sure you'll understand.
I have to pay my debt.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
His speech was, mildly said, a catastrophe.
I'm worried about you.
We have to save money to buy a new car.
What are you going to write in this letter?
Bad things will happen.
I thought you already took care of it.
What year is your car?
You have to believe it's possible that it's going to change.
She translated her sentence.
Did you ever ask Tom to use it?
This book is dry.
She came alone.
Have love, not war!
I could go there now.
Everyone was cheering.
Tom said you were cool.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'm glad you answered.
Drive carefully.

Turn left.
Be careful.

You understand me.

I think you should talk to Tom about it.
Rest in peace!
Tom arrived in time despite the storm.
Something wasn't right.
Tom said I was unkind.
Tom wanted to get Mary's phone number, but she refused to give it to him.
I'm beaching someone to do it for me.

It's not bad.
He asked me to help him.
It's so hot here.
Have you completely recovered?
Dan learned the Slovenian languages of all Eastern Europe that he visited.
Tom was wearing black farmers and a white shirt.

You're driving slowly.
Mary's Tom's sister is a twin.
Tom must have had the key.
Time in Istanbul is very cold.
Why is that interesting?

I'm sure Tom didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
Life is beautiful.
You're the reason I'm here for.
Tom probably hates me, too.
Tom spent the whole afternoon playing tennis.
You can sit with me.
Oh, gray cats, please don't pass.
I'll be glad to come.
Just give me a chance.
Tom asked Mary some questions she couldn't answer.
I saw the cat.
What makes you smile?
How many people were there?
Everyone's quiet.
Send me some sugar, please.
I'm amazed.
I want the sword!
It seems too good to be true.
Don't talk.
Excellent!

You're average students.
Tom's as old as Mary.
The lemon is sour.
Why don't you come by sometime?
We all did that.
I'm drinking milk.
What have you done now?
This is the bag I bought in Italy.
Answer me now.
Why are you mad at me?
Don't forget we should do our homework.
It would be nice to wait for me.
They were sitting in the circle.
I want to meet Tom.
We've arrived in time.
I'm sorry.

You underestimate me.
Tell me what you wrote.

He gave up.
Do you like it or not?
Life continues!

I'm not that happy.
Anybody want a beer?

Goodbye!
You're good to everyone.
Come see me after work.
Where's the beach?
How do I call a cab?
Where are our rains?

Open up.

The facial is easy enough to float on the water.
When you start, you'll never stop.
That's really nice.
I can't either.

Do you like rollers?
If it's not okay, it's not the end.
I'm angry.
Follow him.
Move, people.
Are you sarcastic?
I'm really sorry, Tom.
Where did you find this knife?
Speak for yourself, Tom.

We haven't met yet.
I'm not old.

Tom himself ate the whole box of chocolate.
Keep the remnant.
Can we do this later?

The truth must be said.
Wash yourself.
Do you like costumes?
Didn't you do enough?
What do you know about me?
I think he's very smart with that.
We have two daughters and two sons.
Does that mean you love me?
This will never end.
We have a serious problem.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Explain it in simple words.
In our monogamous part of the world, marrying means semi-pooling your rights and doubleing your obligations.
Tom just drinks coffee without caffeine.
There's a cat in the kitchen.

I'm learning a few languages.
The mayor personally delivered the rewards.
When you hurt others, you hurt yourself.
I'd do the same again without thinking.

Who else uses this room?
You'll save time if you listen carefully to my instructions.
Do you have any idea of my life?
He's tired of reading.
Can we order now?
The code is Muriel.
We can't stop here.
Tom didn't think for a moment he was trying to convince Mary to do that.
Don't argue with me.
Hey, give me a chance.
There is also an ethical question that has been asked about this.
It just happened again.
Everyone survived.
It'll happen bad things.
Several people were killed.
Who's that crazy guy?
Do you love your mother?
He's a complete monarch.
Who is this man?
I'm really proud of it.
This is my third marriage.
What did you do here?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom's a little worried.
He likes to make a goat ass.
I'm totally disagree with that.
The boy's thin.
It's a routine thing.
He never overcome his son's death.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will anyone tell me what to do?
Tom writes better than I do.
I don't have anything on my hand today.
I'm responsible.
You're doing good.
That's what Tom tells me.
Tom pressed the switch.
I need my children.
The teacher wrote something on the board, but I couldn't read because it was too little.
Of course, Tom's wrong.
I didn't wash my hair.
I can close my eyes.
He's got to buy his son a new bike.
My dear, don't be shy!
Are you afraid of death?
Are you hungry?
Tom's still frustrated.
If you try, you'll make it.
We have enough seats for everyone.
That was a fake alarm.
Tom's learning programming.
Everybody can get the waxes.
Tom didn't let me answer Mary's question.
What did you answer?
I don't know the answer.
Every time I find something I like, it's always too expensive.
It's a cat.
This advertisement is very insulting.
I want Tom to go by noon.
Tom seemed amazed.
Tom wasn't very energy.
Nancy's afraid of dogs.
It won't help you if you're worried.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
Did you go see Tom?
I was looking for you.
The cat is not a man!
So this is how it ends?
What's this?
I'll go with the car.
Tom likes to write.
Tom didn't know which question to ask.
I'm just doing my duty.
He's asleep like a baby.
I'm taking a day off.
Are you blaming me?
That's not what I like.
That ruined the mood at the table yesterday.
Stay in the house.
I thought you were going to Boston bus.
Tom still has a little time.
Fuck you!
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
Just waste your time.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
How many pairs do you have?

Man has a lot of desires that he doesn't really want to be achieved, and it would be wrong to assume the opposite.He wants them to remain only wishes; they have value only in his imagination; their accomplishment would be a bitter disappointment for him. That's one wish and a desire for everlasting life. If it was fulfilled, a man would become completely sick of infinite life, and would want death.
