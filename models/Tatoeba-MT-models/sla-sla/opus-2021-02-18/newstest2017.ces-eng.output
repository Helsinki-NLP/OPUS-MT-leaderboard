The Czech roads invested in the modernisation of vehicles over 31 billion.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the past six years, he invested a national carrier in modernization of vehicles over 31 billion crowns.
A third of the vehicles are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half the trains have a new closed toilet system.
However, the amounts for modernisation in individual years, except for 2012, are gradually declined.
The Czech roads have invested over 31 billion crowns in the past six years.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half the trains have a new closed toilet system.
The money earned to reduce the average age by two years in locomotives and separate units and by six years in classic vagons.
A larger share of investments has given the carrier to the regional transport, where nearly 60 per cent of those money were headed, and 40 per cent have invested in the renewal of vehicles for remote transport.
The average age of locomotive and units currently reaches 19 years.
However, modernised older vehicles are counted as new in this indicator.
If the modernisation of vehicles were not calculated, the average age of CHD movements would increase by ten years.
Some of the elders are in the average of personal vagons whose average age is 23 years old when the modernisation is started.
If only ages were taken into account from the date of production, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
Classic cars composed of vagons and pulled by locomotive, however, in recent years from the Czech and global railways gradually disappear and are replaced by motor or electrical units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the locomotive from 280 to 223 pieces fell similarly from 2716 classic vagons in 2011 to 2132 in the mid-year year.
The carrier was especially riding of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the ride.
From January to July, he let the carrier crush 110 of these cars.
For example, from the investments to the vehicle park planned to make in the near future, 50 vagons for speed up to 200 km in an hour that the carrier plans to put on the international line of Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electrical units for local rapid tracks.
The Treaty counts up to 30 motor pieces and 20 pieces of electrical units.
The officials know about illegal ads for four years, they can't get rid of it.
We're completely powerless, they admit.
It's been about a quarter of the editing of the online journal Currently.cz watches the story of the billboard in the south Czech Republic, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipna, where there is not only a touristly interesting walk in tree crowns, but also the Olympic Park.
The road managers know they're standing black there, but they say they can't do anything about it.
Similar advertisings are hundreds, perhaps thousands around the country.
According to officials, there is a charity law that makes illegal mobile billboards impossible to be removed immediately.
It needs a complex bureaucratic wheel first.
Meanwhile, the company will change its name and the office is short to it.
Or it's enough to move the advertisement by a few meters and the official process must start again.
The Road and Highway Manager admitted fourth year ago: the main move from the Czech Budjejevic to Lipno stands on our land at the state road of the advertising billboard black.
Even for three months, the officials were not enough to get rid of the unauthorized transmission structures with a giant advertising poster.
It's like no one's got a problem standing right next to the cart, in a 50-meter security zone where nothing can be worth for security.
The road managers claim that the billboard for the hole law can't easily handle it.
It's like loading him and taking him away.
"We can't just afford that," says the speaker of the Driver and Highway Management Nina Ledvin and refers to a complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must be prevented according to the law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate has started online journal Currently.cz to closely monitor the spring, while it is not unique and indicates the general problem that the state and authorities can't deal effectively and quickly.
Only in the southern Czech Republic, the edition counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules directly next to the cart or nearby.
Similarly, there are other areas.
"We have trouble to force firms to remove liaisons," confirms the chief of the Czech-Buddey district office of Jir Klas, whose colleagues are dealing with similar stories.
According to the class, there is a hole law that connects officials.
First of all, he has to address the owner of the billboard to give the advertisement away.
But the boss companies are often unacceptable or they know the finth that is already Currently.cz in the past described when more detailed concerns about the problem: enough mobile stand with advertising to move a few meters and officials can throw the previous call to remove the black advertisement into the basket.
That's because the office has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and coordinates suddenly disagree, they take it as a new installation and we have to address the owners again," explains Jiri Klasa.
The new law won't help.
The change could have been made by a new law that will ban billboards on roads from September of the next year and limit them to the roads of the I. Class.
The criticists point out that rules for overthrowing illegal and easily transmitted advertising will remain the same as yet.
And it won't relieve the authorities.
Firms can still make dozens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year on rentals of illegal areas and no one can make them.
For example, the billboard attracting Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
The officials are well aware of it: the Czechobuditean master is currently running three administrative procedures for blackly built billboards.
The company is threatened in every management of 300,000 penalties.
These are more advertisings that were placed in the protective zone of the I. Class.
Drives are not finished yet, says Jaroslav Mraz, head of the Transport Board of the Czech-Buddy Mastership.
The advertising, with no interest in Currently.ch, is not yet figured between these cases, soon but with the greatest probability it will come to them.
According to the spokesman, Nina Ledvin's company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, so the case will be reached by the district desk and then probably by magistrate officials.
Commerz Billboard belongs to those suspects who can't contact.
She doesn't take the mail and the official seat on Zižkov has cancelled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind her.
In the past, she attended the South Czech entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who had a sharp dispute with the Czech head of the Hyundai mark.
Fischer, whose EuroBillboard area is renting and offering them to the shareholders, but in the past he rejected any connection.
In the spring this year, when the RSD started to invoke Currently.Ch to interest in the Lipno advertisement, Fischer left the public officials to send a letter for the mysterious Commerz Billboard to their pension, where the new company is allegedly sitting.
Even from this address, no one has contacted the train managers today.
It's a vain fight.
Similar silence or untransparent changes in the site are not unusual.
One company has gradually been punished for two million crowns a few years ago.
But she changed her name and ICHO, and there was nothing to deal with.
The executor's case returned, the advertising continued, maybe elsewhere.
We are quite powerless against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, acknowledging anonymity by one of the officials.
None of the laws in this regard are yet solved.
Currently.We have spoken to several Members who have been involved in the problem.
But they haven't developed any activity yet.
On the contrary, messengers appeared who wanted to extend the term for the maintenance of billboards in the main Czech communications.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only for national, but also regional and general policies very sensitive and somewhat schizofren topics.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their restrictions, but on the other hand, they need them for advertising in pre-electoral campaigns.
I don't stop the relatively imposed impression that if something doesn't work, it's necessary to change laws.
Agricultures will take less grains this year, but more rapes and maka, they estimate statistics.
According to the estimates of the Czech Statistics Office, the harvest of cereals this year will be 6.7 per cent lower than last year.
However, this year's fertility exceeds the average in the last five and ten years.
The higher will be the rape harvest (by 3.9 per cent) and the mack (2.5 per cent).
The harvest of cereals this year will be 6.7% lower than last year.
Agriculturals have 7,2 million tonnes of grain.
This comes from the estimates published by the Czech Statistics Authority by July 15.
The initial estimate was more pessimistic month ago and assumed a tenth decline against last month.
Last year, the harvest of cereals was super average.
This year's fertility exceeds the average in the last five and ten years.
On the contrary, it will be higher this year's harvest of rape and maka.
The peasants will scrap up by 3.9 percent more than a year ago when they received 1.256 million tonnes under the roof.
This year's fertility of maka could be 2.5% higher than last year.
The estimated decline in the production of cereals is caused by both decrease in hectare income by 3.7 per cent to 5.71 tonnes of hectare, as well as the decline of the seed area.
The farmers had three percent less fields this year.
The wheat of wheat, which is the most important cereal for Czech Republic, is estimated to be less than 3.3% this year.
The farmers put her out on more fields.
However, lower hectare receipt will be signed on the decline, which falls to 6.04 tonnes.
Approximately fiveth decline statistics assume in spring barley, which is most commonly used to produce beer.
The decline in yield is a 15.2% reduction in seed area but also lower hectare profit.
The egg of the winter will be born by 6.3 per cent more.
The harvest of grain will also grow.
The fertility is estimated by 1,305 million tonnes, which is more against last year.
The seeds have expanded by 7.3 per cent.
But hectare profit will be 3.2% lower than last year.
This year's fertility of rape exceeds the ten-year average by 13.3 per cent, and is seated on the surface by a third of the larger than ten years ago.
In the last four years, we also have a mack field.
This year, the farmers expelled him to 35,543 hectares.
Against 2008, when the mack in Czech Republic was grown on the records of 70,000 hectares, there is half the field.
By expanding the seed area, this year's harvest will be richer.
It's going to go against last year by 2.5% to 27,423 tonnes.
But hectare yield will be 6.1 per cent lower.
The cops charged two men with a knife and a machete, and the court sent them to custody.
The police accused two assaulters who attacked a 50-year-old man on Tuesday in the center of Olomouca with a knife and a mačeta.
"Although the attacked tried to escape, they caused him urinary and cutting injuries that demanded treatment in the hospital and other treatment," said police speaker Maria Strabáková.
Both obvious perpetrators were arrested immediately after the attack.
The prosecutor filed a proposal to the court on their detention and the court accepted it on Friday.
Both men are in danger of three to ten years of prison.
Police officers charged two arrested for the attack of a fifty-year-old man in the center of Olomouce with knife and machete.
The attackers caused him urine and cutting injuries, the man ended up in the hospital.
Attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people that took place on Tuesday on the right afternoon at the Freedom class, stated by the police.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, informed the Olomouc police spokesman Marie Strbák.
A bunch of fights between the two families took place in the garden area outside the Tratoria bar in the immediate vicinity of the Olomouce center.
After an aggressive vocabulary, two attackers attacked by the knife and the machete of a fifty - fifty - year - old man.
Although the attacked man tried to escape, they caused him urine and cutting injuries that demanded treatment in the hospital and other treatments, the police speaker said.
In a struggle that raised great attention in the center of the city and which had to be involved in several police patrols and officers, it was a family dispute.
Criminalists of a 40 - year - old man from Slovakia and a 70 - year - old man in Olomouca accused them of attempting to severely hurt the health and exploitation.
The prosecutor filed a proposal from the court to imprison them and the court accepted it on Friday, complemented by the speaker.
The mačeta was used in the center of Olomouca in a massive battle, as well as five years ago, only a few dozen metres away, before the Discotch of Varna in Riegrova Street.
At that time, the police said that about ten foreigners attacked the guests of the company standing in front of the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished two attackers of a foreigner in terms of conditional punishment.
Leaved and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you're walking around them every day.
One of the most screaming examples of the unused and empty house is the widest building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of the Sennate Square.
She was supposed to work like a hotel a long time ago.
But it's still nothing.
That you need to build new apartments and offices in the metropolitan?
What about the existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the center of Prague, in the immediate area of the Václava Square, there are several houses that, despite their position, size and often memorial protection, are only empty and empty.
We have chosen properties in the centre using the Holiday.cz project, which maps long-term empty properties in the territory of Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, intravenous relations between companies or belong to a state that cannot or refuse to get rid of them.
There's more than homeless houses in Czech Republic.
Let the owners pay special taxes for them, the initiative wants

Clinton's husbands made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to publish his tax confession.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, expression Bill Clinton, earned $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars were dedicated to Clinton's charity.
The majority of Clinton's income -- over six million dollars -- is for their speeches.
Trump his tax confession refuses to publish.
The US Democrat candidate to the Presidential Office of Hillary Clinton published its tax reports on Friday, boosting pressure on her Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, expression Bill Clinton, earned $10.6 million last year, announced the AP agency.
The majority of Clinton's income -- over six million dollars -- is for their speeches, mostly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton started her campaign before the elections.
The tax report showed that Clinton's husbands took a federal tax from the income of 34.2 per cent last year and then a tax from state and local income at nine per cent.
Therefore, they paid total taxes for 43.2 per cent of the income.
Trump, however, has a problem with a similar step, yet has not decided to publish tax confession.
There is a certain possibility that Donald Trump does not pay any taxes at all, wrote Clinton on Twitter a few minutes after the publication of her confession.
Clinton repeatedly returns to the secrecy around Trump's income, including to raise doubts whether her rival is as rich as it claims, the AP said.
Trump's wealth is estimated to be billions of dollars.
The lower earnings would harm the reputation of the Republican candidate as a successful entrepreneur.
Senator Tim Kaine, who candidates for a vice president in the Tandem with his former first lady, has published a report on his tax deductions in the past ten years.
Together with their wife, Anne Holton, they gave 7.5 percent of their goods to charity and took 25.6% of their salaries on taxes last year.
In Nigeria, the vertebrae has broken again.
The Islamist from Boko Haram prevented a consistent vaccination and killed the doctors.
In Nigeria, child defence cases have been reappointed.
In the northeast of the country, the government declared extraordinary vaccines, since there were two children infected with this disease.
The vaccines transported helicopters there.
In the affected area, islamist terrorists in Boko Haram, who defended vaccines and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was circled there unspecifically.
In the northeast of Nigeria, extraordinary vaccination of children against the armor, because there are two children infected with this disease.
In Africa, the defense was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government announced that there will be a million children in Borno and another four million in the surrounding states.
The Nigerian military helicopters on Friday, according to the AP Agency, quickly transported vaccines against the child's armor to the affected north-eastern part of the country where islamist terrorists act from Boko Haram.
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the virus in the area has been collapsed for many years.
The extremists from Boko Haram in the past defended vaccination and even killed the doctors.
Their attacks also disabled doctors on Thursday to get into areas where children with branches were found.
Both infected pattolate came from refugees from the part of Nigeria newly released from Boko Haram.
The director of the WHO section responsible for the elimination of the defence of Michel Zaffran BBC station said that the vaccination in Nigeria will begin next week.
In the state of Borno, the Islamic radical group Boko Haram had been involved for a long time.
The area was accessible to international organisations and governments until the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram was able to weaken in this part of the country in a substantial way.
The Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adevole admitted that the new cases of defence are great disappointment for the country because Nigeria wanted to announce that the defence was removed next year.
WHO noted that it was possible that although the disease has not occurred for two years, it was spreading among the children.
The children will now be expected in the age of five years.
In 2012, half of the world's defence cases were in Nigeria.
While the defence was still in 125 countries in 1988, it is now only in three areas - in Afghanistan and Pakistan and in northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He's listening to the prompted stories of fallen women.
Pope František met with twenty former prostitutes who fled the band of passers through the police.
The Pope heard their hard life stories and called them to look in the future with confidence.
Francesec wanted to note this meeting of trafficking with people and call for strengthening the fight against him.
Pope Francisek met with twenty former prostitutes in Rome whom the police freed from the power of the band of passers.
The head of the Catholic Church listened to more than an hour of provoked stories of falling women, and then called them to look to the future with confidence, said the speaker of Vatican.
Among the former prostitutes František visited were six women from Romania, four Albania, seven from Nigeria and one of Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age moves around 30.
All of them, according to Vatican, were exposed to cruel physical violence during forced prostitution.
In visit, Francisek wanted to pay attention to trafficking with people and call for strengthening the fight against him, said the Pope's speaker.
Francesec often mentions the fate of people on the edge of society.
For example, on Thursday he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived to Vatican this year in April and June thanks to his personal invitation.
France will strike the production of hygadists.
Without the help of the Muslims, it won't work.
France has helped the Muslims themselves in the fight against radical Islamic.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Vallsa is preparing major changes in the functioning of meshites and spiritual education.
Since December last, we closed 20 meshites and prayers.
And the next will follow, the Minister of Interior announced.
In the country, there are over a hundred producers of gyhadists.
"If the Muslims do not help the State in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult to guarantee France with this confession of freedom," Prime Minister Manuel Vals said.
In particular, it is intended to preach in the meshites and prayers only the owners who were educated in France.
At the same time, he wants to stop the funding of abroad mess.
At the moment, about 20 percent of the money comes from a foreign country to build new messies, most from Morocco, Algeria and the countries of the Persian Gulf.
And that is why the preachers can see radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," the Prime Minister added.
The new French Islamic Foundation will be the key to the fulfillment of these goals.
It should work as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
The French Fund for Islam now operates in the country, which was established by the Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
In that time, the foundation had to contribute to the transparency of financial flows between meshites and countries that funded their construction.
But the institution soon hit internal disputes and rivalry.
"It's a total failure," said Valls recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, the debate on a new institution that will replace the non-functional foundation.
All the other terrorist attacks in France, which in the name of the Islamic State, have been expedited by traditional Islamists.
The French Minister of Interior, Bernard Cazeneuve, recently heard that the new foundation would be created in October this year.
He will have two main tasks - to ensure the funding of the meats from domestic resources, and also to supervise the property.
So far, it is not clear where he will take money not only for building new bags but also for various educational centres.
However, several proposals are considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax on food hall.
This would be paid in practice by the sellers for granting certification.
A part of this money would travel to the fund's cash.
The contribution of 10 to 20 euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by the French travellers who go to Mekka.
Every year, there are about 30,000 travelling to Saudi Arabia.
And not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, only preachers who went through special educational programmes in the French universities should work in the future.
This should ensure that the preaching is in line with democracy.
We'll close the radical bags.
The French government is at the same time in pursuit against radicals.
And the next will follow, the Minister of Interior recently announced.
There is no place in France for those who report hatred and disrespect certain principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
It is estimated that about 2500 meshites and prayers operate in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamicism.
Since 2012, the authorities have posted approximately 80 propertys and consider it in several other dozens.
But not everyone thinks that government steps can significantly affect radicalism.
Those who want to be radicalized will do the same thing.
Because this is not happening in the meshits, young people are radicalized on the Internet, said Northine Labatová, expert from the National Centre for Scientific Research.
The dear Keleman lost in the first sprint round with the Baugem star.
The Czech Road Road Cyclist must kill the process to the 8-final.
The Road Cyclerist Paul Kelemen at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro after the qualification of the sprint between the best eighteen in the first round of the fight with the French giant Gregory Baugem, a silver defender of previous games in London.
The process to the 8-final must be murdered in the corrective drives.
At the start of the Royal Disciplination on the road, 27 riders were set up and the best Czech Roadman of the present gave his fourteenth best time.
He arrived in 9,969 seconds.
In the main phase of exhaustion, Baugé was waiting for him in the qualification of the Fifth, who already had bronz from Ria in the team sprint.
Although Kelemen concluded with the experienced French, he took care of the procedure.
A great performance shineed by the gold defender Jason Kenny.
Eighty-five-year-old British took the third fastest 200 of history and qualification won in the Olympic record 9.551.
Then he was eager to deal with the last progressive German Maximilian Levy.
The British Quartet also managed with Bradley Wiggins, which in a 4 km race, took a new world record of 3:50.570 and went to the final.
The maximum (3:51.659), which belonged to the British for four years since the Olympiad in London, has improved more than a second.
Young doctors push: They want fresh wind in the field
The representatives of young doctors gathered to approve new steps in their arguing about the new treaty.
The Council of Young Doctors (JDC) in the British Medical Association (BMA) must request the entire Council to support other business actions from the beginning of September.
The JDC says the ministers have failed to solve the issues of the contract.
Young doctors and students of medicine voted in July for the refusal of the contract agreed with BMA.
58 % of its members who participated in the elections were rejected.
In a letter to the members published on Thursday night on Twitter, JDC Ellen McCourt stated that the government remained “continuing silence” to the questions, which is a volunteer to reject the contract.
She said: “In this light, the JDC executive authority decided by vote to reject the proposed new contract completely and request new formal acts in all matters.”
In response to the silence of the government today, the JDC Executive Board formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve the running programme of threats to business activities from the beginning of September.
This year, the dispute led young doctors to announce to six strikes, including the first general stakes in the NHS history.
The Leader of Young Medicines in BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed conditions of the contract, which BMA recommended.
The members of BMA at the meeting before the vote of 54,000 young doctors and students of medicine said that the agreement was good and should be adopted.
After the voting, the Minister of Health said that the treaty would be a burden for the medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: The Unitedation of "Incompatible"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and notify the formal end of eight months of long word war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterparty in the precious hall of the palace in Petrohrad, I had the impression that Ankara wanted more for this reconciliation.
There's been a hand hand-supplier, yes.
But Putin did not laugh, and heat was barely lighting from him, even according to his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the contrary, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Mr. Putin - five times, as one of the reports reports.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to its level before the crisis, but will be even better.
Another day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan was acting like nothing wrong ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm exposed the contrary.
But the lasting cold that blew out of Putin showed that the Russian leader did not forget anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: the destruction of the Russian fighting plane by Turkey at the Syrian borders.
Moscow's reaction was angry at that time.
Putin was sharing the wounds around him, and Ankara accused Moscow of hitting a knife in the back.
The distress was bigger that it came from a suspected friend.
Rebuilding true trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
A massive universal campaign against Ankara led by the state-controlled media after a month.
Suddenly it seemed like Turks could have done anything.
More serious was the charges of high-state officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in the parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denyed this very much.
But there was an official message in Petrohrad that it was time to move on.
Finally, this meeting happened only because Putin received an apology he asked for from President Erdogan.
Russia could have announced some victory, too.
For Ankara, the benefits of the release of the premises are clear.
First of all, Erdogan was almost freed from power last month, so he needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey also appear to have shaken them.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have had a severe impact -- especially the cancellation of charter flights, which will transport several million Russian tourists annually to the coast of Turkey.
This number decreased almost by 90%.
With regard to Russia, operators and charter companies will actually breathe here when there are flights.
They earn on the Mediterranean travel movement at the end of the season.
Even this week, the state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when imports of agricultural products from Turkey were allowed again.
"Turists there, tomatoes back here," as the report reported in the Witness newspaper.
However, the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is mad at the West for what she considers to be a chabo response to an attempt to turn.
Furthermore, long-term immortality long-term talks on EU entry and entering Putina - which is eager to use the cooling and to break Turkey's links with the West.
The Russian leader has certainly received bonus points when Ankara asked him to help the chosen authorities after attempting the puch.
You must understand that for Moscow, which has deeply rooted fear of the change in the regime, it is given.
So the summit in this pompessional, direct palace of Russia and Turkey allowed me to show what one of the analysts described to me as "the uncompatible association," as the forces of two countries that feel to be rejected and used by the West.
However, despite showing public mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between these two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow has recently become a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey stand on the opposite sides.
After nearly three-hour opening talks, both presidents at the press conference noted that they had not even mentioned this question.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answers to the question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to raise these differences.
There is no clear agreement on which both States could find a common speech in Syria's question.
But after months of open enemy - and given the risk of a total disaster, when NATO member of Turkey destroyed a Russian fighting plane - it is certainly better for both leaders to speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the executive director of the bank, the RBS mark should be put in the role of the back office.
Royal Bank of Scotland is lost for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland station that the RBS mark was linked to the global ambitions of the bank.
She leaked from them when she nearly disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At that time, the strategy marks used “RBS” to protect other consumer finance marks.
It was worth millions of pounds issued for sponsoring international sports, from the Six Nations football championship to Winbledom Andy Marray.
But now it was decided that it was better to give more to national marks.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scottish customers, but will not start new shops.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, except the centres and the code of stocks on the market, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank mark is already used for customers in the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller signs for private banking that will get more forward - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During the journey to customers and employees in Inverness-shire McEwan answered the questions of Ross McEwan.
The BBC Station said: “The RBS mark will stop being our investment mark and the mark for which our employees are working, because we are now much more a bank of marks.”
Because the bank itself became a global mark, it became a global mark as well as RBS.
Now I'm saying that we don't have global aspirations anymore, we have efforts focused on the home scene.
Each of these marks will mean something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work under these marks.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations championship, prepared a profile of individual sport sponsorship marks.
"There is a good time for us to move to the bank of marks, because the basic question (which we ask) is how to focus on being a better customer bank?", stated the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would be very cynical if we said we'd become a great bank for customers and they'd represent those marks.
But along with how we focused on the needs of customers, not on our own, I think there are a lot of changes.
We can remind these marks again, I think it's the right time.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on the horse Prelection led to target 3000. winner.
Dettori is shaking champagne after double winning in Newmarket brought him 3000 victories.
Jokey Frankie Dettori secured the 3000th victory in Britain in Newmarket on Friday.
This lover reached his second victory tonight on his local track - on the horse of Prelection, which is trained by John Gosden.
Fifty-five-five-year-old Italy is the sixth jocques that achieved such a result in equity.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-fold champion of Dettori, who won the Ghayyar horse, said, "It's strange."
I'm very touched because my family is here too.
I'm very glad that this happened in Newmarket, because right here I've got 30 years ago.
It's not a huge action, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I was relieved, and I am very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when after victory brings Preilection
Two jokes of this milestone have achieved the obstacle - the champion of Richard Johnson and the 20-fold champion of Sir Anthony McCoy pension, who during his career broke records to the target of more than 4.300 winners.
Lester Piggott, nine times Derby winner, 4 493 winners in career
Frankie is one of the best jokeys in modern times and is not surprised that he has reached a minor who had only reached a few riders before him.
He's styled and strong, but it's just his tactical fistrone that distinguishes him from the other riders in seriousness.
He's a fantastic ambassador of reaches, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he hadn't only traveled on weekends and great gains, he'd have already got 6,000 winners!
Of course, the truth is that Frankie was driving a winner in Great Britain for most of his 30-year-old career, and that's really something.
It's a living nature, which is good for British athletic sports, but more important is that he's an incredible joke.
Frankie Dettori has celebrated his reputational summer jump
From the flying Finishes to the summer jumps - Frankie Dettori was a shipper of British equity achievements for two decades.
It was like a ride on a mountain road.
The number of winners of great races, including his famous "great seven" in Ascot. He also survived a plane crash and had a ban on launching for drugs.
Three years ago, he stagnated for the first time when he returned after a six-month starting ban, but proved an incredible internal force and despite all the doubters he returned in the best form.
And maybe not the last time - Dettori has already declared he would like to continue race for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin released the Chief of Presidential Office Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released Sergei Ivanov from the position of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin's closest collaborators for many years.
Thirty-sixteen-year-old Ivanov was appointed a special representative for ecology and transport.
The statement from Kreml states that Putin “released Ivanov from his services to the head of the Russian presidential office”, but there was no reason.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno, who was the representative of Ivan since 2012.
Fourty-five-year-old Vajno was a diplomat before.
He was born in Estonia Tallinna capital in 1972, promoted at the prestigious National Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the Ambassador in Tokyo.
On the websites (in Russian) it is stated that he was later making the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
When he appointed Putin, he said: "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your head's activities within the meaning of the draft laws and control of the extent that your instructions are respected.
Putin said on Friday the Russian television station that Ivanov asked him to resign from his post and recommended that Vajno be replaced.
Will they persuade the smiles?
This step totally mysticized Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest colleagues of Vladimir Putin and as Putin worked for KGB.
As the head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was transmitted by the state television, both men declared that the president's office's office was leaving his own request.
But the smiles to cameras have convinced only a few people -- especially now, just before parliamentary elections.
So is it the consequence of some power fight?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man once considered as a possible president, suddenly wants to lead the ecological policy of Russia, has met with great inconfidence.
The Creml page quotes the notes for Putin, in which Ivanov states: “I have asked you in the conversation in 2012 to give me this very difficult post, even a problem post, I have given you four years.
Apparently, I was head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov was captured by the post in December 2011.
He had previously served as Vice-President of the Government and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and earlier, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was commanded by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced KGB, Ivanov was appointed his representative.
When Putin came to power, he appointed Ivanov one of his five closest coworkers.
It even speculated that Ivanov could be the successor of Putin, after his second election period, because the third period would be constitutional for Putin.
But this post took over another close Putin's colleague Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin was only three and a half years later the Prime Minister before returning to the presidential office.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the series of the Criminal Minds, was released after he hit the director
Gibson was involved in the physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
The ABC and CBS television stations produced by the series have notified in the joint declaration of its release.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before he announced his dismissal.
There were creative differences in the scene and I disagree.
I'm sorry that it happened," he said in his statement.
According to the statement of the ABC and CBS TV stations, the details are about how Gibson's figure will disappear from the series that watches the FBI team's stories somewhat later.
Forty-five-five-year-old actor, celebrated the main role in the sitcom of Dharma and Greg, has been effective since the first series in 2005.
"I love the thoughts of the criminal and I have put my heart and soul into them over the last 12 years," Gibson said in his statement on Friday.
I was hoping I'd be in it until the end, but that won't be possible right now.
I'd like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team, and mostly to the great fans that this show could ever hope.
The return of the series to the twelveth series is expected on 28 September.
In Banff, fish landed mysteriously in the garden
A man from Banff's town asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish can be sand corn left in the water.
Bain, living about 500 meters from the sea, published a short film on the Periscope channel in his opinion that someone could help him explain how about 5 centimeters of fish got into his garden.
Queensfery Crossing: Most now connects with Fife
The project for 1,35 billion funds is to be completed by May 2017
The engineers connected the northern platform and Queensfery Crossing and viaduct - the bridge is now connecting with Fife.
So it is the first of the four clocks between “the plots ” which are now almost completed around each of the three pilons of the bridge.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
There are 10,000 tonnes of iron and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 curtains.
The project for 1,35 billion pounds is to be completed by May 2017.
The economic secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the land to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of the construction of Queensfery Crossing.
In this project, we are all witnessing how construction engineers used more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, the conclusion between the viaduct and the plot of the bridge was a delicate operation which required extraordinary precision.
There is now a total of more than 79% of the total surface of the bridge, concrete for the last part of the platform is now poured in Rosytha, so the entire platform is ready to rise up to the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closing of each bridge is always an important militant.
In this amazing project, this closing represents a top of land building.
After installing the last part of the road platform and its connection to the expanding platform of the North Tower, we had to close the last space on the north side - to the land.
We did this by stretching the northern viaduct of 700 millimeters south.
This was massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
It is massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighing approximately 6,000 tonnes, and it was needed to be dragged up at about 3%.
Because the tolerants with which the team worked were very small - only a few millimeters every direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Saved in Moelfre Bay: Three men are “happy to be alive ”
Three men are “happy to be alive ” after the water slipped from their fishing boat in England.
The Moelfr RNLI rescue station announced an alarm on Friday at 13:20 the British summer time after the crew saw the incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim safely, while their boat continued unmanagedly.
"We have seen their boat circulating near them and we have thought of the worst," said Moelfry Vince Jones' rescue boat manager.
"The strong wind, fortunately, took him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men saved a local fishership, a third man aged 60 years was found without a rescue vest exhausted while fighting.
They were all transferred to the coastal rescue boat and transfer back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said: “Three men thrown into the water are happy that they are alive and completely injured.
The ship engine had a rope for an emergency shutdown, but somehow there was a disconnection from the person who was driving the boat when there was a turnover.
Someone on the top of those guys had a protective hand.
The judge refuses to deal with the case for the fatty woman.
Peter Tluchor is one of the three Members who are supposed to be charged with Prime Minister Weather and his then chief of the office of Jana Nagy, a politics, i.e. a lucrative post for political resignation.
In 2012, it was the approval of the tax package.
Snaider, Fuxas and the Tlushors allowed him with their resignations.
Then they appeared on an influenced post in state firms.
They also faced suspects of the bribe and ended for a month in custody.
But according to the court of law, there were compensation for almost 2 million crowns.
The densier now acts as a witness, after the intrusion of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a court building on the Fruit Market and deals with civil disputes.
However, Judge Helena King wants to be cautious (deciding criminal matters - recognition red.) and to prevent possible objections.
The case is likely to be charged by another Prague judicial circuit.
The King has released the guilt of Jana Netime two times before Nagy.
It was an alleged abuse of military intelligence to monitor the first wife of Prime Minister Netime Radka.
In this case, the Fat hasn't been figured.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, it is an unnecessarily excessive response.
I think that impartiality cannot be interpreted so that the court is exclusive if witnesses have a wife or a relative in court.
I'm afraid you can't judge anything, he's noted for a journal.
"I think it's kind of soft," he added.
In the case of political hits, Roman Boček, a former official, is also accused.
But according to his lawyer, Peter Toman would have a chance to succeed.
The District Court for Prague 1 discussed the prosecution of a former chief of the Prime Minister Peter Weather Jana Nagyová (Days Netherms) and other accused of the abuse of military reporting.
On the picture, the Netime comes to court with her husband.
The fat was supposed to be dealing with the words about Peroutk.
For example, the exposal wife was to judge President Milos Zeman's statements on the democratic prewar journalist Ferdinand Peroutk.
Zeman said he was sympathy to Adolph Hitler.
One of the school girls is already dead!
Apparently, the girl died at the aircraft of the Alliance Forces.
She and her two equally old girlfriends flew to Syria last February from the London airport Gatwick.
The British Ministry of Interior did not comment on her death.
The young London girls who fled from home were secretly transported to Syria over the Turkish border.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultanan have been targeted by the media for their next former student from the London School of Bethnal Green Academy.
The case last year caused a huge wave of attention and tension in relations between Britain and Turkey.
The British Security Facility estimates that about 600 British Muslims have traveled to Syria, some 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined the IS radicals and other groups.
Those who come home are a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream work for hundreds of thousands of salaries.
Excellent payable work that you don't even need high school.
That's how it looks at the first look of an Iitian work.
And often the other one.
Because it is not only a high salary in the Czech environment (in Prague you will earn up to 180,000 CZK) but also extreme advantages.
The reason is a huge lack of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
Apparently, almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in Czech Republic.
Among the most searched are the statistics of the Grafton Personal Agency programmers, developers, network engineers and app specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
It is not therefore compromised by candidates on the job, but the job position on candidates, commented Jitka Součkova, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
High school is not a need.
High school education, however, is not necessary for the Ithians.
High school education means a good basis and is a common indicator of intelligence and education of candidates, but often does not have much to share with development knowledge.
Developers must learn new things constantly, which one day a graduate school does not replace, says Peter Kubačka, director Monster Career CZ.
It's the most money it gets in Prague.
The wages of the Ayatians are all over the Republican average.
The biggest money they get in Prague and Brna, it's not like this in the regions.
"The remuneration conditions in Brna are comparable to those Pragues," confirms Cubaka.
Technical directors will reach their highest profits.
In Prague and Brna, they can come to 120 000 - 180 000 Kč.
In other regions, pay is lower, but it does not fall below 80 000 Kč.
The demands are also the IT project managers.
They can make 60,000 to 100,000 CZKs when they enter.
It's also a struggle for graduates.
While in some professions graduates must often go straight to the office of work, it does not apply to the Aythics.
In fact, if the companies retreat and repay an expert from another company, they will be willing to touch the graduate.
Because they can raise him according to their own.
They're not going through without their tongue.
Knowledge of foreign language is suitable in every profession, but it is necessary for the Aythians to be minimumly decent English.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is in some IT positions of need.
On the other hand, we meet a number of cases where companies seek specially an educated and experienced person and only satisfy the average knowledge of English.
For example, if the aid worker controls more foreign speeches, it is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, the Director of Cubačka adds.
Yoo in Google, there's paradise.
Only silently envy the Czech employees of the Google employees.
Of course, it is an flexible working time for them, the possibility of working from home or various short jobs, not only for moms.
"The newly baked dads provide a company with four weeks of extra holiday after the birth of the child," says Martina Jonek, speaker Google.
Hunting also includes health care for employees and family, nutrition, transport, training, wellness or massage directly at the workplace.
Whoever wants to educate, he has green and doesn't matter what he wants to learn.
But that's not the end of the benefits.
Such a full free refrigerator is definitely not to be thrown.
Healthy lunch (in some places and breakfast and dinner) is available every day.
Furthermore, in all offices, there are so - called micro kitchens where people always find a healthy meal, the speaker speaks.
And so that nothing doesn't have to be dismissed, so if it doesn't eat, it's gonna put in boxes that employees can take home tonight.
And the reason for these on the Czech terms of incredible advantages?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"For Google it is not important that employees sit at the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, movements or development, ideas and innovative solutions," the speaker adds.
The UN strongly criticised Bulgaria for the criminalization of refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, UN Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday that he systematically violated human rights by the criminalization of refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "related serious concerns about Bulgaria's failure to comply with international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned.
He noted that "It is particularly anxious to be a witness to how important and influenced public personalities express public support for criminal armed fights that continue to hunt refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey".
"One of the most important problems is that almost all people who go into the Bulgarian territory in an irregular way are automatically arrested," Zeid stressed.
And even worse - they are often criminally persecuted and imprisoned - for a year or longer - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the right of everyone to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria detained 14,000 migrants this year, last year for the same period of 21,000.
Pokémon Go - pursue of Health and Happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
A number of people over the past decade embarrassed that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend their time in front of the screen.
Pokémon raises people from the coffin and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screen originally broke on TV, later on video games and the latest to smart phones.
It's great to watch that technology and activities outside do not exclude each other.
Of course, I'm talking about the fashion that Pokemon Go is, the application based on the buildings that first appeared in video games at the end of the 1990s (later a drawn series, play cards and other).
As with many cultural phenomenons, this new game was introduced at the beginning of July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand to fall interest.
The introduction in other countries was then postponed for a powerful interest that led to the overload of servers.
Pokémon Go won more users over a few days than Tinder and almost as many users as he has Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players on a smart phone go out looking for Pokémones that are watching using GPS, and when they find them, they can "fotify" them (with the screenshot on the phone) or "take".
Manny caught a generation that played a game in her younger age, picked her up from the seats and took her out to look for Pokémoni.
In the United States, this game has resulted in a significant increase in the number of steps that a “natural ” person will do every day.
The Cardiogram for Smart Clocks from Apple, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that during two days of the start of the game, the number of monitored people who exercised each day for 30 minutes has jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who Pokémon Go plays - only sees rough data on levels of exercise.
Many public campaigns strive to “locate 30, ”“ rise out of the couch ” and “was active every day ” fall into unfertile land, because the majority of the messages focused on public health is boring and designed for people who do not look well.
However, the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is participating in weighing, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that we cannot all indicate here.
But the beauty of the Pokémon Go game is that people go out and do something that enjoys them.
You cover three health pillars -- movement, fresh air and sunlight, and entertainment.
Some people even get new friends when hunting for pokemones.
As it is, of course, there will be such boring bullets who seek any reason to complain.
And yes, someone can get in the door.
What's that, like?
There's been a breakdown.
At their time, the application for smart phones, like Fitbit, was able to monitor our activity, but they gave us no reason to do something like this in this game.
The news is looking at, and the interest in it begins to fall at a certain point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémons, there will be other games that will combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help a number of people to hunt for activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles gained gold in a multi-fighting gymnastics of women
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simon Biles is immune against all of this.
Dynamic for jumping.
No effort on the bench.
Everybody's screwed up in the free.
Excellent in everything.
And now finally the Olympic champion.
The nineteen-year-old American gymnast went straight on Thursday after the title in a multi-wall, and the others overcome the full line under the Olympic reflectors.
The total result of 62.198 clearly confirmed its impact in front of the silver medalist and the member of the final five Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) (USA) on Thursday during the showing at the glacier in the final of multiple individuals in sports gymnastics at summer Olympic Games 2016 in Brazil Rio de Janeiro.
Billes became the fourth American in a row that won a multi-struggle, and the fifth total when she confirmed her reputation of the best gymnastical of her generation and perhaps even the best at all.
When her total final evaluation was on the table and her long journey ended until this moment, her tears appeared on her face.
This success sets her into the same league of unique athletes of his time as Michael Phelps, who added a new size to their sports:
The biles sport has been dominating for the last three years, winning 15 medals in world championships - including 10 gold. Her fascinating compositions are the mixture of ambition and precision and the olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton has marked it "the best gymnast she ever seen."
The last test was waiting for her in Brazil, not between Biles and the rest of the race, but between her own and her burden of too many expectations.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas, with a hand full of gold medals, would be considered disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman are hugging after the gold and silver medals in the women's multi-fighting final on summer Olympic games 2016 in Brazil Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
First Biles won Tuesday, when she was as a screamer at the celebration of the departured national team coordinator Martha Karolya.
Billes insists she never looked forward during her long journey, which is not exactly true.
Part of her composition in free - the one that contains her typical triple salto with double turn - is planted in Latin music that would just fit home to the streets outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a bachelor, and her talent was discovered by the mother of Coach Aimee Boorman on the way to the gym, where Boorman was trained and where he got power.
The competition has not lost since the summer of 2013 - this is a victory trail that can continue as long as Biles will want.
Even though Mustafin took over for a short lead with two turns, it was just an illusion.
Clude and free - where Biles defends the world championship - are waiting.
She came back to her head with 15,433 points at a buffer - and ended with 15.933 points in free.
Raisman hugged her gently when they waited for the final score - just formality - and around brightly red, white and blue shadows, the Billes appeared to tears when the desires that had been fulfilled once when she was a kid, she entered in the diary.
The performance of Raisman was a little retribution for the olympiade four years ago, when she shared a third line with Mustafin, but then she had a bronze for the sum of three best compositions.
This time, the twenty-five-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call "bab", was quite ahead.
After her free, she was sending a crowd of air kiss, defeated by return, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles she has a contribution that this nineteen-year-old athlete placed on Twitter this week, where it became a complete hit, a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in the case of a serial killer shot at listening to music in the car
According to the police report published on Thursday, two women and a girl aged 12 years of age died during the most important decade attack, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot when they sat in the car, talked and listened to music.
The authorities announced that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefania R. Ellis and daughter Ellis Maleah were shot in the car parked on the arrival road on June 12th.
The report states that an armed man stood on the side of the rider and burned eight wounds from his hand, and then fled in another vehicle.
According to the police, it's not worth triple robbery because the attacker didn't take the wallets, nor the amount of $2,900 that one of the adults had.
Speaking police in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said investigators were investigating whether the shooting had no connection with any of the previous four attacks.
In two mostly Spanish quarters, a total of nine attacks occurred during four months, where seven people were killed and two others were injured.
“It is happening in the villa quarter before the houses” Howard said earlier this month for the KPHO branch CBS station.
The police believe that the suspect used several cars, including brown Nissana from the end of the 1990s, black BMW from the end of the 1990s and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to tell what evidence led them to the conclusion that the attacks were related and committed by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was transported to a hospital where she later suffered from her injury.
Liner (31) and daughter Ellis Maleah died in the spot.
The witness told the police that it was not unusual that women were sitting in a parked car and listening to music.
The officials also published a police report on the shooting target which was an empty van only half an hour before the three-fold murder.
The investigators found the bullets and made a bullet from the rest of the bullets in the seat.
A mother of a six - year - old child with a microcephalia: “His condition is improved ”
Edmund Picciuto, like most children of his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mom.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from a microcephalia, which is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, I first thought I couldn't handle this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not at all true - of course you're ready for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund may never know them and that she may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in the constitution.
"My first response was that I thought people were not doing this today," explains Picciut.
Edmund's walking with a walker.
Until he was three years old, he couldn't sit, nor crawl, and he still doesn't talk.
Some of the boundaries are already filling slowly.
He's walking with help and riding a bike.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth presents a sign speech by which Edmund says “please sing to me. ”
"We teach him a sign language," said Picciut for CBS News.
But it's not an ordinary sign speech - says Edmund made some signs himself.
Microcephalia may occur from a number of different states: genetic, such as Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as bedrooms or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may differ significantly.
It's too early to tell us what effect Zik's gonna have on life infected.
Picciue reminds the emotional tax he chooses a uncertain future.
I keep asking, ‘ What will happen next? ’
What's next?
And she's still not sure about that.
In fact, I never asked what a total prognosis is, because I don't expect anyone to tell me.
But Picciut has an encouraging report for mothers of all children who suffer from inherent defects caused by Zika.
The situation is getting better.
You know it'll be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Silent rain and floods demanded rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The strong rain and large floods in Louisiana forced the governor to announce an emergency state on Friday. The state expects further rains on Saturday.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) announced that a number of rivers in Louisiana and south of Mississippi are exploding from their coasts and threatening large floods.
Governor Louisiany John Bel Edwards said that government officials are constantly in contact with local authorities and aid is already on their way to disastrous areas.
Mike Steele, Governor's Office for National Security and Preparation for the crisis situation, said they were receiving requests for vehicles for water, boats and bags with sand.
Steele said that only the Tangipahoa district asked for 10,000 sand bags.
Flood patrols will remain in most South Louisiana to work until Saturday.
The weather service stated that more than 8 to 13 centimeters could rain over the sea.
In South Alabama there was a flood patrol on Friday when rain continued in the area of Mobile.
According to the predictions, the Comite Rivers at Baton Rouge and Amit at Denham Springs are to be accumulated on the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said they both said they could flood a series of homes in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He further stated that the dangers are floods in the district of Ascension, where these divorced streams will only be poured slowly to the lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, a little south of the Mississippi state in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached at Friday at 9 a.m. at the local time to the highest recorded level.
Saviors are still picking up people from the invasive waters in the county of Amita and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his son, were already on Friday between the rescued in the Gloster.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose quickly over the night.
He said he was alerted by his next son, who lived nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming," said Hansford.
I had it to the passport.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's ever experienced in the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said he and all his family are infected and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford stated that the crisis workers saved all three huge cars in military style and transported them to a fire station in Gloster, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that the floods are "speedly spreading" and the authorities consider evacuation.
According to Krautmann, a observer near Livinstone announced that from midnight to Friday to morning, 35 inches of rainfall fell.
Crowtmann said that the soil was in the middle.
The authorities stated that the excellent rain and paid travel demanded rescue of people from their homes in the Tangipahoa district and abolition of the training in five school districts.
The WWL branch of CBS announced that, according to the elder of Tangipahoa, 200 homes were flooded.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, but both are now flooded.
The mayor of the village, Robby Miller, stated that the authorities saved 72 people and seven household animals that were captured by high water.
In the village of Amita and Hammond, there were facilities for those evacuated.
"They will be able to return home when the water starts to fall," he said.
In the Tangipahoa district in Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed because of the flood, and locals received bags with sand that they could pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"We had the last great floods here in March," Lacy Landrum, head of town, said.
Looks like these floods are going to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, manager for the crisis situation in the County of Harrison in Mississippi state, stated that the coast of the Persian Gulf continues with persistent rain.
He said on Thursday, a couple of homes were melted, but none of them showed up in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amit, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places where I've never seen her before," said Townson, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "the boy shooting as fired", survived the shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, and this week it was a second shot on a child aged 6 years old in the city.
Her grandparents for CBS Philadelphia identified her as Mahaje Brown.
The grandparents say the boy suffered a few shooting injuries, including weaknesses, legs, arms and stomach, but when he was transported to the hospital, he was conscious.
"He grabbed it so much, his little body was shot as fixed," said his grandmother's station Delores Melendez.
I can't believe it.
The boy's in a critical state in the hospital and he's succeeded in several operations.
The family for the station said the boy should be healed.
He was supposed to go to the first grade of basic school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four men who were shot in the Germantown part.
Another three men were shot: two at 29 and one at 32 years of age.
One of the men aged 29 is in critical state, according to CBS Philadelphia, there are two more victims in a stabilized condition.
According to the report, the child was found shot at the front seat of the vehicle with a nine-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims weren't in the car and the police are looking into whether one of the wounded men could be a shooter.
CBS Philadelphia's investigators reported that there was probably a shooter among several armed men.
At the site, the guns of the attack type were found, belonging to various attack weapons.
I guess it was definitely a continuing battle.
There were bullets on the street on both sides of the pathway.
So it appears that there were several armed fighters who were actively involved," stated Captain of the Philadelphian Police of Anthony Ginaldi for the station.
Several homes and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No one's been arrested, and the police are allegedly investigating videos from the cameras.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot in her arm with a broken shot on Tuesday in front of the house in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl's recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's how I imagine a female gymnast team for this year's Olympic games, for a few reasons.
First of all, I've been on every summer olympics since 1984 and the United States have never been so dominant.
And second: There are three gymnastics in this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired so many young color girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, supplemented by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
Finally, we have a team that looks like America.
He also reinforced the presence of black and Latin Americans on the top of this sport.
The gimnastic number one in the past four years was Afro-American.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second line last year.
That means something.
In the last olympics, Gabby Dougals became a surprising champion of the Olympic Games, and America was jasling.
Now the world could be witnessed by the unbelievable performance of the triple world victory of Simona Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who showed unexpected but artificial gymnastical figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American who won gold in a woman's struggle of individuals.
And a member of the team, Aly Raisman, got silver.
We are witnesses of the sports summit, but it doesn't look like that in the gymnastical class in the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie graduated the same way to the Olympic team as Ali and Madison.
They're a "final fifth" because the gymnast team for the next Olympic game will only be composed of four athletes, and this is the last year when Martha Karolya trains.
But the reality is that gymnastics are financially difficult sports and gymnasts are mainly trained in private gymnastical clubs that maintain parents who pay training costs, equipment, travels, coaches, hotel accommodation fees (for coaches and their trustees and families). And that is not all.
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in the suburb that activities can support.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all training and for families of gymnasts and gymnasts is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they started in gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring training gymnastics that are more available and accessible to the communities of the absence of young girls that Simone, Gabby and Laurie inspired.
I founded a gymnastical fund 20 years ago.
In my organisations where we offer free gymnastics or low costs in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (usually black and Spanish) and we trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and gain from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and mind determination.
This combination means life benefits for good health, success in school and at work.
The inspiration of this team will send to us thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for proving the "girl power" and wining the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all origin to get on the way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter other strikes
The ministers hoped that after the reconciliation of the treaty, representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would end the differences in the change, but 58 per cent of 37,000 young doctors who participated in the elections refused the contract.
Hunt revealed in July plans to force the contract with NHS being in “no one” and other delays would have a harmful impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new treaty that includes changes in night and weekend working procedures to improve care in non-social hours.
The physician Ellen McCourt, President of the BMA Commission for young doctors in the statement last night, said: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that the current working forces crisis will rise and, therefore, fair treatment with all doctors. ”
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors pass under a new contract, progress is needed and time is out.
The efforts of BMA to solve disputes through negotiations were not willing to involve Dr. and often deafly silent by the government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this option is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, push on force and solve the concerns of young doctors."
If this does not happen, young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits, because sisters and specialists were invited to represent doctors who were among protesters.
The Ministers hoped that, after the contract was reconstituted, representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would conclude the differences relating to changes.
BMA wants higher payments for the weekend for 54,000 young doctors who would be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Chairman of Employers of NHS, invited young doctors not to enter any strike.
Mortimer said: “Operational action will only reach a few or nothing but there will be pressure on already overwhelmed teams and services, and there will rise concerns, exhaustion, and disturbances for patients, treatment personnel and their families. ”
In the past two months, we have dealt with the advice of young doctors and with the Ministry of Health and have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervisor and informer.
Employers hoped that continuing positive involvement in other important issues - such as exhaustion, flexibility in schools, further training for those who are returning after the interruption of their career, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study free and distinction in payments between sex - was proof of how serious employers, Health Education of England and the Ministry of Health are taking agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
Medicinal product by 60 crowns a day may reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients in danger of the heart attack will be able to use a medicine that is overcompensated with about 60 crowns (two pounds).
The medicine against ticagrelor blood disorders reduces the risk of the infarction in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now administered after the infarction process for 12 months to reduce the risk of infarction or other infarction.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the medicinal product be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, some 140 000 people suffer from a heart attack or heart attack every year.
Infarction and strokes are caused by accumulation of fat that creates a related layer on the arteries walls.
If this layer is distracted, there may be a blood collapse, blocking the blood access to the heart and the infarction of a heart attack.
If the slaughter is released, the blood site can continue, block the blood injury into the brain and cause a brain stroke.
People who have already committed a heart attack are exposed to a higher risk of another attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the Brilique business name, reduces the risk by reducing the possibility of the formation of ruins.
In the proposal for the NICE Directive, which was published today, it is recommended that patients receive 90 mg ticagrelore for 12 months and then 60 mg along with aspirin twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite the availability of an effective secondary preventive treatment, there is a quarter of patients who had a heart attack and who suffered another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences. ”
The fear of repeating may have a significant negative impact on the quality of the patient's life.
It is demonstrated that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of other heart attacks and stroke in people who have already suffered from the infarction.
We are pleased that, in the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can extend the treatment opportunities available to many thousands of people who will be able to gain from it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelore - especially the risk of bleeding - above the framework of three years is limited, it is not recommended in the proposal for treatment over this period.
Computer culture began to grow fraud in Muslim areas
Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was revoked last year for corruption, which was linked to the government report
The culture of political correction has led to overlooking the widespread fraud in Muslim communities, stated today in the government report.
Former Minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticizes the police, the electoral inspectors and the Council for ignoring the abuse of voters for “sensitiveness to ethnicity and religion”.
The former secretary of the community, now the ruler of anti-corruption, said that intimidation of voters based on their religion is so bad that the police should do cordons and warned voters to protect from the election rooms.
He recommended that the voters take with them a document of identity and can prove who they are at the elections.
Currently, the voter shall only specify his name and address.
The report further suggests that people's fingers in their voice to put in an infinite ink in order to prevent anyone to vote twice.
Whistleblowers should have greater protection, says Pickles.
It requests that the press get more access to the documents from the meeting and to decisions adopted by non-official committees or working groups.
"It is not only protection against electoral frauds, but also the protection of the local government from the wider corruption environment and financial frauds that are hand-to-handed," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of the electoral scandal in Tower Hamlets in West London.
In last year, the Special Election Court decided that the mayor of the city of Lutfur Rahman should be revoked from his post after the charge of corruption and illegal practices.
The Court found that Rahman “cinicly hit ” the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his criticism with the accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, according to his words, “he took his campaign so that it was a religious obligation of dedicated Muslims to vote for him. ”
When 300 votes have been questioned or as a result of the stealing of identity when a person votes and gives up someone else.
Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed special concerns about the fraud in the correspondent vote - which it is claimed that the elderly members of the Muslim community during it had a pressure on people to vote for the candidates they chose.
Sir Eric, on the picture, made several recommendations of how to clean up the electoral system, including the presentation of the document of identity
His report states: “The proof of the vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, was raised by pressure to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in the communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh. ”
“The concerns have occurred that... state institutions have closed their eyes to such conduct because of “politically correct ” hypersensitivity against ethnic origin and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations of how to clean up the system, including that political activists are not allowed to manipulate correspondent votes and prevent "exhaustion of votes".
The report now evaluated by Theresa May also requests more detailed checks in registrations to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and dosage fraud.
Consider the possibility of requesting voters to submit a document of identity before the vote.
Using an unleashable ink on people's fingers in voting to prevent someone to vote twice.
Implementation of systematic nationality controls to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence vote to limit for three years.
Forbid political agitators and activists to manipulate their correspondent votes and election envelopes.
Give the police permission to create around the Cordone's election rooms.
Change the laws so that it is easier to pursue persons developing illegal pressure under the Reform Act of 1983.
Disable acquiring photos in the electoral rooms.
Require only the English (except the Wales) to work in the electoral rooms.
Enhanced training and ensure that employees follow the rule that voters go to the electoral cabins separately.
Sir Eric criticizes the London Police and says it's "surprising", that after the Tower Hamlets case no charges were filed for crimes.
"The election court excluded Lutfur Rahman and his agent for the lithania of corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty over the framework of reasonable doubts - in the power of evidence of a crime.
It also criticizes the ineffective “control of pinches” in the branch offices for the registration of voters at the Council.
Sir Eric said: “Later's court decision in the Tower Hamlets case by awakening.
Our nation has a proud link to the colleague of parliamentary democracy, but anxious and hidden spread of electoral frauds and the state of rejection of certain authorities threatens this reputation.
Crazy cyclic binary of the Duke of Kate and other binaries known in the Rio Olympiade
Olympic game fans in Riu 2016 freaked out on the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, which is quite impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the fourteen-year-old olympionic is not the only athlete that seeks gold this year, which can be admired by his own double of a number of known personalities - at least not by social networks.
To celebrate the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous personalities that currently appear on our screens, the F.A.P.P.P. has made a list of olympics that are more than remotely similar to the Hollywood celebrity.
As a loving beast: a member of the US Arrows team Brady Ellison (left) was compared to Leonard DiCapria since a little bit.
In addition to Kate's binary, a number of people on the online quickly pointed out that a certain arrow could be a twin of star Leonard DiCapria.
The American Shooter team, Brady Ellison, caused a storm on Twitter after his pictures came out, and it was pretty similar to the wolf from Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed the media's madness and admitted that he had heard about his similarity with Leo since he was a kid.
"I don't see a great similarity, perhaps except the beards," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a dude and looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will not doubtably be emphasized this year: an impressive image between the British jumping to the distance of Greg Rutherford and the favorite actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafin, with her big, significant eyes, was said to be a copy of a Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star Gell Matthew Morrison for several years.
And to change: The user thinks that Nathan with the "athletic version" actress from the film Home (Inception)
Another long-term comparison is the comparison of Rafael Nadal's tennis star and hero Josh Hartnett, who have similar dense eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver swimming Yulia Efimov is proud not only of the same eating skin and blond hair as Annalyn McCord, and about Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, the fans say she looks like a “athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt. ”
Excellent women: Football star Hope Solová (left) and actress of Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar form of face and eyes
Not only one: The Twitter user was very pleased that the similarity was observed by others
On the waves of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for similar treatment of couples
One Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction on the website that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are in truth identical. ”
The Football Star Hope Solo and the actress of Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have a really unbelievably similar form of face and eyes.
Among other favorite comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical with the smile of her actress Laura Linney, or the holder of the gold medal for the gymnastics Gabby Douglas, proud of her beautiful wide smile, which is like copying the smile of Gabrielle Union, the stars of the movie Bravo, girls!
The commentator of the Olympic Games of the CBC station is apologised for saying that the Chinese swimming was "exploded"
Olympic Olympic Live Transmission Divers at the CBC Station was incited by a 14-year-old Ai Yanhan commentator Byron MacDonald. The plavice ended on the fourth stage of the women's race at 4x200 m of the bars with a free style.
The Canadian CBC station was forced to apologize after one of its commentsors said that a fourteen-year-old Chinese swimming in the race "watched like a smell" and "exploded".
The commentator Byron MacDonald believed that his microphone was off when at the end of the final of the women's chafet at 4x200 meters freely began to swing his own views.
MacDonald, who had to bring “freety ” to the CBC commentator team, said, inter alia: “The little 14 - year - old girl from China gave it up, you screwed up. ”
Excessive excitement, she dried like a smell, exploded.
Thank you.
The Chinese swimming Ai Yanhan (14) sailed the second race chafet at 1:57.79 - that is 1,61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed the Canadians to reach China.
The divers in Canada began to respond quickly online and were frightened by the tone and tongue that the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: “He said that the voter on CBC that the 14-year-old swimming girl from China exploded??????
The idiot didn't notice he's still in the radio."
Ai Yanhan of China, at the final of the women's cafet race at 4x200 meters, was described in a free style as: “The little 14-year-old of China gave it up. ”
The criticism of Byron MacDonald came from all sides on Twitter and many asked for his appeal.
When the Twitter users learned how unsensitive Byron MacDonald is, they didn't stay back.
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You're representing CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we'd be a racist band.
Soon afterward, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC, apologize for the live comment of MacDonald, said: “We apologize for the comment of the swimming swimming that fled to the broadcast. ”
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry that it happened."
The CBC station eventually apologized for more than 90 times to those who tweeted in the comment response
Communist Scott Russell had to apologize on the name of MacDonald
CBC then copied and filed their apology to the answer for more than 90 Twitter users who complained about the commentator MacDonald's comments
The station also quickly apologised and published the statement.
He honestly regrets that the words were said, not to get into the eter.
We quickly apologize to our watchers in the broadcast and those watching us on social networks.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimming, not the swimming.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast and tried to explain his note by claiming that he didn't want to sound like a personal attack.
"I'd like to apologize now for the comment I put last night after a woman's chafe," he said in the Olympiade radio at the CBC station.
"I meant the performance of the swimming, not the person of the swimming."
"No need to say that I had no intention of disrespect and I am very sorry."
Customers in Primark disturbed by a woman who was unshamelessly testing underwear in the middle of the trade
When a woman was dressed out to test her pants in the middle of Primark’s sales area, they weren't shopping sure which way to look.
To make it worse, she tried how her size falls, she took off her pants and brought them back to the regall.
She continued to see and eventually tried four pairs of pants in the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Flokestone.
Business Primark in the Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkestone, where a woman tried panties before she returned them to the regall
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store for a certain time, stated that a mysterious woman “wears her new clothes and she went out of the store without buying anything. ”
She said: “The people could not believe their own eyes.”
She stood in the middle of the store, took off her pants, took her own stockings and pants and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place -- just stood there, stood like a monkey."
"Everyone was staring at the way she took her pants off again, and apparently she didn't like them because she returned them to the regall."
She did the same with three others before she finally decided she didn't like anything, she dressed herself again and left.
"She seemed like she didn't mind who was looking -- or even thinking about the man who might buy the pants she tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: “The idea that someone would take the pants home that someone else had on, and no one cleaned them, that is disgusting. ”
The event happened Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “When she left, I collected things that I obviously tried to withdraw from the sale - which is also the only right thing. ”
"I would have been afraid of bringing home new pants and finding out that another woman had on it, she took them off, and they were not washed."
The speaker of the Primark trade said: “Primark knows about the incident that happened in our Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9th."
All the products concerned were withdrawn from sales.
How to defend against the attack of weapons using Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but because of this Dailymail.com video, it could be safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, the Master of the Krav Maga Federation, sitting in New York to find out how to deal with armed thieves in a close distance.
This video will show you how suddenly to get a violent advantage, whether he approaches you from the front or from the back.
If he approaches you from the back, he says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and “will have a free path of shots. ”
Then you grab a weapon between your elbow and your shoulder just before you hit him in the face with a lobby.
Then he follows his knee to the weaknesses, and while the attacker shins in pain, you swing his arms out of his hand, you hit his head in the face and you start retreating, and you keep your gun onto him.
If an armed man approaches you from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the fire line, grab the gun and pull it out so that the bad guy can't shoot.
At the same time, put your strength in the weapon and hit the assaulter into your chest, then pull the gun out of his clothing and start retreating, and keep moving on it.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video where you'll see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get out of the robbery - unless you're very stressed by Krav Maga - is to issue all cash.
The traveler Ian Wright lies the most dirty places in Europe to the travel guide
The British traveler decided to fail to test his immunity system and a long reflex - by licking the most dirty and ugly places in Europe.
The modeler and author of Ian Wright (51), originating in Suffolk, licked his tongue with a euro banknote, a barrier on Piccadilly Circus, a toilet button in the train and a Russian public phone.
He used a luminometer before he licks each object to show himself and all of us what he's starting to do.
The experiment based on the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, however, brought interesting results.
The idea to lick the train button that used thousands of other people can seem completely disgusting, however, there are much more harmful bacteria in the kitchen dried.
Ian Wright talked to doctors and health specialists during his entire journey across Europe about the strengthening of intestinal flura bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of what he licked left in his mouth anything worse than the smell.
Ian Wright was celebrated by testing the resistance of his wombs on the roads around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he completely safely tested his immunity system - from public branches on train stations after the benchmark
In a film that he filmed, he says: “I have not cared much about my health since my childhood, and I have been putting everything possible in my mouth, from clay to eat worms and worms. ”
He confirmed his reputation in the movie.
The only thing he refused was dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple wash, the luminometer showed the value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia but lick refused after his luminometer showed more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish producer of milk products Valio recorded a traveling film named The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, showing numbers of bacteria in various places, such as in the bathroom
In the movie, he said, “This is almost the most disgusting thing I've ever felt in the bathroom. ”
There's nothing more dirty than this!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was recorded in collaboration with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
Mr Wright provided Valio Gefilus with milk acids and vitamins C and D that help people strengthen the intestinal bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice-president of Valio for meals, juices, and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would be watching the intrigue and at the same time would allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've come up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea "Let's call Ian."
It is said that the infant health interest becomes a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in broader connections - good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of infant health and how it is connected with the immune system.
The growing interest in the healthy worm is a global phenomenon and through this document we have brought more information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “Let's say this, Ian would have lost my respect if he licked something from what I wanted to do -- such as the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the movie. ”
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, others were quite difficult.
I'm glad we've taken some of those dirty things off."
In 2015, Valio conducted an examination that 84% of the respondents combined milk acid bacteria with the health of the stomach and the womb and 58 per cent of the respondents indicated that at least they use milk acid products at least occasionally.
The socially needed family destroyed the general building in Saltash, Cornwall
The family of the socially needed left damage in its general house of 50,000 pounds after the charges for terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were moved out of the house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their violent immigration from the house, the residents of the apartment were shocked when they found that property was in an accident.
There were holes in the walls, the floor cover was crushed, the waste stood everywhere on the floor, and the walls were scratched.
Family has already moved and is considered to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, the Chief of Residence in Cornwall Housing, said she was worried if she was going to save the house.
She said: “This was a nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
We need to consider a number of circumstances, because this real estate is probably entering the consciousness as "not that nice" of Cornwalle.
This family is disgustingly known and their names are disgracefully famous.
The couple have three sons who were living in the house sometimes, and the police stated that the horror that the family had incurred, were the street battles with baseball sticks, the intimidation of surrounding inhabitants, drug use, drug distribution, and a loud scream, arguing, arguing, and suspension.
Sceldon (47), whose name was listed on the rental contract, was punished in June for anti-social behaviour.
In several rooms in the house that may be broken, was found smelling waste.
In the house where drugs were distributed in the past, the floor cover was erased
The neighbors say they saw them on the street washing, and people regularly called the police here.
Cornwall Housing moved her and her partner out of the house violently this week after they received an additional term of 11 weeks to move in volunteer.
The neighbors who had relieved welcomed the emigration with their lives to be a living hell.
One of them said: “They did not care about anyone at all. ”
We've lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, you can't count at all.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because there was incredible silence - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a supervisor in the neighbourhood of Cornwall Housing, said that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the police were regularly called to the house.
Waste and old toys screwed up in the growing part of the general house
He adds: “It is a shame that the satellite has not been able to accept responsibility for her own behaviour and for behaviour of her family. It is always the last step that Cornwall Houseing considers.
It was a very complicated case, because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to be scaring her neighbours.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, and the members of the local community, who bravely informed us.
I hope this step brings some comfort to the neighbors, and at the same time brings the message that we will not tolerate unsocial behaviour.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons who lived in a different house were about 20 years old.
Polluted mattress that remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house
Workers will now have to remove the garbage of waste that remained thrown around the house
In 2014, she carried out police in the house raid and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weight, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
She got a penalty when she was found guilty of holding the drugs of class B that she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was intended for the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is considered that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffitis.
The police say they're going to seek to dismiss mercenaries who violate the rules of their rental contracts.
Angela Crow from Denov and Cornwall police stated that the dismissal was a clear message for other mercenaries who would continue to violate the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can be acting without punishment, and to those who wish to follow such behavior," she said.
The police will never tolerate criminal and non-social behaviour and will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal frightened after a low flight of a military trip aircraft above the beach
Tourists who enjoyed sunlight in Portuguese Aveir were scared to death
The Portuguese military aircraft flight P-3C Orion flyed unbelievably low
Military aircraft declared that it was a training flight, and insisted that there was no threat to security.
The moment the low flying trigger struck over the full beach, the frightened tourists panic caught.
The dramatic recordings see how the military plane reaches nearly the distance from the sun's people on the sand beach in the city of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The tourists began to rise after the noise of the motors of the airplane was disturbed without seeing what would come out of the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova near town of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the several recreators who published the videos of a dramatic flying on social networks, said: “The plane went twice really low and it seemed to fall apart at one moment. ”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I surfed and I really thought the plane would fall on my head. ”
Tourists on the beach in Aveir were terrified when a plane flying low from darkness appeared
The Portuguese military aircraft today declared that the P-3C Orion pilot was on a training flight to identify the fishing ships on the coast and had to take down low because it was the only way to check the ship.
The plane was allegedly flying about something lower than usual, due to the bad visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, aircraft insisted that human security was not threatened.
This summer, forest fires destroyed the part of land Portugal and demanded four lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese military aircraft today declared that the pilot had to fly low because of the dense fog and the smokes from fires that stopped him in view
The flight was on the train flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing ship within the training.
Half the funeral services do not comply with the rules.
Half of the funeral providers does not comply with the law.
The Czech Trade Inspection (CHOI) found that in the second quarter checks.
The funeral services, according to it, do not frequently inform the remaining of their prices or provide written confirmation of the contract.
The CHI stored 41 penalties in total of 73,000 crowns for that purpose.
Today, her speaker Jirija Fröhlich informed her.
Inspectors found doubts at 47 out of 95 checks.
In addition to the non-information of prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or services under other prices than agreed.
In five cases, the sales products were not properly marked and once the seller used an officially unchecked measure.
Therefore, the inspection prohibited sales of 23 products for a total of 7077 crowns.
It was related to urna packagings, candle covers and vases which were not properly marked by mandatory information.
"Because this specific area of services continues to be violated by the law, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
A london student who joined IS was killed in Syria
It was announced that Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS, died in Syria.
Advocate Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned about her death in Syrian Racca a few weeks ago.
ITV News announced on Thursday that she was likely killed during the Russian air attack in Racca, which is the garden group in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just when she was preparing to escape from the war of a narrowed country and to return to Britain.
"A man wishes to believe that the only good thing in all this -- as a message and a warning for others that these are the real dangers associated with the journey to the war zone -- is that he will prevent people from making decisions," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other students from the eastern part of London entered a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then a bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultana family learned that she married the IS warrior in Syria - and she was widowed for a few months.
Reid says if Clinton is chosen, she'll leave Garland as a candidate of the Supreme Court.
The leader in the Senate for the Democratic Party, Harry Reid, says he is convinced that the presidential candidate for Democrats Hillary Clinton nominates Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in case of his election.
The Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, even though President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The leader of the Senate majority, Mitch McConnel, says that the person who replaces the dead judge of the Supreme Court will be elected by the future president.
Reid announced during the conference call on Thursday that he believed that Clinton would choose Garland "with a certain degree of confidence."
Reid's speaker later said that he didn't directly talk to Clinton about whether Garland would be nominated and only speculated.
He appreciated Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want someone else to "shake the boat."
Garland is the president of the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Reid said that the Republicans blocking Garland's appointment are "slugs" and "shocking" of the Republican candidate to the Presidential Office of Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't in the office.
According to Treats magazines, naked calendars for “womans and men”
The magazine Treats is closely cooperating with photographer David Bellemer to issue the calendar for 2017, inspired by Pirelli calendar since 70s.
But instead of discovered famous personalities, they try to find another generation of top models for their calendar 2017 NU Muses.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine full of naked is different from Playboy from the old school because "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing it for women.
Apparently, he believes that the calendar is also.
"We must return to show overtime and classical nakedness when women and men feel pleasantly and let them be inspired by the photographs of the woman's body," Shaw said in the press statement to issue the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can send their photos online or personally during open audiences in Los Angeles and New York.
Where is vinyl going: who really buys gramophone boards?
Vinil loves lonely men in mid-age.
Before you decide to swallow the comment section with pepper notes under the pseudonom No AllOsmiliMansIn the Middle Age, we substantiate that this sentence is based on real data.
According to YouGov, such a discussion of the resurrection of gramophones is linked not to a boom of millions who want to love the originality of physical object’s property but with the nostalgy of the middle age.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are most likely people between 45 and 54 years of age.
Young people aged 18-24 are at least likely.
It's not even about a bunch of emotional fans -- all this has an emotional dimension: older people who buy gramophones, are likely to keep their feelings (56% versus 53%) and they like themselves (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog was broadcast as a TV report, I would have been watched by a camera as I go to a disturbing street in Soho, dressed in a decent grey suit and a wide gesture. Then I would stop, pull my hands out and say something authoritative, like, "Let's look at it."
Let's see.
While Soh's heart is slowly wiped out of his charm and spell - buildings once covered by independent sellers are now filled with hotels, restaurants and dinings, confessions and office needs - several fantastic specialized shops with gramophone boards have remained.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a while, and I'll stand close to different men in these shops and try to observe their age and emotional mood.
Stuart (55), a relative from Glasgow, whom I watch from Sister Ray (the numbers: two young women, three men of the middle age) to Reckless Records (the numbers: eight men of middle age, one woman approximately 20) has a meeting in London this afternoon and is looking at shops to fill a few hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I've got about three or four thousand tapes.
All those tapes break the walls of his living room - on the picture upstairs (the picture sent me e-mail, I didn't follow him home).
This huge quantity of albums and singles also has because he can afford it: he can now buy gramophones that he couldn't afford when they first went out, and he's buying what he sold in youth and didn't even have a windra.
“There are things that would be issued when I was 11 or 12 years old and I was too small and couldn't acquire them,” he says.
They agree that those who buy videos are probably introverts who love the company themselves.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works in Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of customers he meets are joined in the YouGov profile.
He also noticed the new influx of people affected by the media wave. People who heard of the comeback and felt forced to buy their old gramophones back.
According to my conversations, the people of their collections had been excluded mostly between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their gramophone boards and shopping CDs now sell their CDs to buy their gramophones back," he says.
That could explain the boom of the fans of gramophone boards of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of gramophone boards?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find a pleasant community of people with similar thoughts in a shop like Phonica.
According to Weze, some senior customers are particularly distorted by the system of non-contact payments.
In the digital world, some gramophone board fans may feel swallowed and decided for the famous environment of gramophone boards, things that cause memories of peaceful maturity.
"I think that the fulfilment of a space or possession of something material may bring some comfort," says Wez.
I'm a collector alone, I'm in my house, and I think a lot of people are too.
It's a easy way to fill a place in your head.
“We are all like their social workers!” a collaborator calls from a bunch of gramophones.
The ICM survey revealed in April that nearly 50% of the people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not yet been heard.
According to the survey, 41% of the queried gramophone has no gramophone, which they never use, while 7% of those who buy gramophones have no gramophone.
At this point of the report he probably seemed seriously concerned about the bunch of compilations of the boss new.
The aspect of “trophy” and the recovery of interest is something that Jonny (42), who works in Sounds of the universe (number: three men of mid age).
"Someone recently came and said, "I don't have a gramophone yet, but I want to buy on the Radiohead desk so that we can put it on the sheet," he says.
The percentage of these is not big, but it happens.
It's more of a product page than a music.
People who say, "I don't have a gramophone."
These are younger people, not older, grown teenagers who get into it.
Fopp, where nearly one floor is currently reserved with gramophone boards, has much more visitors in my arrival.
There's a couple of 70s, tourists doing photos, teenagers and women in mid-age.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the stores before - from the reproductors instead of the pushing jazz calls the latest pop of Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex, it is good to see different customers.
None of them seemed particularly lonely, but you can hardly estimate the mental trauma when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) walks in Fopp for a few minutes and examines various gramophones in the discount.
She's one of those who are rather looking at expenses than expensively spending.
According to his words, she doesn't make much money, so she doesn't think she's collecting gramophones.
It's worth a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on your computer or so. But gramophones have their spell... ," he sighs eagerly.
I can't explain -- it's unique.
My last stop is a shop that reportedly inspired a new generation of lovers of gramophone boards: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend that I'm very busy with girls in tired jeans and I'm watching a group of nine-year-old girls who are just arguing around the Polaroid cameras, and then the father and his daughter decide to buy a Crosley gramophone.
The left is a staircase whose walls cover Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: mixture of current and classical music, the basis of any average collection of gramophones.
Nobody's looking at them - maybe just because they're just for decorations and some are so high on the wall that they can't be reached.
It's purely a vinyl trick.
But since any attraction to it could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the Soo depths for the next, there is no much to complain about.
No surprise is that the demographic area, where more time and money are likely than in other areas, is also the most spending for the most luxurious goods that he is.
But while I find that the results of YouGov appear to be precise - so at least in gramophone shops, they do not consider a large quantity of collectors and lovers of vinyl that exist in reality, in gramophone shops and online forums.
These people probably work hard at schools or offices.
He certainly does not spend the fourth morning swimming around the shops with gramophone boards on Berwick Street, walking through recordings and avoiding looking at a strange, thirty-year-old fake television moderator who hides behind the back of no mid-aged men.
The Grenland Shark is the longest living revolver - video report
According to scientists, the granular shark has the longest average lifetime of all the revolvers on the planet.
Julius Nelsen, who studies sharks, says that the recording shows a female whose age is estimated between 272 and 512 years and measuring five meters
The Court in France refused to break stores in the refugee camp of Jungle.
The Court in France rejected the order of offices in Calais to demolish dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During this week's trial, the authorities in Calais suggested that the State should be able to cancel a total of 72 commission trades where people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hair shaving, in commission restaurants they sell tea for 50 cents or basic foods for several euros.
The Prefect's office in Calais argumented that places must be crashed because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they mean the danger of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organisations in the court stated that trades and restaurants are vital and that free foods offered by the State supported associations and other groups do not provide supplementary food for increasing numbers of refugees in the camp.
The disputed commission shops and restaurants often provide accommodation and food for free to people in need.
The Court of Justice in Lille decided that there is no legal basis that would prevent the people from operating 72 commission trades, but stated that the objections of the prefect Calais were “a very understandable”.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that sales of food, cafes and restaurants have a much greater role than just eating people who “live in extremely desperate conditions. ”
He said spaces provide peaceful places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the demolition was the cafe in the camp, the Jungle Book Kids, which operates by an unprofit organization and which daily offers 200 meals, hours of English, and French, and asylum advice for hundreds of minors threatened without accompanying camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the “childish ” cafeteria.
Guardian received a letter to close the café “will be a catastrophe for these children, some of them are only eight years old. ”
The charitable organisation Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the numbers of refugees in the camp, after a strict increase in arrivals during the summer, increased to more than 9,000 -- which is at all the same time the most.
He thought he was dead.
The Ulč crys himself and the Volleyball Orm.
"From March I could normally train," he reported at the launch of summer preparation in full strength.
What's wrong with you?
I had a two-sided pulmonary embolic embolism, and that's why I had heart problems.
Because when I was in Korean university, I didn't know I had some blood problems.
So the trouble caused a long flight to Asia?
I've had two years of screwing, and I didn't know about it.
It hurt me, nobody found me anything.
Then the collapse got upstairs.
There's a ruined vein in the litter, it'll be painful all the time, especially when it's done or weather changes.
But nothing that's limiting me, rather a estetical thing.
Did you worry about life?
I had to.
Last year, at the summer tournament in the woods, I didn't know I had an embolic embolic, and I couldn't move there at all.
I vomited blood tonight.
Doctors told me that it was something completely different, I was fixed for five more days.
I really thought I was dead in wooden, and my girlfriend and family.
I've seen you somewhere else.
How did you deal with it?
I guess I had to get through this, and now it's just going upstairs.
I know I have some blood problems, I have to watch myself more if I fly somewhere.
But you can do anything about it.
Only when I wanted to go back to preparing the Gate, there were still heart problems.
It's all right now.
Since March, I was preparing myself home to be able to play again.
I'll knock it, I'm physically better at it than before.
What do you expect from the Easter?
I'm looking forward to, the team looks good, most of the boys I know.
I'm curious about the other two strangers coming.
I hope we'll sit down in human, so we'll get this together.
Can you pick up the mouth?
There was a reputation of a freak, but every season is different.
Two years ago, the Brno was eighth, now the second ends.
There's a new team in Usto, just a few players left.
It was the last in extralision, so there's a big space to improve.
If we use it, it's on us.
We'll see who's going to be a freak after the first rounds, we don't.
Is the coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He's already experienced and experienced a lot, he'll think better than the last place.
But my arrival wasn't his, I made a deal earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, with one I'm a big friend, and it was agreed to work here.
I won't say the name.
Finally, Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
My big name, he was in good clubs, he trained a lot of dozen years, he's a former good player.
He'll move us up.
What are you bringing?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like fighting, I like joking, and I like getting an opportunity in a not such a top team.
I've been in Pribrama for two years, but the Ost is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned a stranger, an Australan Boehm is trained in Oste.
How does she look?
I know him in coincidence, we played against each other at the university in a group.
And a couple of times we've been there, and sometimes we've been sitting together tonight after the games, so we know each other as a friend.
We beat them 3:1 at the start of summer preparation in Oste.
He's got a Slovak girlfriend, he's a nice guy.
The American Nadazdin and the Brazilian Ze are on their way.
Do you know anything about them?
I've been writing with the American, looking like a nice boy, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
Did you contact the American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I'm a recorder, that's what I'm making, so I'm supposed to communicate with everyone.
I just figured out what the players were, I found it on the Internet, I saw some videos.
He was pretty cool, the boy jumps, he's high.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he'd come in with us.
How are you looking forward to the position of the recording unit?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm just going to get 40 and I'm not in the nature to do it.
I'd rather be in the center of the day, I'd rather run my team than someone else's leading him.
I guess I wouldn't want to play anymore if I had to be like the second recorder and spend the full time on it.
How many times have you been one?
Half a year in the Pribra, when Kust couldn't do it as a captain, he hurt himself, then there were money problems, and he left.
Since then, we've been up and I've been playing all the time.
In Brna, whom I am a disciple, I've been handling one and two.
The excellent year was in the Old City, and I had a lot of offers after it, and I just chose the Pribra.
From there I was wanted by Buddhejevice, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolic.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short pen remains Phelps' domain.
"Being again on the degrees of winners and hearing the hymna is sweet as always," he laughed at Phelps and had eyes full of tears again.
His fiancée and mother again screwed up in the sight, the son of Boomer this time calmly slept with the listeners on their ears.
I'm having an unreal week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago, I started swimming racefully and it'll be over in a few hours, he said touched.
At the Final of Phelps nearly two seconds, the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won a long pen.
Bronz won the Chinese Wang Schun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from the world's championship last year.
After Ala Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (daleko) is Michael Phelps the third sportsman who controlled the same discipline on four games behind him.
After the majority of the race, Phelps and the other American Ryan Lochte and the home of Thiago Perreira took place.
While the gold defender in the final fifty-fifth Crowlar set up for a rustling finish, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one chance to expand his unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the celebration of the site, he went to the final race at 100 meters of butterflies.
The legend could not shade Ryan Murphy, who won a signary double - after a hundred wins in Rio and a double track.
In the final, he left 37 hundred of the Australian swimming Mitchell Larkin, the third of the Russian Jevgeny Rylov.
While Murphy has only the fifth place from the world last year, in Rio he became the king of the Marketing King.
From the intelligent throne, Larkin, who did the same double in the world championship last year.
But he only got a medal right now.
Canadianka Penny Olexiac and American Simone Manuel shared the gold in a hundred Crowlars.
For 16-year-old Olexiac, it was the fourth medal on these games, for Manuel's second after silver from the bar.
She got a swimming gold on OH as the first African woman in history.
I believe I can be inspiration for others.
This medal is for all who come after me, the sports becomes love for them and they get where I am, the touched Manuel said.
The third was Sweden Sarah Sjöström, who wins a 100 - meter-med butterfly race in Rio.
When the sixth world recorder, Australian Cate Campbell.
The tissue wins Japanka Rie Kanet, for which it is the first Olympic medal in 17 years.
There is no valuable metal nor from the world's championship, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was acquired by Russia Julia Jefimov, who was facing the doping history with the nursery of the audiences and rivals.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should keep answering these questions.
I'm so tired of it, said Russian swimming.
The right to launch in Rio has been made to the special panel of the CAS sports arbitration just before the start of the games.
They were dealing with my appeal, and I won.
Whether anyone likes it or not, or if he has another opinion, whether he turns to the arbitration court, she added it.
Hermann: Disappointment, we could have won.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember that.
The Czechs have experienced a special day.
Just about an hour before the game, they found out who they're going against.
They must have managed a tactical preparation.
And then, in the untraditional time, the game started on a small kurt number one.
The first set didn't start well, then they pulled out the rivals, but at 19:19 they did not end.
In the second, they were clearly better and compared, but the decisive tie-break did not come to them.
First of all, a number of showed services meant a loss 10:15 and a goodbye with the Olympic tournament.
"We could have defeated the Russians," she regretted Hermann.
How would you evaluate the game?
Hermann: After the unfortunate start, before I was in the game, we got into a beautiful game.
At the end of the last balloon, I've lost the income I've used to.
We lost a hundred, which was key.
In the next set, we came to them with an overview on the field, another defense, and we pushed them on the service.
There's been a lot of distortions in the tie-break, and there we cleaned up on this page.
It was disappointment because we could have defeated the Russians.
It's a pity of the beginning of the first set, where we escaped.
We've been able to download it, but we've missed the bullets.
The second set was great, and in the third, the service was made up.
We've made a lot of mistakes.
We gave them five points, and about the five, we hesitated a lot.
It's a shame because the Russians were playable.
How'd you play at the small yard number one?
Lukova: Similar to China in the side courts.
The environment and the atmosphere were different.
There was one hour at night, total silence, music didn't play, nothing.
That was the difference against the center.
We wouldn't have chosen such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the game when you found the names an hour before the match?
Hermann: She was special.
We started to practice the game without knowing the counterplayers, so we couldn't make tactical preparations as for other teams.
But Simon (cut Nausch) prepared a tactics for almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of paperwork prepared with tactics, so we were pretty well prepared on this page.
Do you remember that you'd ever start a midnight match?
Hermann: I guess not.
We played at half the eleventh, but not at 12:00.
Block of Russian Birlov in the play-off front of OH in Rio.
Beach volaibalists Marketa Luková and Barbora Hermann in a hug in the predcolle play-off on OH in Rio.
Was it uncomfortable?
Lukova: By playing the last two matches in the group since ten, we had a regime moved before.
This was two more hours.
It's strange, I can't imagine another sport has sports who have to give their best performance at 12:00.
But I think we've prepared the best we could.
We knew it would be, but it's not typical, and it's probably not my favorite time to play.
How do you assess the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the process of the group was our target, it's on one side okay, good.
We did what we said.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
Luk: I'll sleep out of it, and since tomorrow, I'll only remember the Olympic tournament positively.
Big brother's here, the first SIM smuggling coming.
You won't escape her.
The new rules should apply to all persons without a Thai passport that decide to accommodate SIM from some of the local operators in Thailand when staying in Thailand.
Not only for tourists, but also for people with long - term visas, for example, working or closed marriages in Thailand.
The Secretary-General of the National Broadcast and Telecommunications Commission Takrn Tantasith informed that there would be no exception.
The SIM sales plan designed exclusively to foreigners presented a national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
The new measures to enable the monitoring of their location are intended to introduce the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasitha, it is a means to preserve national security that will enable a foreigner to deal with criminal activities.
Furthermore, the so-called tourist SIM should help to disclose persons who exceed the allowed length of stay.
For the salesmen, in six months, SIM should be presented by the Thaians only by the special SIM for foreigners.
The distinction will be the function of monitoring which will be permanently connected to the cards of persons designed without the Thai passport.
It's not gonna be possible to turn it off.
"This function in SIM is not for Thaians, because they can always be easily monitored," Tantasith added.
It is necessary to add that in Thailand, pre-payments are not anonymous as in Czech Republic.
The salesman requires a document of identity.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators was handing free SIM tourists on airports.
They were totally anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand also considers ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries including Malaysia or Singapore.
The SIM’s mandatory registration is currently applicable, however, the legal use of the monitoring system is not possible.
However, the preparatory measures do not mean that foreigners are obliged to acquire a local operator when entering the SIM country.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, so that the Thai authorities will be short to them.
For the operators of the country concerned after the cross-border border, that is, after the SIM login to their network, only relevant network information is known.
So they know the phone number, not the information about the owner.
Nevertheless, the difference in Roaming prices against local operators is so prolonged that even most tourists during their stay in Thailand will begin to look at local SIMs.
The efforts of the authorities to supervise the movement of foreigners by foreigners living in Thailand legally encountered immediate criticism.
Tantasith calms the situation and compares the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents as regards the protection of privacy.
In addition, the police will need a judicial order if necessary.
For any abuse of the system, the undetermined punishment will be threatened closer.
"If the service provider monitors the position of SIM without a court order, he will be accused of a criminal offence," Tantasith added.
The system should also maximize the use of pre-paid cards.
While a specific number is currently recycling until the 90-day period after which the SIM has not been reported to the network, the new renewal of Thailand could have occurred after 15 days.
The luxury apartment in the new building in the Winohrads has a pool and a terrace wreck.
Why did you choose a new building?
We've been looking for an immediate apartment where most of the real estate carries the manager.
The condition was enough parking sites and elevator in the house, which disqualified the senior building.
Not to mention the problemic akustics in old houses, problems with the scraping of the floor, high energy difficulty, and so on.
The condition was also a large terrace, which the old building is unable to offer.
For further interesting visits, see the magazine Modern apartment.
The entire interior proposed for you architect Lenka Langer with her colleague Camilou Polac from Artigo studio.
Why did you call them?
Would you recommend cooperation with an expert to everyone?
We would recommend collaboration with the architect to everyone, if he suggests an apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second plane is the design of the interior itself: designers have a significantly better idea of the scale of possible materials and on the basis of the customer's wish they are able to harmonize interiors properly.
With architect Lenka Langer, we have already cooperated on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of the other client's personal recommendation, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us even when we rebuild our new apartment in the Winohrads.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wished a generous social-residency space with a suitable ground for a four-member family concepted as a modern but not a cold interior.
The priority was to aim the link of the apartment with the terrace and to implement intelligent control of the household.
And, of course, it was necessary to cultivate the quality of the implementation.
Did you leave everything on the experts, or did you interfere with the final form of the interior yourself?
We have approved all proposals including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the proposal has always come from the architects.
At first, we decided what we expect from design, and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to include in the proposal, such as carpets or images.
I think that our collection mostly of the Czech authors includeing the works of Karl Malich, Karla Susila, Vaclava Spala or Otto Gutfreund architectics helped to orient ourselves in our taste.
Also a combination of black, white and nut tree was the idea of architect as well as a separate pieces of furniture, walls, floors, lighting, carpets, textilia, art etc. We checked together with visualizations.
Did some complications occur when you realized that you had to give up your original ideas, or are you going to join new ones?
Hopefully only in the introduction phase of the project, when we came to the building at the moment the first time it was possible to step up to our floors, and they found that the views we planned are actually shadowing the surrounding buildings.
Then we changed our disposition literally over the night from the base.
A jull was used on the kitchen line and on the clothing of the carpet wall.
In the interior, the wooden surfaces of the skin, such as the meal and bar chairs of Norm from Arper, are prevailing.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to change here or is there something you'd like to have different today?
I think it's a modern air interior that is mainly fulfilling its purpose.
We're not going to change, most of the adjustments after the relocation took place in the shadow and accommodation of terraces.
Hopefully the only lift is to the floor where the nut tree shows us as too hollow to house with a dog.
The word of architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langer and MgA. Kamila Hornich, authors of the implementation.
The apartment is in the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to complete new disposal solutions and several other adjustments within the building.
For the interior, it is an important element to place lightwaters in the corridor ceiling and the main bathroom.
That's how we got the darkest light in the darkest apartment.
The direct entry from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is also one of the construction adjustments which was very useful for the function of the entire apartment.
Part of it is also a pool and a squirrel.
In comparison with the French you are not negative, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live everywhere before you moved to Prague?
My parents are originating in Algeria.
I was born in southern France, a little bit from the Spanish borders.
I've been moving a lot.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, which led me to work in a magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was starting to feel like I was drowning in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere among people.
I thought every French was so negative.
People in France are generally negative, but it has been worse recently.
That's interesting that you're just mentioning negativeism.
Some people appreciate the nature of the Czech nature.
Believe me, in comparison with the French, you are not negative.
Some people may not come to France, because they don't feel so much as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
The big theme needs money.
People feel like they don't have enough money, while the minimum wages in France are 1500 euros, which I think is enough.
In addition, there is a problem with the behavior of people against the Muslims.
That's totally unacceptable for me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my unmuslim neighbor began to look at me with his fingers just because I was a Muslim.
It's like I'm some evil.
That's why I didn't feel well in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I've been looking for a job, basically, anywhere else, and I've met a free place at Air France's company here in Prague.
I admit I didn't know Prague from the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my dad even told me about what was happening in Czech Slovakia, but I didn't know what Prague would expect.
I've been here for three years, and I can't imagine I wouldn't live here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't catch any negative reactions or surgery, but I feel like people are more free here.
That I can do anything, get dressed anyway, and nobody's gonna judge me.
In France, someone's still looking at you unpleasantly, like when you have special clothes and stuff like that.
I started to feel really free in Prague.
I don't think the desired people care about such things.
Where are you working now?
After I worked in Air France for a while, I worked for one travel website.
Then we started with another friend the websites on which people offer and look for shared apartments.
We're only in Prague yet, but we'd like to expand this throughout Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are the Czechs of half, and two other Czech friends.
I have to say that another specification of the Czechs is that they keep their distances at first.
He's not going to let anyone get to his body right now.
That's quite the difference between where I grew up.
Everybody in the south hugs and kisses their faces.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural matter, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned you weren't talking Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, I'm pretty simple in Prague, because maybe everyone here speaks English.
Even at nights or foods.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have much time.
And by being able to communicate at least a little in English, I don't have that need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you met with any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a Muslim?
In fact, not.
Maybe it's also because I work in an international environment, which is more tolerant.
One experience I'm thinking.
My leader, Czech Republic, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense: 'Cause they're not French, they're Africans.
That pretty touched me.
But that someone might have a problem with being a Muslim, it hasn't happened to me yet.
Even though a colleague once warned me of some antimuslim demonstration.
He said I shouldn't go to the center, they're gonna put me there.
The anti-Muslim demonstration is partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Do you, for example, fear that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, it can happen anywhere today.
I may not have imagined that something like this would happen in France.
And it's not just about Muslims.
In addition, the Islam does not recognize violence at all.
For me, the killers aren't Muslims.
The Quran says that man has no right to kill because he's not God.
How do you feel when terrorists protect themselves by your faith?
It's very difficult.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way.
I'm trying not to follow the reports of violence much, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that isn't actually my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met at the Jeri Square of the Podbrads.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims and Christians demonstrated against violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know about it.
But I understand that people feel the need to prove that they disagree with violence.
I don't think they'd have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty about something they didn't cause?
Do you meet in Prague with other Muslims?
For example, my coworkers are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religiously founded than I do, so sometimes we have a pretty wild discussion about Islam, because we all take it a little differently.
I'm from France, so I've been through another education, maybe they've learned Islam in school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People of Islam sometimes connect to a woman's subject position.
How do you feel?
I don't think in any case.
It's rather the opposite.
I'm a woman, I'm strong.
It's also that you don't wear any head cover.
For example, Hijab?
And it's signed mostly the way I was raised.
For example, my mom is a really principled Muslim.
She prays five times a day, but she just doesn't wear her.
She always taught me that faith is a pure personal thing.
It depends on every way he interprets it.
When a man reads the Quran, he should make his own opinion on these things.
So when I read the passage in the Quran that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said, "I am not the prophet's wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect it, and when I travel to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the sheets require it, I will take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
Not yet.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but I'm great in Prague.
I can even imagine being raised here by my own children.
The threshold, I think, is an ideal city.
The Czech Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated against violence.
The Yachtage of Kozelski Fencl wind in Rio has fallen on the progressive lines.
The Friday sea ride in the Brazilian Rio de Janiero boarders Veronica Kozelska Fencl.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved before the final two rides to the tenth place.
That would make the Czech part of the final ride.
You collect packages like pokemones.
They want to compete with carriers.
The idea to use already planned shipping routes stands by the television director Mathey Liska and the manager of the Prague Music Club Marek Greger.
With the idea they inhaled the life of the three applications with a different geographical range.
We launched the Internal Transport Application in May.
At this point there are thousands of cities recorded in it and we'll expand the network.
In Czech Republic, we want to learn this first than we focus on abroad, says an 11-year-old manager in the interview for iDNES.
How does the transport applications work, and who can benefit from it?
You take it off and you'll register for free.
Then you can enter the route and data how much a large package you can transport and how much you want to do for it.
Someone might ask for a transport back that day.
When the route and the time of delivery meets, it is packed, and both of you will come in mutual notifications.
At that point, a chat will be opened, where the two are going to settle the dedication.
How many people do you think would have to register each package to always find a courier?
I don't know the ideal state, I can't guess how many registered and how many ways it takes to cover the whole optimum and every offer is compared with demand.
It's already working on the main tags, and it's logically easier than it's on the way between the villages.
The more people, the more speed and precision potential.
People also build confidence and find out that no one escapes with a package.
You haven't had to deal with this case yet?
How many users have the service after two months of launch?
Now, we have about 5 to 6 thousand people who make ways.
We consider it a success, and we believe that there will be others.
Doesn't it threaten that the sender will wait too long?
We hope that we will be competitive for great conglomerates because we are able to deliver this thing, like, for the same day and for a fraction of the price.
You'll pay a few thousand in a large company for delivery in two hours.
You're going to pay a hundred less here, because that's the way someone's already doing.
Should traditional carriers fear the possible loss of customers to the future?
We hope so.
The market has a huge potential, the huge transnational carriers are feeding here, as well as the trade chains where everyone started shopping and gradually found that quality is not responsible for what they are.
No one wants to find a ticket in the box with a message that he's going to pick up a shipment on the branch first that day after 19:00.
I needed a package for six hours, and I waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that won't wreck anyone and send a competitive signal to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matthew Liška (39).
None of them have ever worked in information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matthew Liss as a television director.
In 2014, Shippansee LTD started preparing the application, which uses to transport packages already planned roads between world metropolises, mainly by the aircraft.
In 2015, they introduced a project to process a company that created applications such as for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or CSFD.
The programming lasted three quarters and the application was marketed in March 2016.
Transport applications started to develop in December last year and issued this year in May.
This is the local version of Shippansee adjusted for the Czech market.
The moon and moon Profi have been developed since January this year and have been accessible to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was from the beginning to make all these applications that will be connected in one day.
In Czech Republic, they want the application to be completed, and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, they want to focus more on the world market.
The shared economy has recently been a subject and this is an airBnB or Uber service.
Do you not worry about the activities in the area where no one can tell much about yet where the boundaries of sharing are and where the grey economy is?
It's the same, just another product.
We understand that if it's going to succeed and we go up with it, we're going to be another trunk in the eye through the gray economy.
But even though someone saves and earns, it is not intention to circulate financial authorities and tax controls.
Each user, either on one or the other side, will be encouraged to give his income if it makes income.
Why do you think the service has such a great potential?
The sender saves and the carrier earns, respect reduces the costs of the journey.
That's the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
At the time of the social networks that people divide, we would like this one to get closer.
They can come up with nice stories, people are happy to help someone and talk about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
According to me, people have been missing personal access for a long time, and we say this application is a service for people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier with a package doesn't run away?
Each application user, along with the registration, scans the civil card and sets out a bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are channels that give the service and the person the credibility.
Couriers also collect stars based on sender assessments.
We're offering insurance, we're still making details.
For an unsustained shipment in the case of loss or damage, the courier shall not take responsibility under the criminal law if there is something illegal inside and not aware of it.
If the police stop him and find him in a closed package in his cartridge or ten kilos of a hashish, it's overwhelming the criminal responsibility of the sender.
Doesn't the use of sensitive data from the database threaten?
They are registered, if necessary, by the supervisory authority, which as the only one will have the possibility to look into it, and we are not able to see them, data are protected against abuse.
How much money does the courier get after the successful delivery of the shipment in his hand?
The courier determines the price and gets the whole amount he says.
The sender shall be charged with several percent further for the mediation of the contact.
These money are our profit, but it's just a few percent because we want to push on the volume.
The courier, too, can't blame that he didn't deliver the shipment when he actually delivered it, the take-up and delivery is verified using QR codes.
Are there any limitations?
Either in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can carry anything.
We have three sizes, small as a bone of butter, middle like egg plato and large as a bass beer.
Then there are no further restrictions, and if someone has a place in the car, he can carry a refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has a possibility to photograph the package in the application, so the courier can see what he wants.
You don't even need to pack if you don't want to hide the content exposed.
You put the forgotten mickey in your hand to the courier, and that's it.
Who came with the idea, and how long did the service take?
A friend got a idea more than two years ago, and then I didn't pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me the demo of an application with an overnational reach, which targets mostly the travelling plane.
At that point, I told him I'm not gonna look for an investor, but I'd like to become him and put me in savings.
The next year the development took place than we found a Shippansee LTD in London for the greater credibility of the product.
But this is not the version you're focusing on now.
No, we focused marketing on Czech Republic, where we're trying to catch the application because it all had birth pain, and it's still what to solve and improve.
We are trying to respond to the reverse liaison from customers and the foreign market we are not dealing with much at the moment.
We know it's a long run, but we don't want to, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive applications, two other were upgraded in their way.
The transport came when we thought that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn in Czech Republic.
The third application of the Moon is local for the city.
But he can send a package to a precise address to the second end of the world.
It works for the sender as well as the Transport, but the difference is that you see shipments in it as a courier in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in your mobile.
The courier's applications that want to eat, we called the Messenger Profi.
So someone can earnestly make money by picking up packages around the city?
Exactly, the latest application takes off in Prague, like a taximan, a student, a mother at a parent's vacation, someone who wants to get his way to work.
As everyone's stupid with those pokemoni now, they can gather this exactly the same thing.
A man sees where there are procurements in the city, comes to it, clicks and sees when it has to be delivered and delivers the shipment.
It's set cheaper than competitive services.
At this point we're doing more web interfaces that will be difficult for shipping companies, they will fill in information on them on the web, or create points on the map.
Then we are capable of using their service each month.
Do you now devote the project to a full job?
It's exhausting, but we normally have this in employment so that we can feed and develop the project.
There's no strong transnational investor behind us, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped into it with other incentives and ideas.
We are now looking for an investor strong enough to manage us to cooperate with us, not with the Czech market, but who should, with the excuse of the balls, go with us to the world product and become another huge market player like AirBnB and Uber.
The story part of Titanfall 2 is to bring a so-forgotten pestrost.
This will fix the second part and the solo game in it will be stronger according to the first information than in Call of Duty.
The length will be moving around the standard eight hours and the filling shall be based on the concept of network fuel in the first part.
It is therefore possible to look forward to the freedom of movement, which includes the possibility to use a fighting titan.
In addition to the action passages, the game will contain levels focused on the reverse movement.
They'll be reminded of the platforms and include the ripples.
Their overcome is therefore essential to the coupling of double jumps, running around the walls and the lane slip.
In addition, sometimes it will be necessary to eliminate enemies.
There will be no maps that look like a fortune and levels with special concepts.
For example, it will be possible to raise and move the platforms and close powerful doors.
That's how you're going to be the form of a battlefield.
The pace of the game should therefore oscillate between the violent action and the more calm moments for the exploration of an unknown planet.
We're gonna play Jack Cooper's walker dreaming about a pilot's career.
Cooper at the beginning of the campaign, together with Captain Lastimos, will break down on the alien planet of Tyhon, which are hostile soldiers.
And there won't be any wilderness in there.
Furthermore, Lastimosa will break deadly wounds in the crash, and Cooper will be given as an assignment to carry out the captain's titan.
His dream of a pilot's career will come true sooner than he expected.
But the first step will be to steal the battery necessary for robot repair.
Cooper's calls with a titan will also be important.
It serves to the players as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time, the robotic individual communication will be accompanied by humoral moments.
For example, when the titan will emphasize all the injuries that Cooper is threatening at the planned exhibition.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 brought the Polygon server.
Furthermore, the result will be possible to assess in two months and Bonusweb will bring you the first impression from the network game.
Titanfall 2 comes out on October 28th, for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ mark will be alive, but original publishing remains dead.
Swedish Nordic changes the name to THQ Nordic.
After the failure of the THQ issue in 2013, she received a number of its marks and the right to use the logo and the name of the company.
For example, the Nordic issued Darxiders 2 Deatgnitive Edition or the Red Faction Collection package.
Furthermore, the company has not yet discovered another 23 games for publishing.
Thirty years ago, at the time I retired, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found a 20 - year - old man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning -- first she obviously tried for a long time, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she was walking with a similar guy in front of me.
She's totally mad at him.
In those first days, even her voice changed, she had such a girl, a loved voice.
But when I told her I know what's going on, she denyed it.
But I've been watching it all.
He walked from work at half a quarter, so she always left at three for shopping.
She tried to see him every day.
Later, I figured they were meeting at his house in the laundry room.
How many times I knew they were right there.
I got my keys, I was determined to catch them there.
But I don't know why, finally, I've always been sitting at home.
I've never been able to go there, to make that decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife controlled me in mind.
Soon, I think she found out that I'm controlling, I'm going to do what she wants.
And I really did it.
Maybe I'm just like that.
And then the neighbors suggested that they knew it.
I was such a fool that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all broke out, it would be bad.
That in the family, it's just a daughter.
So I've always postponed it, keep going and go.
But once I went to his apartment to need some help in the washing room.
He went there with me, and I told him I got anonymous, that he was meeting with my wife, and that he's proofing everything.
I asked him what he'd say about it.
He stood there, cried his shoulders, looked into the ground and said no word.
Then I also met his wife once on the way from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond, and she also didn't tell me anything.
No one told me that time.
I'm a man who never went anywhere, having a problem meeting someone, finding a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I've always relied on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her all this and life's going on.
That's not what it was.
And I've never dealt with all this in fact.
I still have it in me.
I used to show it to her quite often, but I left it for peace.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just more than my wife's housekeeper.
She always did everything at home -- cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's working.
I think she was always trying to make me have no other reason to complain.
And you can say she's even good.
But sometimes I'd like to hug her, hug her, and she won't let her go.
We go on walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks what a happy marriage we have.
But she once told me she never loved me.
That she loved and loved me, but she didn't love me.
And I see that he loves him so far, it's her god.
And I'm not tired of life like that.
When it started and I was wearing it very badly, I once told her she didn't want to live and I asked what she would say if I finished it.
I wanted to know if she'd agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her, yes or not.
But she thought, and finally she said, "But there's enough place."
Prime Minister Manuel Vals wants to establish a new French Islamic foundation that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim residents.
After terrorist attacks, France is increasing the fight against radical Islamic and the government and the local Muslim minority are calling for assistance.
"If the Muslims themselves do not help the State against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom of their confession," Prime Minister Manuel Vals said.
It will ensure that only spiritual education in France is preached in the country.
He also wants to stop the funding of abroad mixtures, when money often comes with preachers intensified by Gihád.
By October, Prime Minister Valles wants to establish a new French Islamic Fund, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim residents.
The new institutions will replace the current French Fund for Islam, which was established by the Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
It should have contributed to the transparency of financial flows between meshites and countries that have funded their construction.
Soon, however, it was affected by internal disputes, and that's why it never worked well.
"It's a total failure," said Valls.
The new foundation will appear to be the former Minister of Interior and Defence, Jean-Pierre Chevènement, known as the secular state.
In France, approximately 2500 meshites and prayer, some 120 of them serves a radical islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities have expelled about 80 Islamic clergymen from the country and consider this step in several other dozens.
This week, the German police also strike against the hyhadist spirits.
The Immas reportedly recruited warriors for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a place where believers reportedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Right after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the debate on a new institution in France was exhausted, which would replace the non-functional foundation.
All the other terrorist attacks were speeded up in the name of the Islamic State, radical Islamists.
The new foundation will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of meats from domestic resources, and also to supervise the property.
But it is not yet clear where he gets funds, although several proposals are considered.
One of them is a special fee for food hall, especially for the meat of defeats in accordance with the Islamic principles.
This tax would be paid in practice by the sellers to hall food for granting permission.
Part of the money would then travel to the budget of the foundation.
The contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by the French passengers who go to Mekka.
Each year, some 30,000 people leave for a traditional trip to Saudi Arabia.
In addition, only preachers who went through educational programmes in the local universities should work in the French mess.
Thus, their preaching should be in line with democracy.
The government also closes radical bags.
"We closed twenty of them since December, and the others will follow," the Minister of Interior Bernard Cazeneuve said.
"There is no place in France for those who report hatred and disrespect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was severely injured by an unknown shooter on Friday morning at the Shopping Center in Northern Spain Zaragoze, writes the Independent Journal.
The shooting happened after the woman and daughter left the garage spaces in their car.
The man waited in the car before the shopping center, where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, a man then turned his gun against himself, writes Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital with an injured daughter, and an ambulance had to come for a man in critical condition.
At about 11:00 a.m. in the center of the metropole autonomous area of Aragonia, near the local university.
With appealing to the Spanish agency Europe Press writes the Independent that the motive was probably an unsolved recent divorce of both partners.
We're waking up the squirrels, we're waking up with sandwiches, and chilli sauce.
Summer wishes light, well-food food, but we are the Czech rebels and we have our tastes and our heads.
So the summer barbecue smells roasted throats, squirrels, pigs.
Nothing very healthy, nothing very light, yet sometimes except salad or baked vegetables.
True, barbecue is savings for time and dishes, in addition, it is a social matter and no one has to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives, how to make it a good thing, which is a special store, their preparation represents a small ritual, but there is nothing longer to cook, bake, bake, or choke.
And they will also contribute to our health.
Whether it is necessary for home sushi or sashimi, where quality raw materials and a few well conquered griffs will be sufficient to make preparation entertainment and food itself a real exotic flavor.
Just like even easier rolls in the rice paper from today's recipe.
It even drops out of time more difficult cooking and rice cooling.
The paper can only be softened into the water for a moment and then it depends only on the cook's fantasy, how she's going to play with fillings and supplements.
It's not like an arc.
The benefit of a number of Asian kitchen foods is that raw materials are generally available today.
Inclusively loaded sweet acid barrel, which is one of the basic tastes of sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but the right pink gari barrel has a unique pixant sharp, and at the same time a nice taste by a secret reception that mixes it from several types of octa and grapes.
It is therefore enough to buy a bag corresponding to the size, and the annex with proven antibacterial effects, which supports consumption and resistance to cough or grip, is complete.
Banana leaves.
In particular, they are used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in the service and decoration of foods within the various celebration opportunities and rituals.
The long beauty leaves are very widespread in a number of countries of Asia or South America as well as "help" for the preparation of various baked, cooked and baked foods that are packed in them as in the alobal.
The banana sheet then gives the food a specific taste.
They can be purchased in sales with exotic fruit and vegetables, even in advance cut into the form of wheels.
But choose only the leaves of the green, and therefore healthy, unbreakable and unfreaked.
Similarly, the preparation of a wakame salad, sesam and sesame oil is easy.
Because it can be bought freezed again.
Who often or prepares her sushi, will probably know the arc of nori.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of marine salts, from which it is produced by cutting, licking and drying so-called leaves of nori - so pays for the production of sushi.
Wakame – a dark green sea growing in waters around the island of Hokkaidó – it is also fresh and dry and is as popular as a fountain.
By the way, who wouldn't know the soup of the wakame soup, Asian women reportedly use it for a long time after birth recovery.
And at all, this sea has almost miraculous effects.
Clean blood, strengthens the blood circle, even reportedly prevents hair greying and is literally loaded with minerals.
Dried and crushed wakame also serves as spices, such as taste of rice.
Fresh altars first leave in the water, then float, put in warm water and half minutes cooking.
Then it cools in the ice water, cuts the middle ribs and continues to be edited as a favorite salad.
Of course, buying it is already finished, frozen, it's the easiest solution.
So it's just to wrap a roll with easy vegetable filling, flattering, and light, full of healthy tastes.
That's a long-term bomb.
If you resist and don't throw a barbecue more.
Eat yourself healthy, easy and summerly.
The Asians know how to do it.
A couple of special raw materials and a little skill, and you have an interesting fresh food that tastes deliciously.
And it's done once two.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g carrots, 40 g white rare, 100 g green corn, 60 g salad corn, 60 g wakame and 60 g sweet chilli sauce.
Thumbs of a soccer coriandrome, black season spoon, scarf chilli sauce, 20 g manga and 40 g loaded gari brand, a little pini nuts.
Let's get the wrappers ready first.
We'll wet the rice paper for five seconds into cold water.
Then we'll take him out and wait for him to get soft.
Meanwhile, in the hot water, we'll cook the baptisms shortly, about three minutes later, we'll cool quickly into the ice water so they can not lose the color.
We'll put a vegetable filler on the paper permitted and pack it.
We'll make the filling out of white rare, corn and salad corn that we're cutting on soft powders, mixing them with a sweet chille with a sauce, adding a cut coriandra, mixing thoroughly and putting it on a rice paper.
We'll put the banana leafs on the banana sheet, add the whirlwinds, and at the end, we'll decorate the whole food with a wakame, loaded with a wackage, with a manga plate, we'll swallow a black season, and add a couple of pini nuts.
Britain must be satisfied with silver in the seventh rugby, the choice of Fiji takes gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain in the seventh football ended by a destructive stop on the last obstacle, Fiji defeated at the final match on Thursday night British at Deodoro stadium here in Rio high 43:7.
The Fijians showed a championship lesson in processing, puzzle, whispers, support games, run on line and brutal forces - and gained gold, their first Olympic medal at all.
The defeat came with an unprecedented price of comfort in the form of a silver medal - for Britain the third day - and the British could be at their performances in the inaugurative Olympic tournament of the seventh footby, defeated New Zealand, Argentina and the South African Republic.
The victory of South Africans 7:5 in the semifinal the same day, may be frozen in the final.
However, Fiji would also beat the 15-member team in full health in its form.
It may not be a comfort for the British, but they may be pleased that at least one of them will have a gold medal around the neck tomorrow: the chief trainer of the Fidjan is Ben Ryan, former head of England of Wimbledon.
Great Britain has injured a piece of road.
Eight years ago, Ryan's leaders lost every match in Adelaide Sevens.
They've lost the only one here.
This defeat hurts, but progress is unsupportable.
Fiji began greatly, the entrances of the British reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other players, it was like running around a number of buses in the motion and the championships of the world cup led 5:0 when Osea Colinisau came out behind the corner.
The timelight showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which it was conversion.
12:0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
Great Mitchell tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring a third, but only he slowed down the Fidjans.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw a dotdown in the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another after returning and the hours still remained more than one minute... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravuwa then broke through the small Britains and landed on the crap where he scored.
After conversion at state 29:0, there was a break.
It was like Fiji was born for football 7s, while the British were still learning to transmit.
That's exactly what it's like.
The British after half the time made a bunch of changes and the Fijani's effort stopped... for four minutes, which was good in comparison with the first half, until after the brilliant game of Fiji Josua Tuisova continued.
Dan Norton tried to gain an opportunity for the British, threw touchdown into the left corner to increase an 36:7. The match has already won the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands and their fans singing, waving with flags and dancing.
It was hard not to admire the entirely excited approach of the Fijans.
In the final moments, Mata Viliam made another attempt to win the Fijians sweetened.
The whistle called, the Fijians hugged themselves, and the British fell on the grass totally down.
Even before the same day, Fiji defeated Japan 20:5 in the semifinal, and Great Britain conquered the South African Republic in a close semifinal - the difference between one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the first half-time leadership, but Dan Norton, thanks to his shiny work, broke the defense line and scored in the second half-time under the hook.
The great late puzzle of Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother from the fifteenth team of England, secured victory -- and finally a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired a coach fight with cancer to win in the Veslarian race.
You can't find more emotional gold on these Games - and that's what to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 penal exhibits in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another significance in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Even though there were two joys sitting in the boat, there were three votes. When the ship swished on the level to the second Olympic gold behind him in the race of women's couples, there was still a voice in the boat of still present coach Robin Williams. They were the first women in the history of the British sport that reached such a result.
Their advantage was absolute, totally their 39th race in which they remained unbearable.
What we see - two excellent athletes flying on the water level with the elegance of the swan - does not reflect the nature of victory completely.
For each gold medal of the vesslovation, there is a battalion of helpful hands, which part after a piece means the difference, and no hands were helpful more than the coach's hand 30 months ago, who didn't know if he would survive this day when the cancer was found.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I suffered the cancer of the urine bubble that could be surged, and I took this operation.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It's going to change your view of things somehow.
The cancer was found to Williams in December 2013.
Happy for the whole trio was that he could have started the treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, and reduced the fall to the minimum - if we can call it in such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together quickly.
That was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time they said a few steps were enough.
That's how it started.
Speaking about yourself is a way, but this was a lot more difficult.
Right after the victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, spoke less than usual, as he tried to handle his own disturbance.
Stanning, a colonel of the royal artillery, who has a mission in Afghanistan, said: “I was with emotions on the bottom this week, perhaps a little extreme, but that means so much. ”
It emphasizes how much it means to me how much we worked with Helen and Robin, too.
Until now, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be nobody, so it belongs to a great thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't wish a better person for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose the only race in five years.
Two of them put in an amazing rhythm that their rivals couldn't succeed.
Even in the final 500 meters, when the new Zealand and Denmark crews were approaching, Stanning had a very large reserve with Glover.
We were focused at the moment.
Helen shouted, "Do not stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to be abducted.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to achieve something famous.
We weren't looking forward to the fireworks today, we just wanted to hang well, go out and win the race, which we did.
He takes a year to think before he decides what's going on.
Glover is marrying next week, her current TV adventure is Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to find out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It makes me feel much better," she said.

Prison?
Rather, let them ride people for free, the taximan says Rubeš to a breakdown charge.
Six taxiers and former magistrate officer in Prague are, as the CT stated, accused.
You have recorded a number of reports in which you have discovered the fraud practices and those who are to be in the group to be in court.
You've been facing a few unpleasant fights with discovered actors.
How much is the accusation report of the members of the organised group broken for you?
I was expecting it to happen to some court.
I'm most curious about the judgment.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
That's nothing.
I mean, primarily, they should get all the money stolen.
And they should be returned by driving all the people for free.
That's a little different solution.
Does this mean that you do not consider the possible punishment as sufficiently effective?
It's enough for me that some of them are so afraid that they don't do this job anymore.
For example, one makes a pingla, another takes off the pizza, and one is totally out of it.
Prosecutors can teoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think that's an adequate rate?
I generally have a problem with liberation.
I think it's a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in such a case, is bullshit.
Such people should return the company they took her.
For the fourth century, they did that they destroyed our country’s name and completely robbed people.
So let's make a good card now and unload people for free.
I can't imagine anything else.
It would work as a publicly useful work.
As someone's going to gather waste, they'd get a car, and they'd drive people in Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll finally get the condition and they don't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Film Academy Miroslav Ondric in the Sand and then at the University of Tomasa Bati in Zlina.
It belongs to people who in the Czech Republic started with viral videos and videos directly for the web.
He works as a editor for Internet TV Stream.cz, where he is participating in a number of series, is now preparing Prague Guide show, which is primarily designed for foreign watchers.
Rubesh advises them to avoid what services in Prague, and recommends to use without worrying.
He used to film a series with names How for that, City of frauds?, Life in luxury, And enough! and Prague against Coins.
They are spoken as organized group in the prosecution.
She's been tracked by the police for months.
Can a network of cheating taxiers be called a mafian?
They're such cute mafias, not the ones we know from Kmotra.
It's more about juniors, but they're organized.
It's just that they're watching each other's stairs.
The threshold's all broken.
I tracked that, for example, the main station is unlikely with Paris, Paris does not like taxiers waiting at Karls Laznia (disco club)
Everyone's just watching the place, and every group is kind of organized.
It's apparently the connected network.
However, only seven people, six taxiers and one former magistrate officer who warned the driver from control.
As you say, the undesirable phenomenon of the streets did not disappear.
So what is the percentage of the parish fraud in the taxi service, according to your estimate?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still.
For example, I'm talking about Alesh Ryjatch.
It's a man who's really dangerous - in his car he drives a telescopic armor, and every Friday and Saturday stands at Karl's bridge and rides people.
The last time I drove with him, he wanted seven hundred miles away from me.
His police for some reason didn't hold it.
They only chose a few people from this big group.
The same situation is, of course, in other areas of Prague.
Thus, seven people are difficult to erase the famous Prague neshwar, which is apparently much larger.
Of course, it's nothing.
It's gonna help, but all evil doesn't wipe out, that's true.
Are taxiers stealing foreign tourists still in the same places you showed in the press, Karlov bridge or Paris Street?
Yeah, that's right.
In these places they stand every day and they break the statements every day.
It ignores both the city police and the Prague magistrate.
It's not even cat anymore, it's total indifference.
Business of Prague taxiers in numbers
Still, some of them, which is only a part of the group, will be judged.
It's already a breakdown.
So I have to ask, do you feel satisfaction?
If I took it as a satisfaction, it would be bad, because my goal was, it was, and it would always be to make the center of Prague better.
And even if I feel like it's going to be a little better, I'll continue to do it.
You need to push the door on the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we still have to do something to remove him.
You can't satisfy that.
But it's not like that, of course there's more of them.
Are you still trying to confront them directly in the cabs?
Sometimes I'm doing test drives, and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week I caught a taximan, by the way of the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three miles, although he then claimed that it was a amount of 56 crowns (used a trick with a decimal line).
He had an assumption, the cops arrived, and this cab was so cutely irritating that he was still going to see those cops and asked them when someone finally gave him those 56 crowns.
Similar case.
A taxi driver on the taxameter lifted a dozen-point and robbed tourists by 357 crowns.
Can it be said that the anger of cheating taxiers did not step down even after you showed the faces of those who accounted for nonsense amounts for a short ride?
Their anger is still incredible.
How did this taxi driver get 56 crowns?
The cops sent him away with the fact that they couldn't discuss with him in place because he exposed the account.
And that's, I think, the problem with that court (six taxiers and one executive).
On the one side there will be a taxi driver with his accounts on the other side of the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice, the master shall not use secret recordings from the taxi service vehicle as evidence in the court.
When I filmed pieces about their frauds, the cabs myself warned me about this precedens.
But I've always wanted to use it for the press.
Are you worried that this reality could protect them from the court?
I hope every judge understands that no taxi driver could ride in six or ten crowns per mile because he wouldn't eat it.
You talked about a trick with a decimal line, which, in particular, before foreign customers, fake taxiers move.
Is it still current, or are they concerned about this fígl after the publication of your reporting?
I think this trick we've popularized by the broadcast show.
I've recently driven a taxi driver, praised in front of me that he was the honest taxi driver.
But then I noticed that on the side of the taxameter a black sticker.
When I asked him what he had there, he said, "You know what it is."
If the taxiers didn't work too much on the penalties, can the court with their colleagues have a warning effect on them?
Is there anything that can distract them from fraud?
You've talked about the way you think they'll always find their way to cheat.
I don't think anything can distract them.
But someone can push them out of these places.
And these are fair taxiers who should fight more to get them out of there.
From my experience, I have to say that fair taxiers in Prague, fortunately, overcome these.
But do they want to go against those who ruin the reputation of their servants?
They taste, but they miss their mind.
They don't know how to walk, and they can't say exactly what they want.
When the demonstration was arranged (for a proposal for general restrictions from the office of Primator Adriana Krnačová), it was not very clear what they wanted.
Once they said they didn't test against Uber that they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then they claimed that they wanted more than Uber.
It just happened to block Prague, and it just came from the best possible Uber ads.
How do you totally evaluate access to the Prague magistrate in addressing the problem of driving?
It's obvious that the criminal police had to get into it to solve something.
The magistrate was short for it.
They had a mole who was making information there, which means that the taxi department had been doing their job for a few years completely unnecessary.
I hope that the official will be charged to the last check of all the wasted checks to realize what he did.
That's the worst thing I've ever seen.
I've even been on one control ride with him, which I've learned until then from their schedule.
Since the publication of the last parts of the series, it has been a few months.
What's the response?
I mean, mostly with foreign audiences, before the series is actually the most focused.
Every time I've got friends from abroad, I'm letting them play the videos.
And when we go after the Stardomist Square, they're surprised that the same people that see in the videos are really standing.
A famous Prague celebrity.
But I'm serious.
I'd build a plates around them so people can look at them.
Museum of Communism on the street.
My last question is clear.
You ride a cab when you need it?
Sure.
I ride with services where I don't have to pay cash, but with a card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are many dispatches that are fair.
I've only taken a cab on the street since then.
The driver said, "Well, you have the courage."
Bem in the dressing for an Italian tourist.
The fraud practices of taxiers were already written in 2005.
The former primator Paul Bem went to the same year to a control ride in the dressing of an Italian tourist and immediately on his first attempt, his driver screwed up for two hundred.
The editor Rubesh had worse experience.
The taxi drivers charged him for a ride from Staremistsky to the Václav Square 820 crowns, which is up to about 195 crowns per mile, as the creators calculated.
The Prague magistrate set the maximum price of 28 crowns per mile.
There are also other surprising amounts in the photographed report: for example, a two-mile road from Parisian Street to Truhlarska standed tourists 400 crowns.
The expensive rides were also provided by taxiers waiting at the Karl Bridge.
For the journey to an angel of 2,5 miles, they account for six hundred crowns.
Mramor is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and the longer, the better.
The uncleanness goes well, even though sometimes the dirt has to be put down by scalpel, it is necessary to expand it from the perpetrators.
It's not easy and it's not fast, it's closer to her job, Vanessa Trostová from Oldrichov in Hayah.
The hat down in front of her: the grave is constructed by a scratch, after which you need to climb and get down a lot of times.
"The restaurant should be careful, patient and unanimous for the work environment," she said.
It's not her first restaurant work in Friedland.
For example, the reconstruction of the stone elements of the fasada in the back tract of the frydlant council, also restored St. Mary Magdalena in Tish, Saint John Nepomucki in Fridlanta, Pieta in the Fridlant District Street, the Marian column in Fridlant, or atlants in the bath in the New City under Smurk.
With the renewal of the nadgrobek Melchiora, Krysztofa and Katerina from Redern, it started in Fridlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements from the harvest of filthy and crusts, the released stone parts shall be secured against the fall and the movement; either they will be coated into the wall or to each other.
They are also waiting for treatment and preservation of the surface.
The signs on the grave will be re-pollated.
"Then it begins by staring signs on the marbleboards with filthy gold," stated the State Memorial Care of the City's Office in Fridlant Vera Saturday.
There are no records from the past that the grave is going through some repairs.
When they look closer, they capture the holes that are ripped in the marble columns.
They're hundreds of years old and it's about the remains after the grave.
He was richly decorated, unfortunately, after the Swedish invasion during the Thirty-year War, everything disappeared.
They literally broke the grave, Saturday noted.
In the church, the Holy Cross findings are restauranters with a slight overtake like home.
After the flood in 2010, the graves that found themselves under water were needed to be arranged, the baptism, the wall paintings in the grave and now the grave.
"We would also like to go into the vitrage in the future," Sabota said.
The church is differently in a very good condition, each year we invest money in maintenance and repairs.
Restaurant work on the renewal of the Redern nadgrobek will come totally to 128,000 crowns.
They will be saved with funds, the city will not invest any of its money in this part of the renewal.
A hundred thousand crowns will come from the victory in the circuit of the historical town in 2015, the remaining 28,000 crowns then the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, stated Mayor Frydlant Dan Ramzer.
Release of the victory for the restoration of the grave has been decided by the representative.
The views of experts on future development on selected foreign markets monitored by indexes and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) in the horizont of one month and a half of the year.
Low volatility and growth are prevailing on the markets.
Who would have said that in the beginning of the year.
The American S&P500 index, which passed 12% of the corrections today is on a new historic maximum and has already been 7 percent since the beginning of the year.
Again, the iron rule is confirmed that traders should never go against the interests of central banks, which have finally achieved their own.
In the situation where American shares are at historic maximum, again disappears volatility, which is currently low since 2014, where markets have grown satisfactorily and without fear thanks to the quantitative release of the US Central Bank, and where, like today, the volatility index (VIX) has been maintained stablely under the limit of 12 per cent.
And not too.
Although the Fed markets continue to prepare for a progressive increase in interest rates, quantitative relevance in Europe and Japan is in full stream and has attached its hand to the work of the Bank of England, which will buy debts in the amount of 70 billion pounds in the next six months.
The new wave of quantitative relevance thus pushes so low profits even below and contributes to almost complete elimination of the risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
Of course, that's a question for a million.
But there are no risks at the moment, the world's economy is going through nearly constant growth without more demands, the situation on the commodity market and in China is stabilized and brexing is not in fact the subject, so we probably should not be too surprised if the American stock continues to last in a peaceful regime.
Too bad Juncker isn't studying Klaus!
I am very glad my friend Michel Barnier accepted this important and difficult task.
I wanted for this difficult work of an experienced policy, said the chief of the European Commission, Juncker, when the French politics (really experienced, because exploited by so many different transnational political functions that the better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to seek) has appointed the European Commission's main negotiator for leaving the EU.
Juncker's choice has emphasized the hope that it is in the serious interest of the EU to seek with Britain the form of future friendly coexistence.
But most British media accepted Barnier's name as Juncker's war act.
Barnier is a rocked European federalist.
Great Britain hates it.
As the Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was responsible for reform of European banking law.
It was bound as only he could capture it: an enemy of the English concept of the free market and the model of capitalism.
The supporter of multilateral regulations was a co-autor of the concept of the so-called Banking Union and incorporated against everything that originated in the London financial centre of City, has introduced the legislation overwhelmedly tough regulations of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the controversy with London, will be a hard, unbreakable and obviously irrelevant negotiator.
That's probably not good news.
How to not remember the peaceful and friendly division of the Czech Slovak Federation, which has contributed so much to reasoning, review and empathy of Prime Minister Václava Klause.
Thus, today the Czech Republic can be the closest friends and allies.
It's a pity Juncker from Václava Klause - at least in this - hasn't learned.
It would be for the good of everyone!
Earthquake around Putin?
The Master of Kremlu released his close Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivanov from the President's office on Friday.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno.
The Russian media informed it by appealing to the notification of the Kremlu press service.
Putin indicated that Ivanov was released on his own request.
During the meeting that Rosian 24 television station transmitted, the president said that Ivanov was in line with his wishes to be head of the presidential office for up to four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The exchange report of the President's administration, which is now led by Ivanov's present representative Vajno, is considered relatively surprised.
Ivanov, 63 years old, is appointed as one of the closest employees of Putin.
For example, this former officer of KGB in the past was standing for the ministry of defence and vice-presidents of the government.
He will now leave the chair of the President's Security Council.
Ivanov at the meeting with Putin, however, stated that the length of continuation in the administration of the Chief of State is actually a recordman.
He's been in it for four years and eight months.
In this regard, he recalled that 11 people had already been treated in this function in 25 years since it was established.
The quit or the debris of Uncle will not play the finals.
So far, none of the Friday tennis fights have been converted into final participation.
First of its battle, Peter Quit, who was subjected to the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puig after the sites 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
Even the Czech deblishers Shafariva and Uncle followed the quote after a while.
Even though Williams’ sisters' killers in the first set hit the win, they wasted two stumbles, and the Russians eventually took advantage of a set in a shorter game.
The second set then lost the ratio of 4:6.
Half success in the morning program in Rio recorded the Czech verbation: skifar Ondrej Synek won its semifinals with a review when the second Damir Martin from Croatia defeated even after the release in the conclusion of almost a second.
Good today, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as possible, said Son.
His rivals, unlike him, had to fight for the process.
So it took them some powers, so it could be easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's gonna be easy, it's just playing on my cards, said the Vessel of Prague Ducla.
Mirka Topink-Knapk, but she didn't walk in Snyk's footsteps.
Fifty-fifty-year-old veslaur hired the fourth position in today's semifinal in her ride, and on Saturday, she was waiting for the start of the B final and the fight by 7 to 12 place.
Honey from London, they don't defense it like that.
For the first time, I didn't go to the final.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I've been running a qualitative race, and I've put everything in it.
The competitors were just better. Topink Knapk's leaning in front of them.
She fought until the end and believed that she would get in her fourth games between the elite six.
The fight gave up just before the target.
I knew the girls were balanced, that anyone could come out of this field.
I was surprised the Chinese woman had such a finish.
And I thought I'd be able to get to the final.
Unfortunately, today the life race, said the world's champion of 2011.
Far behind the final gates in Rio, a young shooter Philip Neichal, who never managed to get out of qualification this time, the painting in the bed.
It's the place of 33th.
The qualifications were better than the Russians.
From the first line, Sergej Kamenski came with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628,9).
Neichal's shot was 620.5 points.
Athletes also spoke to the Rio program for the first time, including the Czech seven-boyers, Katerina Cach and Eliška Klučinová.
Cachs belong to the second discipline of the Olympic Competition 11th place, Czech recorder Eliška Klučinová is twenty-two.
Britta Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 cm, as the second Belgian Nafissato Thiam.
Both have taken care of history of the best high-level performance in the seventh battle.
They tried to jump 201 inches, but they failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
When we look away from absurdity of this question, the German company has suffered a deep self-reflexe, whereas Russian is not.
In the two large eurasians, dictators appeared in the 20th century, and regimes that were unhuman, brutal and horrible.
The Russian Bolshevici have contributed greatly to 94 million victims of communism, which the Black Book of Communism states, whether it was a daily individual repression, aimed at hunger, incompetent war or non-human experiments.
The Nazis in a non - human way destroyed about 6 million Jews and the total victims of the Second World War I estimate to 60 million.
In occupied or abandoned territories, the Germans and the Soviets were performing.
In Germany or in the SSSR, there were not only a few individuals, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes, whether actively, passively, or just assassination or pushing the head into the sand.
It's not just the specification of these nations, we're the Czechs, like, guilty.
In Germany, the Denisification, the Norimber Tribunal, was arrived in the immediate end of the war.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they started asking, Daddy, Grandpa, why did you participate in such beasts?
How could you do that!
This brought a real reflection and the healing of the company.
The German elites have so far cared mainly for the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now, they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they definitely don't want to join Alsasko-Lotrinsko or someone - to revenge - military attack - maybe everyone will recognize it.
After the cold war lost in Russia, there was no great reflex.
The window of possible positive changes was definitely closed at the millennium breakdown when the former KGB officer (sic!)Vladimir Putin reached power.
Often the criminal past is celebrated today in Russia.
The Politics of Patinovsky Russia is a remuneration, the winning of lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
Health, prosperity, and the future of our own people is no value for the summit.
Beat yourselves, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that this is only the decades of despotical regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally less valuable - pre-determined to Asian (see) tyranny.
Who is benefiting from the growth of tension around Crime?
Ukrainian army.
In the last days and hours, there has been a worsening situation at the Ukrainian-Russian border in the area of Crime.
Whom does tension growth benefit?
After a long period of relative peace, there has been a further deterioration of relations between Ukraine and Russia.
The Ukrainian party was the cause to become the Krim Polo island, which was connected to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, the reports of both opposed parties are contrary, and it is difficult to verify independently, so we have the opportunity to just think of an old, famous question to whom it benefits?
According to the reports from Moscow, there were terrorist attacks on Crim from the Ukrainian party, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and accuses Kreml of provocation.
Information on the arrest of Ukrainian special units on the territory of Russia came from the case of pilot Savčenka, a known answer that they were reportedly kidnapped in Russia.
If we joined the Ukrainian version, what would help Russia to improve the situation around Crime?
The simple answer is, in nothing.
The escalation of tension around Crime can only damage Russia, especially from the West in the form of another sanctions and strengthening the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, the Immigration Crisis' background for Europe has occurred to withdraw attention from the situation in Ukraine.
Ukrainian leadership has already lost a full loan in front of its inhabitants when the current support of President Poreshenka is moving about 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have already bankruptted the lack of generous financial injections by the EU and mainly the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to re-explicitly draw attention to its country in order to reason its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation before the voters in his country.
President Porošenko and other members of the Force's leadership wish to show themselves again as strong men who are not afraid to face the great Russia.
It's not just to hope that all those who try to raise an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their huge responsibility for lives not only for soldiers, but for all ordinary people on both hostile parties and stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria has shown inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, in Bulgaria, the monthly inflation rate of 1 % has reached in July.
This is the highest value in several years (from June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2 % was published.
The annual average inflation rate measured by the CPI index in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous period of 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumption price index in July 2016 against June 2016 was 101,0 %, so monthly inflation was 1,0 %.
The inflation rate from the beginning of the year (July 2016 against December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 against July 2015 was -0.2%.
In addition to the previous month, the increase in the roadways of these consumption groups was observed in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic drinks (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Price decreased in clothes and shoes (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and normal maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
At the same level as previous month, prices remained in alcoholic drinks and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
The U.S. Secret Services have been watching the hacker attacks of the Russians in a year.
Information on Russian attacks reached the public last month when the Federal Investigation Authority (FBI) announced that he was dealing with attacks on the servers of the Democratic Party Centre.
However, no official report is mentioned on the Russian share of the attack.
Moscow's share of the attack has denied.
The report on the tracking of the alleged Russian attack was strictly secret, because it would have shown that the US secret service has been monitoring the hacker attack and could be discovered the way they do it and what sources they use.
Two Russian rapporteurs were involved in the attack.
New Cyber Safety Advisory Board
The Russian tracking material was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, wrote Reuters.
Only a small group of eight leading Members of Congress, called the U.S. gang, was informed from public factors.
It is formed by the heads of both Chambers Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, Presidents of Democrats in both Chambers, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and four members of the Defence and Security Committees of the Congress.
The official head of the Democratic Party Donna Brazile announced on Thursday that she forms a cyber security advisory board, which is to "stop future attacks and ensure the first-class protection of the servers of the Democratic Party".
There was a dangerous parasite in the salmon of Alberto.
The liner apologized.
Based on the incentive of the consumer to health problems after consumption of the food of Losos wildly ripped - pieces 100 g, the date of consumption, 22.11.2016, the Prague hygienics carried out control in Albert's sales at the Václava Square and on the Bridge.
The check found that the L23012562/T4 series with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, on which the customer noted, was no longer available, and therefore the same series was removed with the date of consumption 11.12.2016.
The laboratory study confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It's a parasite worm of the tract of seas.
It is dangerous for a man - the larvas in the body or the muscle of fish are a strong allergen, and the human consumpted live larvas can break through the stomach wall into the internal organs, he stated Stich.
We apologize to customers for the problems of this mark product.
We immediately withdrawed the series from the sale and for preventive reasons we also downloaded all other series of this item.
There was doubt on the side of the supplier we are dealing with, and we also let this product be tested ourselves, told the newsman Albert Barbora Vanko.
If the customer bought this product, he can get it back in any of the shops and get the money back.
The larvas will destroy the freezing and enough heat adjustment
The seller was Nekton - Vrnata.
Hygienicas informed the Prague and Mediterranean Veterinary Management of dangerous products.
According to a server of safety consumption.cz people after the death of a parasite can sick with annisakiosis that manifests severe abdominal pains, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can run without symptoms, said the CTK.
The symptoms will be delivered for an hour to two weeks after consumption insufficiently processed infected fish.
After three weeks of the start of the larva disease, most of them will spontaneously leave the consumption tract.
Adult worms and larvas are sensitive to higher and low temperatures, so they are killed either with sufficient heat processing of fish meat or freeze.
Veterinaries have currently checked the salmon also with the recipient of the imported goods in the Mediterranean region.
Three of the five tested samples had a parasite in them.
The shipment of 1700 products came to the Czech Republic according to the National Veterinary Administration (SVS) at the beginning of April.
Expedited, totally in the Ahold chain, there was 919 packagings to date.
The download of unsold products from sales is currently being downloaded, said SVS speaker Peter Peichal on Friday.
Veterinaries immediately after finding positive samples, prohibited sending other products from the storage.
Seventeen-year-old British wanted to flee from Raka, apparently killed by a Russian attack.
After the initial enthusiasm and the fast marriage with the hyhadist who was slain, there was a soberness.
The expected paradise of the chaliphate has turned the British girls into a hell of a land that was not escaped.
The girl was in contact with her sister Halima, according to her relatives.
She repeatedly phoned to Britain and confided that she wanted to go home.
Leave the Islamic State is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They have orders without reason to shoot, quotes The Telegraph's family lawyer Tasnim Akunjee.
The latest tracks led to Raka, the girl responded from there the last time.
Then there was only a report of her death, but it can't be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in Eastern London.
They discussed together how she could get out of Raka and cross the Turkish border.
There they were hoping to meet their former student again.
However, Cadiza was likely killed before she could escape, because the house in which she stayed was compared to the land in May, the British ITV News said.
The TV added that the bomb must have dropped a Russian plane that attacked the IS garden in Syria.
You'd take the blue ones from the sky just to get your child out of the dangerous area, said Tasnym Akunjee, a family lawyer.
In the week when (Kadiza) thought of fleeing from the Islamic State, one Agricultural was caught in an attempt to escape and, according to the available information, was publicly killed to death.
I think (Kadiza) has interpreted it as a warning and has decided not to risk, it is according to BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Cadiza Sutlana and 15-year-old friends from school Shamimou Begum and Amir Abas were issued on the journey of February 17, last year.
They only said at home that they were going out.
However, they were headed to the Gatwick airport and from Turkey to the IS-controlled territory.
The girl's family according to a lawyer did everything she could to get Cadizu back.
You'd take the blue ones out of the sky just to get your child out of the dangerous area and this family did everything she could, connected all the powers to get her daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking being captured by a lawyer.
The only positive in his opinion is that the fate of Kadiza can serve as a scary case for other girls or even for boys who are going to be screwed up by Islamic propaganda.
"There are many cases when people went there, they realized how things are there, they understood how different it is from the promises of Islamic Propaganda, and wanted to return," said Akunjee further.
The fate of Kadiza's classmates is not known.
However, since they were also silent, their families must reconcile that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go behind the nets without committing a crime.
For centuries, the village of Inveray was the district center and the seat of the Duke of Argyl.
Since the half of the 18th century, courts and basement were held under the hall as a local prison.
The conditions in which the penalties were living were sad and many prisoners tried to escape.
Many of them are successful.
Therefore, the city representatives decided to move the prison premises to a new place.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more favourable to prisoners, heating and gas lighting.
In any event, it has not been long in operation, it has been concluded for economic reasons already at the end of August 1889, since the smaller correction device was costly for operation and has not been paid too much.
Stories of punishment and hunting ghosts.
For the public the prison opened a century later, visitors can compare the old building with a new building to make sure of the different conditions in them.
Authentic experiences are still strengthened by the guides in the time costumes.
To see, there is also a torture room where visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to the criminal, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
In the framework of the search, tourists can be locked in one of the cells, mostly because of the photograph on the memorial, or to mention the feeling behind the nets of prisoners.
Besides, the Inveray Prison is one of the most famous Scottish places where they are supposed to be scaring.
There have already been several groups of paranormal hunters, and the museum still allows people to come hunting spirits.
This night, however, will be 300 pounds, which is about 9500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the municipality also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
"Animem" effect on Snapchat is criticised as Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by an anim, but some observers say he is racially insensitive.
The Snapchat application every day allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with identical ways that bound with absurdity.
You can make yourself ananas, a dog or a figure that appears to come out of the picture of Roye Lichtenstein.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfishes every day.
Any error will be released immediately.
Snapchat filters have been criticized in the past with the accusation of promoting blackfaction or supporting white skin shades as the ideal of beauty.
So when she offered this week to users a filter that made them shining eyes, teeth and pumped faces, some criticists called it a racist charics of Asians -- "yellowface."
And they asked whether these repeated dispute questions indicated a larger problem of society -- a problem with diversion.
In the Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote, and the news and the agitation rapidly spread and Snapchat said the next day he canceled the function.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended to express the accounts to the figures of animé, not as a painting of Asians.
But the observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded the painful stereotypes of action.
Others without a package comparison with animations refused.
Grace Sparapani, a student of American art from Korea, whose tweet on photos was widely shared, stated in an email that the filter was “at least harmful and embarrassing. ”
She added that “it is difficult to argument against comparison of the apparent Asian cartoon and the effects of the filter.
It turns out that the filter is not only about yellowface (yellowface), but that the yellow face is contrary to a despicable extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural borders.
The American culture seems to have an endless fight on diversion and inclusion, from meetings of halls in Hollywood's corporations and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And an enormous amount of young people in Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - can mean that more sensitivity can be expected.
"When one filter of Snapchatu creates a picture that is insultable for a user," Katie Zhuová said on Thursday, "only very difficult today, these things are going through without notice, as it was before."
Katie Zhuová, the product manager and the designer who works for the Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her account on Snapchat and invite the others to do the same.
In the Medium and telephone interview, she was convinced that racially motivated problems reflected the lack of diversion in the workers in Snapchat.
Katie Zhuová criticised the most white, total male leadership of the company and the article finished hash with the tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either that there is no diversion between employees and colored people at the time they decide on these things," Zhu, who has Chinese-American origin, said, "or there are colored people working, but not at positions to feel safe or pleasant to speak."
Other observers share her views - the complaint that Snapchat left significantly without answers.
The company does not give the numbers relating to the diversion of its employees by having the Statute of Private Company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of his employees, but according to the speaker, he recently accepted an employee who should focus on the insufficient population and the internal management of the inclusion.
Zhua adds: “I wonder if they really need other users who can say that it is not right, ” with their account being canceled.
Army officers have drawn up the IS reporting information, said the Parliamentary Committee
The Parliamentary Committee in the report issued on Thursday, stated that officials from the United States Central Command have changed the reports of the rapporteur service to draw a more optimistic picture of war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events provided from the country.
According to the preliminary report of the working group compiled by the Republican Chairman of the Committee on Armed Forces, the reporting Committee and the Sub-Committee for the Defence Committee, it was found “extensive dissatisfaction” among the central reporting services analysts, according to which their supervisor had changed their assessment of the US efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as CentCom, is a military central in Tampa, Florida, which supervises US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press statement states: “The statements of the reporting secret services approved by the supervisor of Centcom usually offered a more positive picture of US anti-terrorism efforts than the facts on the earth, and were more consistent than the analysis obtained from other parts of the rapporteurship community. ”
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our warriors are damaged when the superior political creators are presented in the wrong analysis," Ken Calvert, Congressman and the Republican from California said.
The failure in the management of Centcom touches the top of the organization.
The 10-page report detailes the persistent problems of the Central Office in the description and analysis of the US efforts in the training of Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While no decisive evidence is offered that the High Representatives of the Administration of Obama ordered to amend the reports, the report states that the analysts had the impression that the leaders of Centcom were under pressure to present a more optimistic view of the dangers presented by the Islamic State or IS.
“In the first half of 2015, many press reports of the Central Office, statements and statements from the Congress were significantly more positive than what events actually were," the report states.
For example, the representative of Centcom publicly declared that a major military attack on the capture of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is quite clear after months of investigation," said in the statement, Member Mike Pompeo, representative of the Republican Party from Kansas.
From half of 2014 to mid-2015, the highest positions of the U.S. rapporteurs have been manipulated with the outputs of the reporting office in order to batalise the risk of IS in Iraq.
The Republicans have drawn up a working group after they have learned about the concerns of analysts about the manipulation of information from the reporting services relating to the Islamic State.
After the report published on Thursday, further investigations must follow a more detailed study.
The Centcom Intelligence Services is conducting further investigation led by the General Inspector of the Defence Department.
The Democratic Members of the Reporting Services Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to certain conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
“In between 2014 and 2015, Centcom has created a very narrow process for the compilation of information assessments on IS and Iraqi security facility”, said representative Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and Democrat representative.
According to Adam Schiff, this process “incorporated the outputs of the reporting services, ” damaged morality between analysts and“ insufficiently regarded disagreeable views. ”
However, Schiff and Democrats argue that they have not found any evidence that the White House would try to push Centcom's analysts to adjust their conclusions according to the "suggestment or political situation".
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, New York Times informed the ongoing investigation of the General Inspector Pentagon, which was launched after the complaints of Centcom's analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, speaker of Pentagon, stated that the Department of Defence would not comment on the parliamentary report, since the investigation of the General Inspector is still continuing.
He noted, however, that “the experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex data and that the rapporteurship communities and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security”.
The investigation has impacts on the framework of the question whether the Americans are successful in Iraq and Syria (the sentence which now declares a growing number of defence representatives).
However, the prosecution last year raised questionnaires about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the fact that the central headquarters are sincerely evaluating military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lybia and other crisis sites.
The criticism of the reporting on the Islamic State reflects conflicts for more than ten years when a reporting analyst Centcom Gregory Hooker wrote a research work in which it stated that the administration of President George W. Bush - despite the objections of many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted a little time to think about what would follow the invasion in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting the Islamic State's reporting services.
Last year, the authorities announced that Hooker's team concluded that, despite the public statement of the opposite, air strikes led against the raphineries of the Islamic State have not significantly weakened the financial resources of this terrorist group because the group has built temporary raphineries and oil sold on the black market.
The Times informed in September that the findings were not passed outside the central office.
Commander Centcom, gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then subjected to the criticism of the past year after many legislators found the testimony of the Senate as a too positive war evaluation.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel in Centcom.
The United States won the ground hockey in the fourth row, so today it will be a decisive game in the United Kingdom team.
Katie Bam in the fight against Japan, which ended by victory 6:1, shot three gates and only a day later for the American women's hockey team shot the first two branches of the fight in which America defeated India 3:0 on Thursday.
Five gates in two matches are a success to remember, but Bama (27) said she was not sure if something like that had ever succeeded.
"I have no idea," she said.
I don't belong to those who record their gates.
But he knows this: Americans in the Olympic Tournament lead to the games 4:0 and share the first place in a group with Great Britain, which remained unbeaten on Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2:0.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round.
Both teams have qualified to the quarterfinal and the match will decide who from the six teams ends at the first and who in the second place.
The first team will be avoided for a little longer by strong Dans who are headed by the second group.
Whatever the Saturday match is over, the Americans have caused their surprising ride here, four years after they ended between 12 teams in London's games.
Bam was in that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took a hockey on the ground hockey for her first time when she was 3 years old (her senior twin sisters played in Drexel) and entered the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player at all.
The Olympiada escaped in 2008 because she didn't get on the final list.
Then came the year 2012, when neither she nor her team were very successful.
The next year he was appointed a coach of England Craig Parnham and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have a working rate in London like we have today.
We've made a complete turn.
Thursday night Bam started in the first half by shooting the bacon in the nearby.
India entered the fight without victory in the tournament, but the team turned out to be surprisingly hard and maintained the score 1:0 until the third quarter when Bamova used the opportunity.
She fled on the left side of the playing field, then she knocked herself into the middle and shot the ball into the gate to get the Americans into the leadership of 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last gate in half the fourth quarter.
The exclusion of the American branaire, Jackie Briggs, who helped each of the three victories to a branch, was at all the first time at the tournament.
He's in a great shape.
Just like Bam.
"We are now in a good place," Parnham said, but how good it is, it will depend on the outcome of the Saturday match.
Zen trampoline in the middle of the Olympic rage
No matter where you are, no matter how much time it's - the olympics.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro, it is to feel persistence, unimaginable and unanimous competitiveness and efforts.
It's like the Olympic torch itself would be a hot colleague that is transferred from the swimmer, gymnastic and triatlonist.
You can't turn on TV, read the papers or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the front of the café without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecki or the immorality between Michael Phelps and Chad le Close.
And then it's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the coming love of women with the dolls in their faces, is on the olympics for the first time and can also be among those whose names will sound in households in the main broadcast time between advertising and spot of spots of sponsors, if he is a swimmer, gymnast or even a sponsor.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest in California is fighting for Olympic gold jumps on the trampoline.
The Olympic Fire doesn't light on all the competitions the same way.
A little in the shadows are sports that are not generally recognised: air guns shooting, arrows, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and it will probably rule long.
But if I can appoint my extraordinary favorite, let me note of the unthinkable spell of trampoline.
Although jumps on the trampolyne are the Olympic sport since 2000, when they were first placed in Sydney games, it remains after 16 years of intervention of this sport almost without notice - many people I asked, nor knew it was an Olympic sport.
It could be a regional career.
The United States has never gained medals in the trampoline jumps and until 2012, none of the athletes even reached the final.
The prices in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia and the female category between China and Canada.
This year, gold medals from London will be bound by Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
But the trampoline jumps have another failure, partly because the undedicated ear would seem more suitable to the clown university than to the olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not a expert, but just a enthusiast from the country.
It has a comic potential - comic vibration of infinite reflection - but also the freeness of gymnastics and diving, two sports that it combines in it.
The word “trampolin” is derived from the Spanish “el trampolin” which means “scockboard”.
The aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that will shoot them up to the height of nearly 10 meters and show compositions with several elements (salts, heels and combinations), before they finally land on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic Programme, they are evaluated according to the implementation, difficulties and ‘times in the air’.
In Rio, 20 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete.
The usual olympic route trajectory is forward.
The gold medal warriors must go on, faster and higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes there and back, up and down.
They try not only to reach the target tape or the starting wall, but as the television report states, it is also another inventory line: the world or the Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatic - and enough to lead the watches to tears.
But I think it's a little exhausting when you're watching the olympics.
Jumping on the trampolines in this regard brings relief.
The path of the athlete on the trampoline is upstairs.
It doesn't mean move forward.
He or she reflects as if they were in a state without weight like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again without effort up.
Without competition and of course, no difficulty can be done, but during the duration of the composition, there will be no angerous struggle for achieving the goal, no measurement of distance, but only perfect, free time and gravity.
This is just the closest when the Olympics and Zen get closer.
Female qualifications and finals take place on Friday afternoon, at 13 o'clock eastern, then a male competition on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will send the finals within the afternoon block, which starts at two days at 14:00.
In the middle of the Olympic madness, they promise a quiet, pleasant moment that you probably overlook over the other fights.
And if it is to reach attention only by being the subject of loving views and materialization - as according to Wall Street Journal recently proposed by the U.S. gymnasts - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for their new fans who are catching their breath.
“Protesting generations” in Ethiopia, long-year allies of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
The demonstrators demanding political changes in Ethiopia faced the violent opposition of the government.
The witnesses argue that many protesters were shot during the conflicts with the police.
Is war threatened in Ethiopia?
In the past decade, it was one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
But over the last few months, the country was caught by opposite disturbances that spread into more areas.
Only in the last week, thousands of people have gone to the streets that require major political changes.
According to human rights fighters, the government's response was ruthless.
The witnesses claim that the cops shot and killed the crowds of unarmed demonstrators.
In the ringing videos of protests, probably from the conclusion of the last year or the beginning of this year, members of the security forces are captured by beating young people after they were forced to stand by the wall on their hands.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights now requests a thorough examination.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together and make a step forward will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group.
The Ethiopia is the second people in Africa and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and reporting services work closely with the Ethiopians to eliminate the danger of terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and a few African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy was developed by an impressive pace.
Her infrastructure has improved essentially - in Addis Abeba's capital, even a new suburban train rides.
And the streets of the city are typically calm, safe and clean.
However, the Ethiopia could hardly be described as a model of democracy - the organization fighting for human rights without stopping talking about government repression - the opposition in the country was elaborately silent, the disidents were effectively silent.
Many were imprisoned, imprisoned, killed or expelled far to the desert.
However, this can change.
"When you choke people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a breakup," said Seyoum Teshome, who speaks at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He's protesting all youths.
He's protesting the whole generation.
The complaint is many and concerns everything from land disputes to absolute control of the power of the coalition.
After the elections last year, which have been widely criticised, the ruling party and its allies received the last chair held by the opposition and now controls 100 per cent in Parliament.
At the same time, pressure on the border with Eritrea is increasing. The conflict along this untouched, controversial border demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Anyliticals are afraid that separatist groups, which have been mostly oppressed over the past years, such as the Orome Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use confusion and rearmate themselves.
There are several factors that explain why now, after the years of pushing under the surface, these bitter feelings have erupted again.
The first is seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopans can communicate through social networks up to a few recent years when they became commonly available cheaper smart phones and improved Internet services.
And even though the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as usually happens during protests, many people can still communicate through the Internet proxy that hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians discussed how they gathered for protests.
There is further greater solidarity between Oroma and Amhara, two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromes and Amhars are not natural allies.
After the long ages of Amhara, mostly from the Christian tops of Ethiopia, they came in politics and trade and used the Oromes, many of whom are Muslims and live in the bottom.
But it's changing, too.
"We are on our way to united leadership," said Mulat Gemech, leader of Orom.
The greatest protests occurred in the areas of Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is illegally dominated by members of the ethnic Tigrays, which are about 6 percent of the population and control the army, reporting services, trade and policy.
The third cause of anxiety is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, former rebel leader, was the Ethiopian chairman of the government for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he was subjected to unshot disease.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see as a corner.
The analysts say he was especially able to detect the original signals of dissatisfaction and use the ambassadors to process and get opponents on his side.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," said Abdi, analyst of conflict.
The new President of the Government of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was withdrawn from relative unknownness to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analytics claim that he has no confidence in the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be another bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such anxiety in 2005 after thousands of people protested against what the analysts called the elections that the government had tricked and then stole.
There was a hard intervention during which many protestors were killed -- even if less than in the past months -- and this period of anxieties went relatively quickly.
Experts for development appreciated the leaders of Ethiopia for the visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new town train and the measurement of progress in combating poverty.
Of course, it is clear that the progressive growth of disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop it.
And there's a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, the protesters in the city of Gondar in Amhara attacked business companies owned by Tigers and regret against the Tigers on social networks increasingly.
Analysts say protests are putting into the unpleasant situation of the United States and other Western allies.
The American government uses Ethiopia as a base for drones over Neighbour Somalia, even though recently declared that the base was closed.
While the West wants to clearly support democracy, he doesn't want his alliance to fall apart in such a non-constant area.
"This," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of sharpness."
Donald Trump explains his statement of Obam and IS finance as "sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried to batalise the latest controversy that floods his campaign on Friday, saying that he didn't mean it seriously when several times this week insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were “baseders” of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions about the capacity of the Republican candidate to speak clearly to the president with the American public.
It also puts his advocate in an unpleasant situation, who strongly defended him in a violent time and must explain that he may not mean his notes.
After this proposal for a meeting on Wednesday night Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and insisted in the interviews that he really did not intend to say that the President and H. Clinton had created the IS.
Of course, in a Twitter contribution on Friday morning, Trump declared he was only sarcastic.
The contribution was contrary to the claim of the old only one day when Trump said in several interviews that his accusations were serious.
When a conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump's note that Obama was trying to destroy IS, the candidate of the Republicans did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes at the moment Trump tried to focus his campaign on the economy, while his preferences in pre-electoral surveys are declined.
Trump and Clinton participated in the duel of Michigan on economic issues this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to this subject.
On Twitter, he again warned that Clinton's proposals were linked to the increase of taxes, and he said that her speech was boring.
Trump used sarcasm defense before.
At the end of July, when he criticized the wave of criticism, when he made a proposal that the Russians should break into Clinton's e-mails, they later explain their note with the words: “Of course I am sarcastic.”
This approach allows Trump to push the borders of political declarations and mild them as necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing, how much some reports have been responded to his favourites to find out how they react, and according to the reaction, he then "supplied an explanation," said Ruth Sherman, a communicator who watched the language that both candidates used.
But I also think that in his statements he is reversed and knows that they are sufficiently grave to explain them in different ways.
Because the results of the pre-election surveys in his favour continue to decline, Trump has chosen a more injurious tone in recent days rather than mildly for general voters.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed that Tump was with a large distance from Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close behind it in Florida.
Trump is at all trying to avoid apologizing for the provocative words he says, but he often accuses his criticism of the wrong interpretation of his words or the lack of understanding of his sense of humor.
But along with the fact that Trump faces increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes put into the unpleasant situation of his devoted advocates, who must stand behind him publicly, whether his notes are provocative.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Prime Minister of New York, who is one of the most prominent Trump advocates, had to defend a candidate on Thursday in a CNN interview.
"I believe what he says is a legitimate political comment," said Giuliani when Trump's claim was asked to establish the Islamic State.
That's true in the sense that IS was almost unknown before Obama, a small organization, which he was calling a new man completely wrong, and it happened because he pulled his army out of Iraq.
Most of the ordinary Republicans are trying to argument that the Obama government, in which Clinton acted as foreign minister, would allow the IS to grow and fail to manage the situation in the Middle East as aggressively.
Before Friday's meetings in Pennsylvania Trump, he continued to put fire around on Twitter for the communications means because they were mixing every word of his word and are concerned with it.
He laughed at “poor, pathetic ” television students who try to understand him, and said:“ He can't. ”
Several democrats apologize to Trump screwed up that it was just another proof that the president's office was not eligible.
Coffee was pushed out of the price market. Now he's returning to Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe cafe was a screwed place in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, without Wi-Fi, but where the coffee was given for 15 years.
Naturally, it was pushed out of the house at Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - the store Verb replaced in the summer 2014 - sells salads in the form of cakes.
The locals mourned as the last loss of a growing city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel is plugged in and from Verb is now a soap trade. ”
But if there's a change in New York, then it's also reopening.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than mile north of the original place.
New Verb has wifi and accepts payment cards, but some of the original employees are working there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new Verba manager is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term original café employee, who is also owner and executive director of the new place.
In Verb he started in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of the customers offered him to pay the move to a new place, he said he would do it with joy.
Rodriguez, 36, left many things as they were.
Verb still has the same cookie supplier and bought the same machine model for espresso.
He even reused the light from the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new.
He started using new appliances.
There are sandwiches in the offer, eggs, cheese and toppings, such as bats and roasted bowls.
You'll also find a bowl of brown rice.
The coffee doesn't give you any more beer, but it offers you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed the constant influx of original prints.
"A number of original customers also had to move out from Williamsburg for prices," he said.
Last week there was one of those customers, Rebecca Oliveir.
Ms. Oliveir, 34, lived in Williamsburg and went to Verb Cafe often.
Even after the café moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she completely stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found that what I like is coffee and culture in Verba," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, but on that day, instead of her usual ice coffee, she gave her a mixed chai, another news.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-year customer, has been devoted to Verba since 2003.
He walks before work and always orders the same thing.
"Over quarter and eight every day, as a watch, I come here and they're preparing for me my goose with all and with butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add to the offer of a new appliance.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what is usually, but sometimes he gives bacon, eggs and ham.
Rodriguez said he didn't feel sorry that he took his old place.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered him to make a special soap for Verb and to use filtered coffee from the coffee.
"I think we could still use it," said Rodriguez.
Also, the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint took the coffee well.
One of the new customers translated the offer to Polish and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to expose it soon to make his new neighbors feel like home here.
The new place has other advantages.
Local producer of fruit juice wants to pull into the bottle and sell filtered coffee.
The cafeteria is offered to spread into the neighbouring building.
Many customers are enough to get their old favorites back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says when the coffee opens up again, it's like getting coffee back home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressive food from crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after joining the president's office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was sitting in the Oval Chamber and lunch.
President Roosevelt enjoyed the chosen foods from the 5th Avenue, such as a gus limb and a Marilandian turtle soup.
But his menu on this day was more modest: eggs in the devil's way in a paradise sauce, potatoes and as dessert swed pudink.
"It was an act of cooking solidarity with people who suffered," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also the message to the Americans how to eat. ”
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights is devoted to gastronomic history.
The last book of Andrew Coe "Chop Suey" was about Chinese kitchen in America, while Jane in her book "97 Orchard" tells the life story of the living house at the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work "A Square Meal", published by Harper on Tuesday, is history of American kitchen during a large economic crisis.
They showed themselves cooking solidarity and met with the reporter at Eisenberg's sandwiche store, a small strict buffet in the neighborhood of Flatiron, which has been running since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and sandwich with sacred olives, and Andrew, 57, gave a peanut, a potato cake and a mixed vegetable.
The reporter ordered a mass carbonate, which, according to a pair, was great to talk about food during the crisis.
"The cartons were very popular," Ms. Ziegelman said.
There was a peanut, liver, and a bovine carbon.
They were made of the precision and other cheap food that set the ingredient.
Stop the quantity of peanuts you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe's screwed up.
"They would lie in your stomach like a lead," he said.
In years before the crisis, American kitchen, especially in rural areas, was given by a buffet of eating what you eat.
Women's teams cooked for farm workers and for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
They were the Americans who sent food to the hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" watches how the nation dealt with it that it was not suddenly a country of abundance.
"It was the time when the food became a central, fearful point for the American people," Coe said to explain why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Similarly, the new budget diet was feared: The mysterious foods, such as carbanates and casterel foods, were expanded as “a wonderful way to use the remains, ” noted Ziegelman, because the cooks could hide nonestetic sugars under a layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - for years the central point of American food - has become a sparely allocated luxury.
The strange mixtures that were intended to serve as caloric and nutrients had the advantage of taste or even a healthy mind in cooking.
During the studies for the book containing the recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a timely food from a baked nail filled with bovine butter.
"It was not the favorite increase for the evening table," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman emphasized: “It was surrealistic. ”
The barley's butter with a baked nawel is not going together.
It was typical for many home recipes.
As never before and never after, domestic economies - among them Louise Stanley, a broad federal office for domestic economy in 1923 to 1943 - were driving food habits of the country.
They gave the recipes and articles in the newspapers and magazines, called for women to take over the burdens of the budget, and the squirrels, such as cream spaghets with carrots, converted into tasteful foods.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical enthusiasms.
First of all, the tastes were raised in the response of the government to her hungry citizens, such as the post of President Herbert Hoover, "I'll take a pie."
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farming kitchen of his childhood, he stood as a chosen millionaire to become.
"The Council ate continental kitchens, such as fish with a corn sauce," said Andrew Coe.
He ate in a nearly golden room, wearing a smoking.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably make the same mistakes if his wife Eleanor did not force him to follow his own stomach example.
As the book tells, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not even interested in the taste, which led to the fact that the White House “was not only the most disgusting food in Washington, but also the most uncomfortable ways prepared. ”
A number of meal habits from the time of the crisis went away as soon as the country regained its legs.
The link remains in our constant calories and nutrition values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
A couple say that during writing the book they better understood the diet habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - for example why she couldn't throw out food.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman recalled: “They were bad people. ”
There was an accident with the branches.
When there were clean tables at Eisenberg, she and Mr. Coe pulled a dessert that they prepared at home: a swimming dessert that President Roosevelt had eaten for lunch.
"It's called Swedish Cream," said Ziegelman and added that the common trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There wasn't any cream there, just squirrels, little flour, sugar, water, and squirrels.
Everybody unwillingly put a spoon into a dense brown material.
Surprisingly, it was wrong.
Andrew Coe added it, and then again.
And as the right household, he said to his wife: “It would be good for a little bit of screwed hair. ”

Gilead has the right to compensate for legal representation in the case of a patent against type C yellow versus Merck concertency
The Court of Justice decided that the company Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to pay the fees for lawyers which were incurred in the process on the patent against yellowness of type C against the manufacturer of Merck & Co Inc.
In June, a judgment was repealed, according to which Gilead was to pay 200 million for damages for the violation of two patents of Merck in connection with the very successful medicines of the company Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the Federal Court of Justice discovered repeatedly illegal negotiations by Merck, including other lies under the oath and other non-ethical practices.
The Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman stated on Thursday that Gilead has the right to excuse charges that were made in connection with representation in the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the new generation drug market against yellow C, which can heal more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case comes from 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to be owner of the basic laboratory research for sophosbuvir, the active component of the medicines from Gilead.
Americans supported military units claim that they have received full control of Manbridge
The United States military units have received full control of the northern city Manbridge near the borders with Turkey after the last Islamic state warriors fled the city, said a speaker group on Friday.
Syrian democratic forces (SDF) are now prosecuting the city after leaving the rest of the group of radicals hiding in the city.
The units released over 2,000 civilians detained by the radicals, said to the agency Reuters Sharfan Darwish from the SDF Alliance and the Manbridge military Council.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching for it," said the agency Reuters.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2%
Hillary Clinton published her tax confession on Friday for 2015, which states that the presidential candidate for democrats and her husband had incomes of $10.75 million in that year and took a real tax of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton was dedicated to $1 million for charity, mainly to the Clinton Foundation (Clinton Foundation).The Expert Bill Clinton contributed to a shared fee by a $5.3 million for lectures, and the former Minister of Foreign Affairs awarded the income of $3 million from Simon & Schuster's book on his activities in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Clinton co-candidate, the American Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, together with his wife, Anne Holton, published a tax confession in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are still a model of financial transparency," Jennifer Palmieri said in the statement that helped Clinton with the campaign.
On this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and departs from his previous promises that his tax confession will be published.
It is a custom that candidates for the President of the United States will publish their tax confession, even though the law does not imply them.
Trump, a New York trader, and his lawyers quoted the audit of the tax board of the United States Ministry of Finance as a reason for his refusal of tax confession.
"Your move," said Hillary Clinton's campaign branches on Twitter and aimed at a tax recognition of a democratic candidate.
Michael Cohen, a special Trump advisor, said on Thursday CNN that Trump wouldn't let the tax confession be published until the audits were completed.
According to Trump's criticism, including the Republican candidate for the President of 2012 Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, it agrees that his refusal raises questions about its net profit, charity contributions, trade transactions and other relations, including relations with Russia.
Clinton, in the question, is strongly presented and published a video on Friday, reminding the high position of the Republic of Trump insisting that his tax confession be published.
On Thursday, mention the issue in its speech to economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all other candidates have done to the presidential office after decades - to public their tax confession," she said to people.
The Political Organization stated that Trump paid no tax or very low tax in the last two years of the 1990s, and New York Times publicist quoted a number of tax advisors and accountants who claim that it could be so now.
The rates of federal taxes have become a theme in the election of the president.
Clinton is promoting a rule named by a billionaire Warren Bufett, which would ensure that all those who make more than a million dollars in a year will pay a tax at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffet at the Clinton meeting in Omaza, the state of Nebraska, where Buffet's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, invited Trump to meet and exchange tax confessions.
Buffett said that he also passed the IRS audit and that Trump is "not afraid" of the financial office, but of voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax confession back until 2007.
Clinton, now living in Chappaqua in New York, paid a federal tax average of 32 per cent and a combined tax of approximately 40.5 per cent between 2007 and 2014.
Clinton's tax confession in 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, it is only $100 in their income.
Their main investment was a low-income mutual index fund, from which the Clintons reported revenues in dividends and interests of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chilli or fireworks for elephant protection in Tanzania
Nature protectors in Tanzania use a non-ortodox way to prevent elephants from walking into human accommodations - throwing condoms filled with chille powder.
This procedure has also demonstrated the Honeyguide foundation, which came with the idea a few years ago, along with the American Environmental Organization The Nature Conservance, this procedure promotes and trains volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, how by using this non-violent procedure in four steps to protect their homes and fertility without hurting animals.
Many of them used spears to defend themselves before.
Friday is the world day of elephants, which is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“We have recorded the change in behaviour in these communities since they have developed this... tools. People believe much more that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without hurting them," said the Executive Director of the Honeyguide Damian Bell Fund in the statement.
The first and second step is to light on the passing elephant with the battery and start the claxon.
If it doesn't help him, it will be expelled by the so - called “chilli cloud. ”
Chilli powder mixed with salt with petarda packed into the condom, its ending is so that only the node is looking out of it.
The condom will explode after the explosion, and a gentle powder of chill will be spread into the air.
In most cases, one elephant is enough, and the elephant goes in another direction.
The last option is to fire that causes a loud, clear explosion.
The Jewish director rebelled to the Berlin Hotel for removing the code for calling to Israel to the "quest" of Arabs - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin caused a disturbance in the media after discovering that the hotel Campinski Bristol in Berlin has no code for calls to Israel, according to the employee's words on the basis of the "requirement" of Arab clients.
Claude Lansmann, author of the documentary picture of the Holocaust “Shoah”, ventilated his frustration from the hotel Campinski Bristol in Berlin in an open letter to the German FAZ journal.
During his recent stay, Lansmann tried to find Israel on the list of call codes at the hotel.
However, the State was not placed among the countries where it could be called directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, Germany, Israel was removed and deleted?
He wrote Lansmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers a call to Israel through its own call center.
The director was looking for explanations, and with a problem, he turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received, Lansmanna, according to his words, “shocked. ”
The hotel employee replied that the measures were “decisive after considering the leadership of the Campinski Hotels”.
The reason for the director's step was even more intense.
"The majority of our guests are the Arabs and they demanded that Israel's call code be erased," Lansmann quoted in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, the Ambassador of Israel in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman referred to the case as “great shame”.
We were terrified and shocked.
It's a huge shame about yourself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany, and in addition, in such a hotel chain, is even more shameful.
No further explanation is necessary.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," he said.
The event caused a strong reaction online, people called it scandal.
Some believe that the hotel Kempinsky simply lost himself in the demands of Arab customers.
“Shane to you”, the other article indicates that the hotel located in the Kurfurstendam Noble Street stands near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel's journal, the hotel itself quickly held any charges by calling the event "excuse" and "Apologizing" to Lansman.
“Never was issued a direct order” to include Israel in the list of call codes, quoted by Suddeutsche Zeitung representative of the hotel Campinski.
It adds that the call code was added to the list.
The police used tear gas and rubber missiles against the protesting Brazilian students
The confrontation of students and police occurred in Brazil in San Paul on Thursday, when the students met at a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
The protesting police used tear gas and rubber missiles.
The problem was that the government's regular services tried to expand, which ended by using rubber missiles and tear gas.
A number of hundreds of students attended the demonstration to express their concerns about their plans.
Among the suggestions of the governor of the state San Paulo Gerald Alckmina to save money, it is also to close nearly hundreds of public schools and to move 300 000 students.
Some of the participants of the demonstration were able to see the signs on the wall against the temporary President Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes only a few days after the demonstrators went to the streets to support the President Dilma Rousseff, when the Senate decided about her accusation.
Business between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian Ambassador in Iran, Levan Jagaryan increased after the cancellation of sanctions between Moscow and Teheran in the inter-annual comparison of 70.9 per cent.
As the Ambassador said, since the international sanctions against Iran have been cancelled, the interests of Russian companies traded in the country have increased.
Russian companies renew existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Another expanding trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Jagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016 the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached $856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 per cent and reached $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
The jump growth of trade provided supply of machine equipment, ground vehicles and weapons," the Ambassador said.
Jagaryan also expects Russia to visit the record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran delivered about 35,000 visas to the citizens of Iran, mostly travelling visas.
In addition, Iran first arrived between top 20 countries according to the number of tourists who arrived in Russia.
Safely, the record number of tourists from Iran in Russia last year will be overcome," he said.
At the same time, Iran visits a relatively small number of Russians. The Ambassador hopes there will be a change.
"I can personally recommend visiting the city of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the memories of ancient Persian civilization are well preserved," he said.
Scott Callum Skinner hurrys home after the British got gold in cyclist
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the hall of glory last night in a man's team sprint at the velodrome in Rio, when the trio team of VB defended the title from London 2012.
Thirty-five-year-old family from Glasgow was in the role of the brake he took for his Scott Sir Chris Hoy, and a young man enjoyed the legend when he joined the target and stole a victory from the hands of the favorite New Zealand.
Britain won surprisingly four years ago and Hoy won the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And the same trick they repeated after the end of the modest sixth in the world championship in the road cyclist in March, even though Hoy ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Peking and London was a replacement for a specialized introductor Jamie Staff.
Hence, Hindes showed up just in time.
Once Hoye left, a place that he tried to fill Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton was released.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was with Hoy a champion four years ago - and Skinner and Skinner reached the Olympic record in qualification, but the tricott took over the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was a little behind his bike, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner kept the leadership.
The change in the strategy was a great part of transformation when Hindes went to a higher transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and partially Skinner to keep their pace.
Hoy tracked the race from his position of the BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes came out on the stage, he didn't get his eyes off them.
The 30 - year - old Skinner, a family of Glasgow, said: “It is a pleasant comparison. ”
I'm here to get the best of me and honor my name.
We created a Olympic record in the final, and we defeated the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After the triumph next to Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the road after a weak start.
The note later was withdrawn, and the British rivals had no chance to appeal.
This time, this victory didn't happen to any such a problem.
Hindes said: “With all those British flags in the tribunals, I felt like in London. ”
In the last three months, we've all been together as a team.
We lost in many world races, so wining the Olympiade again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for the nation who won seven out of ten contests in Peking and London.
If it is to show progress in the past five months, then we are waiting for five days to be able to be able to do this.
With the form Kenny showed, it is not unthinkable that he would repeat Hoy's success and won three gold medals on one olympians at the same time.
It would then be for Kenny - who is exactly on the day of 12 years younger than Hoy, also on 23 March (this date seems to be sacred for British sports, this day also celebrates Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - meant a total of six gold and one silver medal.
Anyway, how much Hoy got.
As another one, Kenny will participate in the sprint that starts today and takes another three days.
An eighteen - year - old cousin from Bolton said: “I am enjoying this.
The team race is always the best.
You win with the others.
To tell the truth, wining for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said: “When another two gold medals win, he should have a knight’s title. ”
It was the only medal race that day, but Britain was waiting for more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest to the prosecutor communities for four miles.
It's over with time 3:51.943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and finals (22:42) are held on today's second day of the race to which Wiggins will be concentrated.
Yesterday before the qualification race, he debated with the Commissioners when the judge called him to measure the height.
In a similar race of women that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavia reached the world record with time 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on its strong team of road cyclists and controlled the middle period of the Olympic games and gained a lot of medals.
After really unique performances showing total advantage in Beijing and London, the Rio expectations were reduced during the preparation.
There were dramatic events on the background, not the most recent resignation of the Technical Director Shane Sutton in April for the accusations of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the career of giants such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
Nevertheless, as the first night of race on velodroma reports, the legendary reputation that the team of Great Britain can give a high performance with perfect time could be reaffirmed.
The uncertain future of the tabernacle in Portland after the completion of the energy supply contract
The future of the portland aluminium tabernacle in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of employees - is uncertain because of the power plant that the company supplys electricity and which informed the purpose of one of the owner of the carriage contract to terminate electricity supply. All electricity supply contracts are expected to be shortened.
This step takes place after the Government of the State of Victoria decided this year not to extend the grants they maintain.
The validity of the twenty-year grant will expire in November.
Alcoa Portland may be in danger of up to 2000 jobs.
When closing, up to 2000 jobs can be threatened - direct or indirect.
And since the carpet consumes about 10 percent of the total generated electricity in Victoria, there can be other lavine effects.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry tabernacle in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa company in Portland is prolonged and threatened to close it.
This step follows several years of speculation on the future of the company, originally in response to a strong Australian dollar and recently due to prices for race production.
AGL, which delivers electricity from Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, announced that it is expected that some of the other three owners will also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the race is the joint company of Alcoa and Alumina, the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects the Portland race to continue to work, so in other words, that the demand for electricity from the carpet will continue," she said.
AGL stated that the contracts are so-called “insurance contracts” that were to enter into force since November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month period of declaring, so their validity really ends in 2017.
“AGL continues to assume that the contracts will participate in profits for the fiscal year 2017”, stated the electricity.
Any possible impact on AGL profits since the fiscal year 2018 is further limited by the strong view of the commodity market for high electricity prices.
AGL stated that she had already written the value of contracts according to her accounting books of $187 million “in case it would be terminated”.
The Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract "is not affected by its ... ability to operate the tabernacle or to secure electricity supply in the carpet."
The US company stated that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang to start paying since November this year, even though it still has to explain why it resigned from the contract.
Analytics are very cautious with regard to the possible conclusion of the Portland tabernacle in Victoria and the Tomago race near Newcastle as a result of a weak economy in the sector.
The leader of AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts at the beginning of this week, said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago around 900 megawatts a year.
If both of these companies were withdrawn from the market, it would mean a significant reduction in market demand [electric energy].
It would not be good for us as a producer," he said.
Kendall is not only a reality TV show of Kardashian - now it's the envelope of the luminous Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), the model and the fourth daughter of the Mother-Manager clan Chris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the title page of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the Ambassador of Estee Lauder, who played a fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on its account on Instagram on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, when I look at this title page, I want to cry," Kendall wrote.
The discovery of the title page followed a bizarre (or simply continuation of the humor in Kardashian's administration?) an invented video, in which the whole family of Kardashian-Jenners (Bar's rippers Rob and Caitly and all of them are the favorite Uncle of the show business, the producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). They forgot on the envelope of their sisters, just so that the scene could end with a classical turn: they're preparing a secret party.
It is a wide range of history lines almost every "born" part of the child's TV show (Seacrest says: "Did you think we've forgotten about you?" with the honestness of a drawn rabbit in the show at 8 a.m.), but Chris had somehow needed to ensure that the other girls in this public could be eager.
Because when we look at the audience number of Vogue magazine, we must have entered the new age of Kardashian.
The older sister Kim may have pushed Kendall on the Vogue envelope (with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of a brilliant edition of the magazine is another league.
The light edition of Vogue magazine is the most selling number of the year.
Manufacturing, which is more like a book for advertising purposes than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of books (Fashionist calculated that the 832 pages in last year were 615 pages with advertising content).
The discovery of the star appearing on the title page is unexpected, so it is not surprising that in the past two years the photographs of the magazine have escaped before its official publication.
Among the women that have appeared on the envelope in the past, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelist, or Kate Moss.
In recent years, more “celebrites that make models ” appeared on the title page than“ models that are celebrites. ”
Jennifer Lawrence, Oskar's owner and the Ambassador of the Dior mark, appeared on the title in 2013, a year later she had the honor of Lagy Gaga.
But even though it's very unlikely that Kendall -- which the magazine describes as a "prolomised model" of her generation -- falls into the first category, it will be in a very good society.
These celebrites are not relatives of famous people, nor reality show stars, or children of today who know how to make well cut videos (although Jenner represents all this).
They are provingly talented women who are in entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the title page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career by publishing the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is excited about Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymore, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June and called them "the bitches of the moment".
These feelings have reappeared with the report that Jenner will appear on the Vogue envelope.
But this dissatisfaction is not in place.
Kendall Jenner is on the envelope of the light vogue.
It's a supermodel in the right sense.
He's showing for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you makeup from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own paywalles.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter that she took for the Love magazine.
And at free times, it's acting in reality show, maybe just as one of the ways to see Courtney and her children.
Communist Law Assistance Centres will deny 160,000 people annually
More than 160 000 most threatened citizens have been rejected each year in community legal assistance centres, and in the sector themselves, they are about to influence further limitations of funding to the already excessive services.
In Queensland, three of the five people -- mostly people in advanced ages, immigrants, threats of workers, victims of violence and people without financial means to combat unfair immigration and similar -- are rejected already when they seek free legal assistance and representation.
Communities' legal services, which are already so tense to crack, are going to go for further scratches.
Since June of the next year, these legal aid centres will lose another 30 per cent of federal finances.
The director of the Communities Centre for Law Assistance in Queenslad James Farrell said that according to the latest general report of the National Association of Communities of Law Assistance was found that five thousand people were rejected annually.
Mr. Farrell said that without annulment of the federal government's decision, the situation will be worsened.
"The Community centres are chronicly underfinancing in Queensland, which means that thousands of people are rejected vital services they need," he said.
People who have escaped the relationship with the violent, people with excessive and disturbing debts, families passing off, workers who are unfairly released - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they have no chance to get the help they need.
Since June 2017, the Federal Government will reduce the funding by 30 per cent, which will lead to the need for further thousands of threatened people from Queensland to be identified in complex legal problems without help.
We call upon the State Representative and Senator Queensland George Brandise to prevent this shortening of finances immediately to receive the help they need when they get into legal problems.
In the past year, the government has received its obligation to ensure the financing of legal assistance until the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the community centres of legal assistance and the community of their clients and the Government of Palaštuk must invest in this important work.
A complaint on the Donald Trump campaign after a member of the headquarters reportedly targeted the weapon.
New York: The campaign of Donald Trump was charged with alleged inactivity after they were informed that the Director of Operations in Northern Karolina was targeted by a member of the office during the ride of the Jeep.
The incident was described in the court record, which was transferred to Vincent Bordini, former software trainer in the state campaign in the Charlotta Wednesday.
He told Bordini that he waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before he concluded that “this would not happen. ”
The director Earl Phillip “signed the fingers of the gun, put the right indicator on the trigger and directed Vincent's head on the bowl, ” said Bordina in the lawsuit.
The record states that Bordini, after complaint on local and regional campaign leadership, found that at least four other people experienced the same thing with Phillip.
“The weapons must not be fired to cause damage”, said Bordina in the lawsuit.
The complaint comes only two days after the Republican candidate called for an appointment for the President, when he said to the electors in North Carolina that the owners and the holders of the weapons (which is adjusted in the United States in the second addition of the Constitution), if his contestant Hillary Clinton was elected and able to appoint his judge.
Trump's campaign says that the media of his words had ripped out of context and that Trump did not defend violence.
Bordini in the lawsuit requests reimbursement from the campaign for careless surveillance and Philip for the threat of personal security, illegal use of violence and the cause of emotional injury.
Trump's speaker Hope Hicks did not respond immediately to the comment request.
The attempts to get statements from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, the local reporting branch in Charlotte, announced that Phillip left the campaign recently.
No one responded to his innovative Consulting Services for a short time.
The Republican candidate for President Donald Trump is running a controversial pre-election campaign.

Britain must continue to spread the Olympic Spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be the source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is hugely attractive, just like London 2012, when we have developed extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions will be able to grab from the Olympic games.
Olympic games meant huge benefits for Startford and East End.
And we'll do it again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
Only for our local communities we create 10,000 new training sites, 40,000 new jobs and end up with the unemployment of young people around the airport.
Just as before the London Olympiad in 2012, there will be people who will think that the extension of Heathrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic games and that we would laugh at the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and even in the case of Heathrow, it turns out they were wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer every question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is a infrastructure project, which is participating in many people and companies, not just a few.
Extension is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth by 211 billion pounds, to leave heritage in the form of skills and employment both in the area of the airport and throughout Britain.
We have an excellent team on Heathrow, which has initiated an investment programme in infrastructure for 11 billion pounds, starting with the T5 terminal, which has been selected by the best terminal in the world for five years after T2 terminal, which was built between the two most moving ranvees in the world.
They are now ready to add a third ranvey worth 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The games in London in 2012 were the huge success of Great Britain and I am convinced that the extension of Heathrow will also be.
It is time to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympic games and expand Heathrow, ensure trade in the future and leave the heritage of skills and employment that British can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of the branch board and former Deputy Director for the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in cat game and mouse blocking ads
The attempts to overcome the programs blocking the advertisement have become a cat and mouse game for companies that make online marketing. At least one of the companies that program such software claims.
On Thursday, then, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop sites, Adblock Plus published a contribution on its website, which states that users can update the filters in their program and block the advertisement on this social network.
Facebook stated Tuesday that his desktop website will change the encoding around advertising, so it will be more difficult for advertising filters to find which parts of the website are advertising.
But Adblock now claims that new codes have already been over.
The speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote in a blog article that “this kind of war between the open source of advertising community and those who try to surround them has been invented since the ad blocking was invented” and that Facebook is likely to come with another own correction.
The fact that the company owning the largest social network in the world has been involved in war only proves the great problem of blocking advertising for industry.
According to the study, Pagefair and Adobe used advertising filters around 200 million people in the world last year - almost four times before it was in 2013.
Mobile ads now reaches 84% of the Facebook advertising profits, every day Facebook from mobile devices visits 1.03 billion active users.
The speaker stated that the company is going against advertising filters on the desktop because mobile advertising filters for mobile social network applications and Instagram are not working.
The advertising on the desktop still represents profits so high that Facebook decides to invest in it.
Facebook also stated Tuesday that it would update a tool for “ad preferences” (ad preferences) to give people the possibility of better controlling the way advertising is displayed.
On Thursday, Facebook announced that the new Adblock filters are disturbing them because they could also block the content that does not relate to advertising.
"This is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem," the Facebook speaker said in an email statement.
The blocking of the advertisement is an insensitive tool, and we were more likely to focus on building tools such as Ad Preferences that control people.
A woman was hit by a Swiss highway car
The victim was lying on the road in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses of an event on Thursday morning, a couple of cars were overtaked on the highway, a woman who probably tried to commit suicide.
There was an accident on the A1 highway near Morges in Vaud canton shortly after midnight in Thursday.
The Vaud police stated in the statement that the actress of the Desperate Act lied in the darkness of the road and took over several cars.
Clearly, the victim, a woman aged 49, wanted to kill herself and hit a few cars, including a truck.
She died in the spot.
Several drivers have already been interrogated, but according to the police, they still have not all been identified, and the police are calling these drivers and all the others who were witnessing the accident to sign up.
A criminal investigation was opened, a “logical” step in a situation like this, said for Le Tribune de Geneve legal representative Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to see if one of the drivers involved will face a charge.
Was it possible to prevent the attack?
This is what the prosecutor must find out," said Hofstetter.
On the basis of two similar cases of the past five years, the drivers seem not to be responsible.
In both cases - of which one was the person walking along the road - it was decided that motorists cannot expect a walker who crossed the road in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, the police officer was dismissed of the charges for death of negligence after she crashed in August 2014 and killed a man lying on the road A1 near Paynerne.
At the court, the victim, at 22 years of age, was drinking alcohol and fell down on the road.
The Court found that the police officer - who responded to emergency calls - had traveled in a reasonable way and that the presence of a man on the road was “a very unique and unforeseen situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information on the quarter incident that happened in Morgues should log in on the police on phone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerant city.
Prague is the favorite destination of the LGBT community.
The Association of the Czech travel offices and the Agency (ACHCKA) expects to reach up to 20,000 visitors within Prague Pride.
On Friday, the Executive Director of ACHCKA, Katerina Petricová, informed it.
The Sixth Year of Prague Pride began on August 8, the festival approaches the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transexuals (LGBT).
Thirty-five thousand people attended the event last year.
"The Prague belongs to the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, for a high level of tolerance and a wide scale of specialized enterprises," said Petřičkova.
According to an examination of directors, foreign visitors spend the festival average of 3100 crowns per person.
Gay tourists are available to support their journey special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
"The travel move generally means that the LGBT clientel is very lucrative, he is interested in staying in higher prices with a high standard of travel services and wasting more than the others," said Petřičkova.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium will also take place in the festival programme this year.
It is presented by experts from the LGBT sector of travel from Europe, the United States and China.
The Festival continues until Sunday, August 14th.
The main theme this year is love, but the action will also be devoted to several thematic areas of family, AIDS prevention and transgender problems.
The top of the festival will be a traditional passage on Saturday with alegorical cars that will go from the Václava Square to Summer.
The story that thousands of people have participated in the past years this year will celebrate a minute of silence of the victims of the June attack in the night club in Orlando, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Matt are celebrating forty years.
The unrestrainable Pat and Matt boxes, whose effort usually ends with disaster, have enjoyed small and large watchers forty years.
The pilot part of this evening series of director Lubomir Benesh had the premiere on August 12, 1976.
In the form of this animated series, now known by the audiences in more than a hundred countries of the world, the jokes of the artist and director Lubomir Benesh were drawn for the magazine with two boxes of Master Oucholic and Sedlec.
Beneš then called for collaboration by the dramaturg of Jiří Cubic and the artist Vladimir Jirank and together created a film of Kutjaci.
Today's shape with yellow and red trick and bullets and radios received the buildings in 1979, when Prague began to produce a series for Slovak TV in the Short Film.
The names of Pat and Mat then received the boxes in 1985, this time it was already filmed directly for the Short Film of Prague.
In 1990, Lubomir Beneš established his own studio of an animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Curych, where other parts were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creators, many of them were involved in Benes’ son Marek.
Currently there are over 90 episodes with stories of these boxes, which are all spinning under their hands, but never angry and always filled with optimism, ideas and enthusiasm, and eventually they are satisfied with their work, which brings the known gesture "...and it is!".
Pat and Matt even moved from the television screens to books, DVDs and theatre and toys or other toys with Pat and Mata are the hit of every toys.
Tale for Fiji and two-year-old Harmonia.
The end of the week is in the sign of a fairy tale, and we have chosen one sport and one of your lives for you.
Both have a good ending.
Let's see.
Fiji has achieved historical success.
What is the cause of the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
And what kind of things do people spend most on airports?
It's a Friday review from the world's websites.
The first medal of the Olympic games.
The historic success celebrates the island state of Fiji.
The Ragby choice of this island defeated the final of the Olympic tournament of the seventh football team of Great Britain.
It's the first medal that Fiji gained for himself on the Olympiade.
Waiting for the profit of the first valuable metal took sixty years since the first trip to the Olympic game.
Coach Fiji is a great credit for the success.
But it's ironic that Brit Ben Ryan is.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the final of the British citizen could be satisfied, in contrast with its countrymen.
"Let's go play free and easy and see if we can handle the biggest game in our history," the coach said before the final.
Finally, Fiji was sovereign, and a small state with 900 thousand inhabitants now experiences an Olympic story.
The report was brought by the French journal Le Monde.
New friend and luck for a little girl.
Two-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has lived without hands for 11 months and got a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," a two-year-old girl said her mother to ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes a virgin to take off her hands and legs and then sit together without proteses.
Harmonia has been diagnosed by meningitis type B during a few years of life, and the doctors only gave it a ten percent chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about.
She's beautiful, smart, funny and never gives up.
He's got an oversight.
I've seen her represent her with the other kids saying hello, I'm Harmonie and I don't have hands, mother added.
Look at what joy the doll caused.
What do we spend the most in the airport?
CNN brings findings according to which people in the airports will spend the most of them on packed water.
The Hudson's travel chamber published the data in the last year, where it summaries 10 products which customers in his airport shops buy most often.
The water was sovereignly first.
The drinks were generally very popular, and in the first ten, eight of them were placed.
The ninth place took a large pack of M&M candy with coconut taste.
And can you guess who's closing the first ten?
As one of the above things can't be eaten.
According to CNN, it's the Wall Street Journal.
Among other popular newspapers sold in airports belongs: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Veslar sovereigns.
We're just going to win, Murray and Bond laughed.
The Vesslers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond of New Zealand have sovereignly ruled the category of two without the controller for seven years and have confirmed their dominants in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first, the unborn couple went into a smaller crew after the Olympiade in Beijing and since 2009, broken competition.
At the Rodriga de Freitase laguna, they had a 69th win in the fourth final.
What are we different from the rest of us?
We're just more nice, he joked Murray already during the Olympic regate when he was going to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand couple.
Honestly, we do nothing different than others.
We're just working hard, very hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their superiority is impressive even because they are physically different.
Murray is almost two-foot and a stokile chasser, academic looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 pounds lighter.
Besides, they have a different nature.
Bond is studying and dedicated to finances, Murray has, for example, a charity boxing game.
Even that's why they don't spend much time out of the woods together.
Eric's going into the boat, basically, with the fact that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I have the tendency to think about what could be wrong, Bond admitted, which even at the press conference showed that the dominant in the crew is Murray.
He was the one who always answered the first and Bond waited for his opportunity.
But on the water, the rival is destroyed by peaceful force.
They drive their pace, and perhaps often in the middle of the trail aren't in the head, but the opponents have not yet found the prescription on their progressive acceleration.
We're running on a two-mile track, and we never wanted to drive the first mile back.
We're just trying to drive a pace that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, said a 40-year-old Murray.
With his four years of younger partner, he got seven gold medals for the world's championship.
They also triumphed in 2007, when both members were gold four without a ruler.
Just after the unexpected failure, the larger crew in the Peking Olympiade decided to sit on a two without a controller.
At the Olympians in London, the greatest defeat of their career was evidently opened and the Dominants confirmed in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it was going to be a hell of a hard time, and we had to make sure we were mentally well, Murray said.
We know everyone wants to throw us out of the throne.
We've got the target on our backs all the time.
But we're trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
Climate Model according to NASA: Venus was once resident
According to the projects of a new NASA climate model, Venus was once resident.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute of NASA for Space Study developed a model for Venus's research through tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate studies.
The model was designed to determine whether once on Venus, whose surface is hot, without water and saturated CO2 could have the conditions similar to the earth.
Scientists have already suggested that a low rotation speed of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
However, according to the latest simulations, Venus could once be proud of a rare atmosphere similar to the Earth, turning slowly.
The model was also dealt with the previous topography of Venus.
The planet was likely more dry than the earth, but once there was enough water and geographical diversity to rule life and protect against rapid departure.
Venus used the sun, which was 30 percent more exposed.
“In the simulation of the GISS Venus model, during slow rotation, he exposes his daily side to the sun almost two months at once," the scientist from GISS Anthony Del Genio explained in the new report.
This is how the surface heats and rain forms a dense layer of clouds that behave as rain and surface protect from too much solar warmth.
The result is the climate with average temperatures, which are actually a little lower than in the present time on Earth.
The model composed the story of Venus similar to the evolution that previously had been composed by the planetary scientists.
Even though Venus was probably inhabited in the past -- over a few billion years -- was exposed to too much hot and ultrafial radiation.
Her oceans went off and the water pairs were burned with ultrafial light.
The hydrogen escaped and only the dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with the death effects of glass gas -- that is Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from Venus’s new climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigned on the post coach of Colorado Avalanche
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned to his post coach and vice-president of hockey operations to Colorado Avalanche team, as a reason he stated that it was unable to participate in the decision-making process in the team's issues.
The executive vice-president/general manager of Colorada Joe Sakic confirmed the step and stated that the club would immediately be searching for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have been a chief coach and vice-president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in the statement.
I've been thinking long and intense over the years, how to improve the team, give him the depth he needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the visions of the coach and the vice-president of hockey operations must be in accordance with the vision of the organization.
It must also be able to participate in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are not met at present.
Sakic, which Roye adopted on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his benefits from the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him a good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated for the winning of Jack Adams as the best coach of the League during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to gain 112 points and the first place in the Central Division. Colorado, however, had been dealing with Minnesota in the first round of play-off and in the past two years, he has always failed to fight after the season.
Avalanche team in season 2015/2016 reached score 39:39:4 and missed five points to get the second wild card in the Western conference.
Branker Roy, who joined the Hall of Fame, won Stanley Cup four times -- twice with Montreal Canadiens and twice with Avalanche.
Workers on oil platform in the North Sea renew interviews and interrupt the strike
The top representatives of the acting parties stated that the strikes due to remuneration for oil platform workers in the North Sea have been interrupted, while all parties have argued to a new round of negotiations.
The strikes against the company for oil fields of Wood Group were sporadically occurring on platforms in the North Sea, operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
‘Wood Group and Union organisations of the Unite and RMT may confirm that they have agreed to renew the process to address current conflicts’, the declaration states.
Starting next week, we will have a series of all-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at problems from the new corners.
According to Union organisations, their recent action, which, according to their words, was first in over 25 years, to protest against remuneration shorts up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group reduced rates this year and paid its suppliers in the North Sea about 9% less because of negative market pressure.
The reduction of company rates comes after a ten-percentage reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that other shorts would provide space to compensate with market decline.
On the other hand, Shell expelled thousands of people from his payment lists and announced plans for leaving operations on the field of oil and gas in 10 countries for the modernisation of its processes - immediately after the mega fusion with the British Energy Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low oil prices, the economic situation associated with the June decision of Britain to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, a member of the Parliament of Scotland Dave Anderson met the committee's broadcast to discuss one of the biggest working disagreements of the entire generation that led to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, as he said, is vital for the economy in the region.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not only for some," he said.
For comparison, in 2016, nearly $1.4 billion is expected to invest in new projects in the North Sea, while the average for the past five years was approximately $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in Pleyads
The latest mission of Kepler's space telescope to help astronomers is to get a nearly complete list of star rotation speeds from the Playade Star.
New data helps astronomers understand why stars in the stars are rotating at different speeds, and how the rotation time relates to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star shoppings we will learn more about the relationship between star material, its age and even history in its solar system," Luisa Rebull, research worker in Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said.
The Plejada Star is located 445 light years from the Earth.
Many stars now reach the status of adulthood and have emerged over 125 million years.
Now he's turning the fastest.
In the immediate speed of rotation, these teenage stars release enormous amounts of star wind.
Because these winds are moving along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slow effect on them.
Together with the ageing of the star, it slows down its rotation speed.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star so that measures the time between the discovery of familiar points on stars -- similar to the sun scans.
According to the latest data on the speed of rotation, larger stars are rotating slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancemen, the bigger make piruets slower than those smaller.
"In the "balet" Plejad we see that more slowly flipping stars are massive, while those who rotate the fastest are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Starshop is so close, it serves as an ideal space lab to compare the quality of stars and speed of rotation.
"Playeds provide us an anchor for theoretical models of star rotation to both directions, in the younger and older stars," Rebull said.
There's still a lot we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation speed, saying "will they hang their dancing shoes on a shoe."
Rebull and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of the turning speed of Plejad in three studies, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is the qualification agreement necessary?
If I did not sign up, then would the qualification agreement not be concluded and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it at all possible to work without reporting to specialization education after delivery?
I mean, in the area where I want to work, it is now a free job only in a little remote hospital, but in about a half year, it could relax a place in another place where I would like to work afterwards.
So I don't know how to deal with the situation about half a year, the question continues.
It's Mgr. Lenka Wolk.
No legal regulation establishes a obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - hospital.
The qualification agreement is a legal institute governed by the Labour Law and may be concluded between the employer and the employer in order to ensure the recovery of the costs associated with the increase or improvement of qualifications of employees.
In the field of health, there is a long-term pressure on non-consolidation of these agreements in view of ensuring the working mobility of health workers and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No 95/2004, the conditions for obtaining and recognizing expertise and specialised eligibility to perform a healthcare of the doctor, dental pharmacist and pharmacist, while explicitly apply that the participation in specialisation education is considered to be accelerating qualification (none increase).
This means that the qualification agreement can be concluded under the Labour Law only if costs are at least 75 000 CZKs.
No legal regulation or no obligation to apply to specialise education.
The Act only lays down the conditions of the application for the inclusion in the field of specialisation education.
However, according to the law, the physician is authorised to perform a doctor's call by graduating the necessary college study, even though under the law laid down (in the specialized supervision of a doctor with specialized qualifications in the relevant field).
The Act provides for the situation where professional training of the doctor may be computed in another field of specialization, if its content and scope are in accordance with the relevant educational programme.
Theoretically, it would be possible to calculate the period of worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the situation of the questionant.
However, given that I do not know the closer circumstances of this case, it may be recommended to consult the competent Council of the Ministry of Health (Scientific and Medical Calls), since the Ministry of Health of the Law provides advice and consultation services related to the classification of specialisation and progress.
The Advisory Service is also provided freely by the Czech Medical Chamber, which must be a member of each doctor.
The doctors in Syrian Halabu are asking for an intervention of the U.S.
The United States has not made any effort to end the surroundings (rebel parts of the city of the government army), and they do not use their influence on the promotion of civilian protection, quoted from a letter addressed to the White House of AFP.
"We don't need tears, sympathy, nor even prayers; but we desperately need to create an unarmed zone above the East Halabe to stop attacks, and we need an international action to ensure that Halab will not be surrounded again," the doctors said.
