I read Tom's story.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
I'm really gonna get married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like your hair.
I really like wine.
I like your website so much.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mother's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I really want to learn French.
It would really be nice to keep your mouth shut.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the type.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember how I met the Queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I cried one.
The iron is stronger than the gold.
Isaac Newton died as a virgin.
I said I'd bring it.
I said it might rain.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Anybody in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Anything missing?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I saw him play cards with them all.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister kick the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sunshine in the washing room.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom and Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is it far from Boston?
Buddhism is religion or philosophy?
Does Dan know what he did?
Are the potatoes caloric?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see," the blind said.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are they all busy?
Are everyone happy?
Everybody's having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
His aunt eats apple or banana?
I was swing with my head.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
I should be sorry for them.
I should take her home.
I need to pack myself.
I have to go get dressed.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done that without you.
I shouldn't have eaten that ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should've asked you first.
I should've been more cultural.
I should have checked.
I should have done that yesterday.
I should've known you're gonna be here.
I should have refused.
I showed her my room.
Is he cold outside?
Is it over?
Is he far from here?
Is Daddeba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I've got his screwed up.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I'm sleeping standing.
I slept like a slaughter.
I was asleep in the shop.
I slept in the bus.
I crossed the sandwich.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic drinks?
I smiled.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that too much?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this awesome?
I kind of like it.
I've been cleaning snow all day.
Is she a cab?
Is she pregnant or is she just fat?
Is she really that beautiful?
Is that your mother?
I was staring at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I got something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a retorical question?
That means "yes" or "no"?
Is there any of that word at all?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that Sarcasam?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So there's Tom?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is the delivery paid?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there any food?
Anybody else?
Anybody else here?
Is there sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a prize?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is it a real diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this true in English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is this your radio?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is this place free?
Was this all the excitement?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
Somehow I still can't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still like a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Does Tom contribute?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying from cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is Tom looking for them?
Is Tom bothering you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Are you talking to Tom?
Is Tom alone there?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I burned a kybrit in the dark.
I'm learning history of art.
Suddenly, I felt old.
I'm suffering from astma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest that we focus on the request for an exit from the cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm starving you to get down.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's all right.
That's what I doubted.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I swimmed in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't even get to burn with you and you're the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Does the freezer still work for you?
Is your head full of slam?
I use a chance to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my advisors about what items to take.
It all makes sense.
It looks intentless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't be a coincidence.
So it wasn't.
It's not possible!
It's for you.
It was a lot more than I expected.
Never, but really never, it could have happened here.
There's no way Tom was.
That would be a disaster.
It would be good.
You didn't bother me.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get so bad.
It's disappointed.
It would look good.
I don't mind.
It's not gonna get better.
It doesn't seem much different.
It doesn't matter you don't want to do it; anyway you have to.
It doesn't matter.
Looks like it doesn't help.
It doesn't sound like anyone knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I'm learning English.
I'm in the way.
That gave me an idea.
I have something to do.
It had to be made.
It must have come from somewhere.
Depends on your decision.
It happened too soon.
It's happening.
It's happening.
It's cold.
There's nothing to do with luck.
It wasn't easy for us.
He's got a sentimental value.
I've been thinking it all days.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think she's right.
I think she's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one of them.
I think I'm cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I think I'm going to eat outside.
I think I'll go see Tom and see how he is.
I think I love you.
I think I made a good statement.
I think I write pretty well.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think it's possible to sneeze.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French pretty well.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it'd be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time to start preparing.
I think it's time to go.
I think it's time to start preparing.
I think it would be a mistake to borrow Tom's money.
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
I think I was wrong.
I think maybe I can help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel will be a little expensive.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's ridiculous.
I think that's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's insensitive.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom's brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom is beautiful.
I think Tom's cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's mean.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's tiny.
I think Tom's a chain.
I think Tom is rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's stuck.
I think Tom's undenied.
I think Tom's intelligent.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I'm saying Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's going.
I think we can get him.
I think it's better not drink water.
We'd better not go out on a storm like this.
I think we'll join.
I think we're close to the solution.
I think we're done.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we need to wait a little longer.
I think we've eaten enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you'll have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this yourself.
I mean, help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should handle this yourself.
I think you've helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I meant you.
I thought there were bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask for help.
I thought I lost all the money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought it was messing with me.
I thought you already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom was retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to come with us.
So we didn't agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd go to the museum together.
I think you'll have a lot of work to do.
So you didn't want the prize?
I thought you found another.
I thought you lost your manual clock.
So don't you hate him?
We seemed tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you were only dating girls that were lower than you.
Well, didn't you know how to play the piano?
Well, didn't you say you know how to swim?
So didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I thought you were better playing chess than I did.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you'd live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning to stay in bed all day.
I thought you weren't gonna be busy.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
It hurts me awfully.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the hat out of the cup.
It's a multi-factory process.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no theoretical way to do the job in one day.
Today's less wet than yesterday.
It's not cold.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use it?
I'm paying.
It's not coming into consideration.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It starts to come into our mind that we can't ignore the nature.
It's warm today than yesterday.
It is worth quoting a famous passage of his essay.
It's on the forehead.
It's written on his face.
It seems kind of wrong to me.
I just don't feel safe about that.
It just sounds boring.
It's happening all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be Christmas soon.
It'll be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
It looked horrible.
It looked funny.
Looks like you're right.
It looks very delicious.
It looks different.
It seems familiar to me.
It looks like eggs.
Looks like I drank too much yesterday.
Looks like these two are back in a relationship.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
Looks like we're going to have a snow Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
Looks nice.
That made me closer to Tom.
He's screwing me up.
It's anxious.
It could be dangerous.
Maybe it'll be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
Maybe it sounded like a suggestion, but it was a order.
Maybe it'll rain tonight.
Maybe it seems weird.
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It's possible to rain today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It must be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them and told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me that time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I couldn't.
I told you it'd be hard to get out.
I told you my father died when I was 13 years old.
I told you this would get awkward.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I broke up.
I'm back on the bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants have ripped off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally understand.
It's probably not worth waiting.
It rained two days ago.
He's been doing a lot of difficulties.
I tried to explain to him, but he didn't push.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to make him come.
I tried to make them stop.
I tried to pretend I'm something I'm not.
I really regret that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
It's about to rain.
It's a classic.
It was a catastrophe!
It is recommended that you see if there are any negative effects when you drink alcohol while drinking the prescribed medicine.
It's a child game.
That's a good system.
Everything's in the file.
It's all in the room.
It's all over.
It's all over now.
That's all they're talking about.
It's all so weird.
It's almost over.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's gonna have to go.
It's really fun.
It's seven o'clock.
It's eleven o'clock.
It's already open.
It's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you've survived.
It's a honour.
There's nothing to think.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
It's a reasonable compromise.
It's a fake trail.
It's a risky plan.
Too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
It's fast to get out of here.
It's a simple thing.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
He's dissolved.
It's just anxiety.
It's been raining for a week, up and down.
Three weeks went after Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is incredibly warm.
It'd be best if you didn't talk so much.
You better be alone.
Better be optimistic and foolish than pessimistic and right.
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
Sauna's here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's no one here.
It's time to close.
He's studying here.
It's generally known that you don't like Tom.
It's dark here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to evaluate his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to end up in jail than then to escape.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
Looks like I've misjudged it.
It looks like her style.
It seems to me that it's the only possible conclusion.
Looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's evil to be psyched.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
That's exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Looking at TV is fun.
She's dressed.
It's dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's gonna be beast.
It'll get cold.
It'll happen soon.
It's good to see you all again.
That's a good training.
It's okay.
It's improved.
It's so funny.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's warm here in hell.
That's supposed to be possible.
It shouldn't even take a long time.
I don't care what you think about Tom.
It's impossible for him to quit smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
He's in a great state.
He's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's a simple question.
It's just invented.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It's made of skin.
It's my decision, Tom.
That's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring such gifts.
It's nice to feel that someone needs you.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's noise here.
It's none of your business!
It's not a secret that Tom doesn't agree with you.
That's not a big priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not back.
That's not exactly what happened.
It will not be easy to do it without great help.
It's not hard to emphasize if you're surrounded by fools.
It's no big deal.
It's not just guessing.
It's not usually a pen.
There's not enough light to read here.
It's not that we're doing something.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
It's not necessary.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too early.
It's not up to you.
It doesn't happen very often to someone buy a thousand dollars hat.
It's not worth much.
Snow was falling last night.
It's obviously a print error.
It's obvious for everyone he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
Sounds really strong.
Sounds very good.
It's our job to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
Probably still there is.
It's probably still available.
It's broken.
Actually, it's very common.
That's delicious.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
It's quite possible that Tom doesn't help us at all.
It's very simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really nasty.
It's a shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's strong!
It's a law!
It's so obvious that we don't need evidence.
It's getting dark.
It's still dark out there.
He's still on sale.
He's still working.
It's still not good.
Still growing.
He's still there.
It's strange how people in tropical zones eat coated food like a carrie.
It's stuck.
His surface was as flat as a mirror.
It's time for it again.
This is the best puppet I've ever tasted.
It's a spider casnate.
I'm so scared!
It's time for you to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
He's very strong.
It's bullshit.
It's totally wrong.
It's not sustained.
It's unique and unreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom urgently.
She's very relaxing.
It's very simple to understand.
It's warm in here.
I guess I don't.
There's a wind.
It's from work.
You're losing.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
The water takes only three minutes to scream.
It lasted all night.
It took a lot more than I thought it would take.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're unexpectedly beautiful.
I switched the ventilator and directed it to the wall.
I turned the lamp on.
I turned off the TV.
I refused Tom.
It was a great honour to be asked to speak.
It was so beautiful.
That was embarrassing.
It was at midnight.
This was an all-day.
It was a great series.
It was all my idea.
It was okay here.
It was all so easy.
That was an amazing night.
It was an ambush.
It was a terrible view.
It was a honour.
That was a offer I couldn't deny.
It was my pleasure to spend the evening with a smart, funny, beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
That was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a warm night.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful night.
Such behaviour was childish by him.
It was disgusting.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was one of them.
It was fun yesterday.
He was sleeping all night.
It was dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
Nice of you to have bought Tom such a nice gift.
It was nice of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It wasn't easy for me to admit that I was wrong.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It is proven that dogs living in dogs jump higher than those living in cats.
It was so magnificent.
It was pretty funny.
It was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
You've been blowing a lot.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to plane.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
You were still there.
Tom gave me the picture that was hanged on the chimney.
It was Tom.
It was too little.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was inappropriate.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very drowning in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Batter.
It was worth a try.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It's not gonna be enough.
I'm not gonna be lonely here.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
It won't help lies.
That won't help you.
It's doing good.
It would be very normal to be angry with Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you by tomorrow if I catch up to explain everything to you.
I need you urgently.
I've been watching you before.
I used to dream of being a balerine.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I've already packed it.
I've already read it.
I already wrote everything I had to write.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
Someone always helped me.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get to one like this.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've already asked everyone.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked her cake.
I baked their cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little burdened with another.
I turned the whole town looking for Dom.
It was much worse for me.
They betrayed me.
They informed me.
I've been robbed three times this month.
I've been calling for hours.
I was a mess.
I was unreasonable.
I can't wait to meet him.
I was gone for three weeks.
I was happy here.
I offered her help.
I've been offering help.
They hired me to find them.
I was kidnapped.
I've been living here for years.
I've been looking for him for a while.
I was pretty busy.
I've been looking for you for a while.
I've been learning French since I was 13 years old.
I was thinking about your problem with Tom.
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I've seen it before.
I came for them.
I came to get him a gift.
I cut my finger off.
I decided to contribute exclusively with Spanish sentences all month.
I decided to forgive him.
I decided to forgive them.
I decided to go on the train.

You can't take that from me.
You can't treat me like this.
You can use my car.
You can use this car.
You can use this pen.
You're getting the data quickly.
You're cooking a bowl with bulbs.
You may be wrong.
You could have refused.
You'd be a great mother.
You better ask them first.
To find them.
You better go help him.
You better go.
You better let me do that.
You deserve a medal.
You deserve a higher salary.
He deserved better.
You would've done the same in my place.
You've done a bad job.
You did your job nicely.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
Didn't you know Tom was a gay guy?
You didn't listen.
You didn't see anyone coming in, did you?
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
You told Tom about it, didn't you?
You've already done it.
You've done your best.
You don't have to like everything.
You don't even like fish.
You got it, didn't you?
Do you have a key by chance?
You don't have any idea how long.
You don't have to be crazy to work here.
You know my motherfucker.
You don't know anything.
You dream you know.
You don't really like Tom, do you?
You shouldn't be present for this.
You don't have to go.
You don't need to panic.
You don't have to wear anything like this.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
You don't understand business.
You don't want to do something that reminds them you're not really big enough to be here.
You don't want to go, do you?
You don't work here.
You're driving me crazy.
You forgot your backpack!
You scared Tom.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
You're right to a phone call.
You go get Tom and go back.
You hit one thing.
You're wrong, people.
You were right, guys.
Your hair is a fracture.
You hate us, don't you?
You've got a great job.
You're biting your conscience, aren't you?
You have a habit that I don't like.
You've got tiny chests.
You have beautiful lips.
You were a great mentor for me.
You were busy.
You have sweet eyes.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
I respect you.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
There's no reason to be afraid.
You don't change your mind, do you?
You didn't see that, did you?
You haven't solved this problem, did you?
You have a really good handwriting.
Your hands are soft.
You have to answer the question.
You have to ask them first.
You have to buy them a gift.
You have to go home.
You have to help him.
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
You have to resign.
You have to sit down.
You have to stay away from him as far as you can.
You can't lose your condition.
You have to try, Tom.
You have very beautiful lips.
You've got a lot of screwed eyes.
You just heard.
You just got back from vacation.
You almost missed him.
You almost missed Tom.
You don't get involved in this.
Kids, you should stay here.
You knew, didn't you?
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
You know I'm not eating meat.
You know me better than you think.
You know me too well.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
You're learning fast.
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
You left me in despair.
You let Tom escape.
You want your life, don't you?
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be confused.
You'll be in danger.
You'll be my guests.
You'll be familiar with time.
You'll feel better.
You're gonna get a copy.
You'll feel better.
You'll get them back.
They're gonna make you whiskey.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
You're going with me!
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You'll have to learn better next year.
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
You're gonna need a ticket to travel the bus.
You're gonna have to sit still.
You'll never find her.
They'll never take you to that club.
You'll never guess.
You'll never know.
You'll understand when it's time.
You looked beautiful.
You look familiar to me.
You look beautiful.
You look pretty bad.
You look so good.
You look sad.
You look fantastic.
You look very handsome, Tom.
You've earned something.
You gave your word.
You're upset me.
Maybe you'll need you.
You can go anywhere.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
You can sleep here.
It wouldn't be bad if you slowed down.
You met my sister, right?
Maybe you can help them.
You have to be careful.
You must be confused.
I'm sure it's been a lot of relief.
You must have jumped.
You must be very proud.
You must be strong.
You have to show yourself first.
You have to forgive me.
You have to help her.
You have to watch the kid.
You can't give up.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
You have to learn worthy.
You need a friend.
You need a good woman.
You need to buy some sugar.
You should do it somewhere else.
You should make him listen.
You should grow up and grow up a little.
You need to help her.
You need to help me find him.
You need to hurry.
You should do this to work.
You didn't ask why.
He didn't give us a chance.
We only have one life.
One is life.
You need to create a habit to wash your teeth after every meal.
You should go to the dentist.
You don't owe me anything.
You're paying me very well.
You chose a good one.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
It's gone in red.
You ran as fast as you could.
You're burning the car.
You're burning the car.
Your complaints made me upset.
Your offences disappointed your ancestors' graves.
Your demands are unreasonable.
Your desserts are attractive, but we're sick.
You're ready to cry.
You're absolutely right.
You're a man.
You're acting weird.
You're a brook.
You're a fraud.
You're after them.
You're a good son.
You're a kind man.
You're all cowards.
You're all the same.
You're really good.
But you lied to her.
You really need a psychiatrist.
You really should have let me call a cab.
You're always tired.
You're a moron.
You're nobody and nothing.
You're a pig.
You're a prisoner.
You're racist.
You're such an asshole.
You're smart.
You're a discreet man.
You're a wise man.
You're mean.
You're busy, aren't you?
You're capable, but you're screwing up.

You're influenced.
You took my place.
You're in no danger.
You're interesting.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
You're weakened from me.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're lucky.
You're lying to me.
You're angry with me, I can know.
You're amazing.
You're anxious about Tom.
You're my neighbor.
You're not my friend.
You're not that young anymore.
You're not a freak.
You're not a woman.
You're not dressed.
You're not gonna find me.
You won't find them.
You're not gonna find us.
You're under her level.
You're under his level.
You're not ready yet, are you?
You're not that horrible.
You don't suggest we give Tom all the money, do you?
You're not that old, Tom.
You're not too old for her.
You can go now.
You're crazy!
But you're smart.
You're our guests.
You don't have any more alcohol.
You've got too much work to do.
You're specific.
You're part of our team.
You're a pessimist.
You're poor.
You're predictable.

You're with Tom, right?
You misjudged it.
You're wrong, Tom.
You're lying, Tom.
Your eyes look strange.
Your future begins today.
Your hair smells like spring.
You're too squeezing when you're handling.
Why don't you go to the doctor?
Your house is very beautiful.
Your memory's good.
Your moon's coming back.
Your mother put your collage in the top drawer.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
Your way's hard.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
Your excuse is more or less accurate.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
Your faith is disgusting.
Your role here is so important.
Your shelf is full of books.
There's yours.
Your sister's asleep.
Your sons are pretty handsome.
All your things are here.
Your desires are my command.
Your patent is untied.
That's what you said about an hour ago.
You told me to call anytime.
You said we'd never catch her.
You said you'd help.
You said you'd write me a message at night, but you lied to me, obviously.
You saved my life.
You look disoriented.
You seem to know the answer already.
You look like you're cold.
You seem to have an infection.
Looks like it's hard for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
Do you share his interest in this book?
You need to ask for help.
You should ask Tom.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Don't be exaggerated.
You should be happy for them.
You should be proud.
You should eat less red meat.
You should eat more.
You should feel flattered.
You need to get some sleep.
You should give him some space.
You should give them some space.
You should go help him.
You should go to bed early.
You just need to talk to Tom.

You only got 65.
You should try it.
You should try this.
You should try to write respect.
You should have asked her first.
You should wear a helmet while you drive a motorcycle.
You should write a letter of thanks to Tom.
You smell like shit.
You sound like it makes it easier.
You sound very sure.
You pulled your neck.
You're so beautiful.
You're really talking a lot.
You're talking too much about Boston.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
Traitor!
You two are very cute together.
You used to be so funny.
You used to love Boston.
You're back.
They drunk you.
You've experienced a car accident, but you'll be fine.
We missed you.
It was very useful for us.
You're right from the beginning.
You were making white again!
You bought something to Mary.
You beat me.
You beat them.
You've done so much.
You scared her.
She's overreacted!
You've got a rash.
You're loaded enough with anxiety.
You got me completely wrong.
I promise you.
You do now, don't you?
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
You have to let me go home.
You have to work together.
You unfortunate Tom.
You jumped a button.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
You've been delaying this too long.
You saw what I could do.
You were incredible.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
You were lucky that you survived the attack.
You made a mistake.
It's not that you were wrong.
You were right, Tom.
He was driving fast.
You were great.
You're not sleeping all night, are you?
He was very brave.
You were wrong about the picture.
You will do as I command.
You'll find your toys and your books.
You're not gonna need that.
You're not gonna make it.
You won't win.
You're too worried about him.
You wouldn't want to be late.
Yeah, I'm angry.
