FANO of Russia will hold the final Expert session
The Federal Scientific Organization Agency (FANO of Russia) will conduct a third Expert session " Assessment of the Efficiency of Scientific Organizations " .
The meeting will be concluding in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, as reported in the press release in the edition of Lenta.Ru.
The Third Assembly is planning to summarize the outcome of the work of the Expert Session for a year and provide a summary of indicators to assess the effectiveness of scientific organizations.
Participants plan to discuss the rules of establishing expert groups responsible for assessing the work of scientific groups and the evaluation criteria.
The Third Expert Session will be a final event in a row of events to form a single for all three academy approach to the evaluation of the effectiveness of scientific organizations.
In the past five months, we have achieved this, and the final version of the regulatory instruments is in the harmonization.
As a result of the next session, we must complete the establishment of scientific and expert analysis processes, agreement on stages and evaluation dates," said the head of the FANO expert-analytical management of Russia, Elena Axenova.
Over a hundred scientific institutions of Russia will participate in the event.
The adoption of the resolution was expected.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. at Moscow time on 16 September 2014 at the city of Moscow, Solanca Street, house 14.
Scientists have found a way to discover relative stars
Astrophysics from the University of California in Santa Cruise have studied the turbulent mixture and its impact on chemical monumentality in star bunches.
The discovery of experts is expected to allow to search for relatives among stars, i.e. from one cluster.
The results of their studies have been published in Nature’s magazine and can be briefed on the university website.
The same chemical ingredient of the nearest stars is a turbulent mixture in gas clouds pre-educing stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the star cluster, it can be defined by its chemical composition where it is born and the area of the families' education.
Scientists had previously doubted that the evolution of the star outside the cluster could lead to the differences in its chemical content from the family in the cluster.
The results of astrophysics modelling show that such differences should not occur.
In their research, supercomputer experts designed two interstar gas flows that formed the cloud together.
This object has been transformed by its own gravity for several million years in a cluster in which the stars begin to form.
Scientists added tag colors to the original gas flows and found that rapid turbulent mixture in the cloud achieved a high degree of chemical uniformity.
The astrophysics believe that their studies have shown that the chemical stars can be searched, as well as the possible areas of the education of such objects.

Lavrov: Russia will not " knock the door" in connection with new sanctions and will not come out of WTO
Russia will not "push the door" for new sanctions.
The head of MID RF, Sergei Lavrov, stated today, speaking to the students and teachers of IGIMO.
With regard to our response to the new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even consider, fantasize, because everything must be calculated specifically," he said.
And when we realize what European and American partners will like this once, we will decide how to respond.
This will not be linked to the hammering doors, some of the insults understood falsely," the Minister stressed.
We will, first of all, be distracted from our interests, interests to protect our economy, our social sphere, our citizens, our business and make conclusions from partners' actions on their adequacy, agreement and reliability.
Following the steps taken in the field of sanctions, the partners can be judged very well, " continued the head of MID RF.
If they say "they sanctions will also be painful for us, but we are forced to go to the punishment of Russia," it is probably not very adequate."
With regard to the WTO exit of the RF in response to possible new sanctions, no.
On the contrary, we want more actively to obtain the WTO tools, including when dealing with trade disputes, said Lavrov.
We have already launched this tool to overcome, as we believe, the EU's discriminatory policy against anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia was accused of deming and applied anti-dumping measures against the RF industry.
"We are ready to engage WTO mechanisms and to stand for our position of inadmissibility to apply the EU's third energy standards retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How is it right to use the cheese in the garden design?
The question is answered by Irina Okuneva:
Since the syrene has lost its primary attraction, it is desirable to be planted with other crustaceans.
It is greatly connected with many cultures.
In addition to the siren, both plants decorative in other periods can be planted and flourished at the same time.
Another plus siren is that it provides a mass of creative opportunities.
You can form it with a different height, an improved bush, a widely founded mushroom, and even a kind of garden bonsay, a tree with a marvelously scrambled bullet.
Just choose the form that fits the design of your garden.
In Carelia, the inhabitant of the Leningrad area is convicted for the purchase of false money
As reported in the Republican IMD, the man was engaged in his criminal activities in Olonec and Seguez regions.
In addition to Carelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already succeeded in the Vologa area where he was sentenced to two and a half years of detention.
Later, the man was presented to the Olonian District Court.
In order to end the investigation of the crimes committed in our Republic, it was staged in Segage.
A number of episodes of counterfeit money by summer 2013 have been proven to be guilty.
At the end of June this year, the criminal proceedings with the accusation were sent to court.
On Friday, on 29 August, the court decided to replace the term of deprivation for four years with a general regime colony.
The sentence has not entered the legal force.
Recall, last week, two other counterfeiters were convicted in the Petroteausc shops.
Citizens of Azerbaijan also arrived in Carelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them has been deprived of five years, the one is four.
Everyone has a fine of 500,000 rubles.
The sentence has not yet entered the legal force.
In Archangel, 73th anniversary of the first convoy, Dervish
The meeting held in the area centre was dedicated to the first arctic convoy.
Dervish delivered military assistance from the United States and Britain to the SSSR.
In Archangel, the memorial of the stone was held at the future monument for the participants of the northern convoys, located at the Sedova Coast name in Solombala.
At the event, representatives of the veteran organizations of Archangel, children from the Cadet class, were gathered.
The first time we gathered for twenty-three years ago when the stone was found.
But at the same time, the event is not a celebration, but the day of memory of those who have not returned to the sea," said the President of the Northern Maritime Navy Council, Boris Karpov.
Then the city's spirit orchestra spoke at the event, and the cadetic teachers gave flowers to the veterans and marched with the Russian flags and the victory flag.
The mitting ended with the planting of flowers to the stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English ships and one Dutch transport loaded with strategicly important commodity (10,000 tonnes of cauchuka, 1,500 tons of formed shoes, lead, wool and many other inventory and equipment).
Furthermore, there were military equipment and weapons - 3,800 depth bombs and magnetic mines, 15 Harriquein killers, in deployed state.
At the same time, the escort of the convoy consisted of 16 UKF ships, including two aircraftmen.
The caravan was not discovered by the opponent and reached the appointment of Archangel.
A total of 848 ships involved in the vital caravan operations were killed by 126 transport and about 50 military vessels.

Recalling the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill that protects trade unions as civil law.
"Where trade unions, there are middle-class jobs," said Allison, a democrat from Minnesota, who is a co-Chairman of the Congress of the Progressive Fraction.
That is why I proudly represent the Act on the Expansion of the Rights of Workers, along with the symbol of movement for civil rights, John Lewis.
This innovative law will give workers the same legal possibilities in discrimination in the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of opponents of trade unions
Amendment of the Labour Relations Act in order to allow workers faced with discrimination for participation in trade unions to seek justice in civil courts and to receive compensation for damage and penalties is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is not a radical initiative, at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what Allison, Lewis and the co-autors of the draft law are to remember a very American idea.
Despite the attacks that trade unions have been attacked in the past years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country, Americans have once supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labour rights.
There was still a time that millions of Americans remembered while the country was at the same time protecting democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of printing and the right to organization.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas McArtur and his assistants helped the country to adopt a constitution so as to guarantee that the military autocracy of Hideca Todzo was replaced by democracy.
In full awareness that workers and their trade unions play a role in creating a new Japan, they included a text that directly recognized that “the right of workers to organization and to negotiations and to collective action is guaranteed”.
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his assistants helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in a new State, the Germans included an article that openly stated: " The right to establish associations to protect and improve labour and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each person and to each profession or sphere of activity.
Agreements that restrict or strive to compromise this right will not have legal force; measures aimed at these purposes will be recognized as illegal.
When the former Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which composed the World Declaration on Human Rights, which would be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the composers included a guarantee that “eachone has the right to organize and join the trade unions to protect its interests”.
For generations, Americans have accepted the proper basic situation that labour rights are human rights.
When the country consulted other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to the organisation of trade unions - and that the trade union should participate as an equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government institutions - should be protected.
Now that these rights are subjected to attacks in America, wisely, to return to the American ideal that employees should have the right to organize and to hear their votes in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Younger said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the forces of the nation, but increased them.
By increasing the living level of millions, trade unions have miraculously created a market for industry and have raised the whole nation to the unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers what we should do.
Official recognition of labour rights as human rights and enlargement of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination against trade unions has been long-term.
Keith Allison and John Lewis have restored ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
The judge is interimly blocking the law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
In the United States, the Federal Judge temporarily blocked the introduction of Louisiana's law, which his advocates say he would probably close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed to the Governor of Louisiana, Bobby Ginald in June, and had to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who have aborted would have the mandate to receive patients in the hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
Nevertheless, the judge's decision meant that doctors can continue to aborte legally by continuing to seek such powers.
"The claimants will be permitted to work legally, continuing with the receipt of power," Judge John deGrewells wrote in his decision.
The hearing will be appointed within the month where the judge will make a more permanent decision under this law.
Protecters of the right to abortion welcomed this decision, the latest in a row of decisions against similar measures, saying that this would give doctors more time to receive hospital powers.
"Today, the decision guarantees that women of Louisiana will be protected from a fake law, which seeks to deprive their health and rights," said Nancy Nortap, President and Head of the Reproductive Rights Centre, which has filed a suit against the act of the three of the five clinics of the State.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision was made to doctors from two clinics who did not speak to the prosecutors in this case, and also made an application for the recruitment authority.
Louisiana is in 11 States that have adopted such laws, and the courts have recently recognized such measures as non-constitutional measures in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked by the federal judge on Friday.
Abortion law fighters, along with the American College of Acushers and Guinecloss and the American Medical Association, say that the laws on the authorizations of reception imposed limitations not necessary in medical terms.
Abortion opponents object that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, although some also noted their positive effects in closing the clinic.
Only one doctor who has abortions in Louisiana has the power to receive in the hospital, said the Reproductive Rights Centre.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop doing this procedure, the doctor, fearing for his safety, would have ceased the procedure, said the group.
In criticizing this decision, Louisiana officials said that they would not punish abortion doctors as long as their claims for authority were to be taken.
What will lead to the introduction of quotas on domestic products
At least half of the goods of each type of goods in the trading network assortiment should be Russian production, the Deputy of the State of Just Russia, Oleg Neal, believes.
The parliamentary drafted a bill aimed at introducing protection measures against domestic producers, the report " Notifications " .
The document will be further detailed in order to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This concerns the goods that are not produced in Russia. "...> According to the other groups of products produced in Russia, the rhythler will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic producers," Neil reported.
In addition to the amendments to the article “Of the grounds for public trade management in RF”, the draft legislation provides for the amendment of the Tax Code, which sets a 10 per cent lower rate of NDCs in the implementation of the products produced in Russia.
The idea to introduce a 50 per cent quota in trade networks is a package of stimulating measures for Russian producers.
There will be several times more domestic goods.
However, the initiative may have both positive and negative effects, say experts.
According to the Tax Advocate, a member of the independent Centre for Public Justice, Sergei Lithuinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for domestic agricultural and food sectors, the effect will be positive and will lead to growth.
Furthermore, selhose producers, farmers, small shops.
They can sell more, which means profits will grow.
Furthermore, they will have the right to dictate their conditions and prices to the rhythmers, as they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, leading to higher taxes than before.
This will increase the budget income, create new jobs, some sectors will begin to expand, some faster gain, contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, indeed not at once," said the expert.
Rather, Russian companies were often unable to break into local shops because of high competition by foreign analogies.
Now, after the introduction of the embargo, it is free and it can be relieved.
However, we should not forget that, after all the necessary agreements and sanitation checks on the Russian market, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will come.
In other words, the moment of silence has come when the former players are already gone and the news have not yet come.
Almost a month later, we can talk about the growing demand for domestic raw materials and the increase in prices for prepared products," said Aif.ru, the first vice-president of the Russian public organization, the Russian Financial Directors Club, the name of Tamara Kasianova.
Clearly, the idea to sell at least 50 per cent of Russian food products would allow the local producers to strengthen the sector.
In that case, they will compete with each other, rather than with goods that are cheaper from the grants of another State.
In other words, the fight for the buyer will be deployed between companies working on one industry law.
On the other hand, Casianova notes, the Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of the communities far from all the articles.
And in this situation, trade networks will have to "train" the share of Russian goods up to half the assortiment.
In this regard, fears are increasing that invaluable goods will be invaded.
Possibly, abroad products with broken labels will be placed in Russia,” adds the expert.
The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will be experienced by major trade networks, especially those who are more benefited from collaboration with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers will be affected by such arrangements, as the demand for their products will be reduced.
Lithuanianko notes that the law on quotas on domestic goods may also affect consumers.
The point is that some Russian production products can be declined by quality of import analogies, while shops can raise prices for seconds as deficit.
Forgotten in the early 2000s, the idea of importing the economies had been reiterated in February this year because of the continuing devalvation of rubber.
The issue of discontinuation of import products has now become even more relevant in the context of difficult relations with the West.
The law is designed to commit rhythlers in orders for suppliers to be treated with domestic producers.
Then we will go far faster and more surely on the road of imports and the production planning system will be established at a shorter time," said Deputy Oleg Neilov.
The agricultural sectors, where the potential is particularly high, for example, in the breast sector, where imports shared 25 per cent.
Our farmers are truly capable of covering the Russian stores.
Furthermore, a powerful impulse can be obtained by meat production.
It is known that the largest import share remains from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.
65-70 per cent of the Russian product is still incurred," Casianova decides.
Experts believe that the introduction of quotas on domestic products will facilitate importation and may accelerate the process.
However, this initiative will not lead to importing itself, as it requires a set of measures, as Lithuianko is certain.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under this initiative could still be imported outside the border, which means that full imports will not occur, but significant steps will be made in that direction.
Furthermore, there are little quotas to be established, and there is still a need to set up the production of domestic products in the country to carry out these quotas.
Such guarantees will be provided by the quotas,” states the expert.
Inappropriate diagnosis and lack of access to optimum treatment mean that the cancer of eggs in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of their dead mother, who died of the cancer of eggs in 2007.
Women who are forgiven in the rural area of Australia face a higher risk of death from the cancer of eggs than the cities.
Researchers analyzed more than 1100 Australian women with diagnosis in 2005, discovering that only 35 per cent had lived five years after diagnosis had been diagnosed.
The leading researcher Susan Jordan of the Institute of Medical Research, QIMR Berghofer, reported that the possibility of death during the study was 20 per cent higher in those living in regions and remote areas of the state than those living in urban areas.
NEW TRAINING: New medicines may slow the cancer of lungs and egg cancer
The researchers tracked the medical path of women for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, type of egg cancer, current diseases and social economic status had also affected the probability of survival.
Women of older age and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote areas of the state, the probability of death during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women outside the cities are more likely to die from egg cancer, Dr. Jordan assumed that the unsuitable diagnosis and lack of access to optimum treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynekological oncology, and they are primarily in large cities," she said.
Despite improving the quality of television services in order to reduce the impact of the distance, she assumed that the increase in the number of travel services that would allow professionals to treat women closer to home, and the support programmes for people who have been treated far from their home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of the geographical situation, the study found that the length of life among women with cancer of eggs was rare, stressing the need for more effective strategies for treatment and prevention.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at 33 years of age, a young mother from the Golden Coast, Elisha Nev, said that she had an aggressive form of egg cancer.
A new FAP door will be opened in the Kugener region in September
The construction of a medical institution in the village of Toktajbelak was launched in April this year and conducted by a typical project.
The cost of work was almost 10 million rubles.
According to the management of public relations and information of the Chief of Mary El, the funding of building the facility was carried out through the Republican budget in accordance with the addressed investment programme.
The overall area of the treatment prevention agency is almost 230 square meters.
This will provide medical assistance to the inhabitants of eight settlements: villages of Toktaibeljak and villages of Dementievo, Püncherumal, Tunisia, Fomici, Toraibeljak, Shinur and Chashkayal.
The new Feldshire-Acusher item will replace the existing FAP, whose building was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resources, and its premises are not satisfied with the sanitation and hygiene requirements.
The new agency will be opened soon.
The killer of a four-month son, in a treasure state, will be presented in court.
Shechšia's resident will be at a camp of defendants for the murder of their own child.
In Cheboxas, the investigation of a criminal case against a 31-year-old inhabitant of New Cheboxarska accused of caution.
The investigation concluded that on 26 July this year, the accused and the four-month son arrived to celebrate the birthday of their mate in Cheboxar.
After a long time, a newboxer decided to stay in visit and put the child to sleep.
When the baby woke up and cried at night, a brilliant woman put him along with her bed to feed her breast, but soon she fell asleep.
During the sleep, a woman was hit by a son, which resulted in a drowning.
The Criminal case, reported by the CCPC press service on Chuchisha, is addressed to the court.
Inflation left the vacation.
Will the Russians feel abrupt price growth
As a result of cross sanctions, the inflation in Russia will be accelerated and not incorporated into the prognosis of the authorities, convinced by WTB Capital.
In the opinion of experts, the implications of anti-suppressions will lead to inflational shock in the first quarter of 2015, says the RBK Daily.
According to the last mineconomic projection, inflation would be 6.5 to 7.5 per cent in 2014, in the next year and less than 6.5 per cent.
However, according to the Commersante newspaper, this week, the MER should make " small, but principled " adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast until 2017.
According to the publications, the Office may reduce the inflation assessment for 2015, allowing the expected reimbursement of the population ' s income.
The project suggested that RF's food sanctions existed until August 2015.
How could such a high inflation be assumed?
The current situation implies a renewable shock, but the degradation of inflation will not change," said the report source in Minfin.
The Economists from the Capital TV did not share the expectations of the Government ' s financial-economic bloc on inflation and predict an increase in prices in 2014 at 8 per cent.
The main effect of product bans will be in conjunction with the possible introduction of sales tax in the RF regions (NPP) in 2015, the experts are convinced.
Inflational peak is going to be 9 per cent in February, after which the annual price growth rate will fall, the experts believe.
By the way, last week, Rosstat showed the first inflation results after the RF introduced "cautionary sanctions " .
Aif.ru questioned experts and identified their inflational expectations.
Artem of Deev, head of the FC AForex Analytical Department:
Price growth is already observed on the main segments of goods.
Furthermore, when the socially significant products began to be valued, the Government had to launch systemic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risks of unfounded price increases in short-term prospects.
The suppliers and rhythmers are already reporting on a daily basis to regulators so that the authorities know exactly who, when and why it initiates price increases.
The key factors for the increase in consumer price index continue to remain the abundant rate of capital flow, the excessive refinance of the banking sector by the Russian megagulator, the internal conversion of the population ' s escape to foreign currency and the embargo on the import of food goods from countries joined in sanctions against Russia.
If the inflation pressure remained under control, the cost of the minimum set of products would not be 12 per cent for one quarter.
The prohibition of imports of food goods caused a shock of proposals in the internal market and led to a totally logical increase in the final cost.
Since at the current stage, we do not fully run the importing mechanism and increase the self-sufficientness of the Russian market by domestic production, the responsive sanctions will continue to risk inflational growth.
If there are also fiscal reasons for the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the deteriorated economic growth prospects, by the end of this year, the inflation could exceed 8 per cent.
Alexander Razavaev, Director of the Analytical Department of Alpari
In the 1990s, the inflation sometimes reached 20 to 30 per cent a month, and also above the current level, the other thing that was compensated for rapid economic growth.
I think, after the end of the year, inflation will be 8-8.5%.
Platoon of Maguta, UK Asset Management Fund Maguta
The external factor in Russia ' s sanctions has been successfully restrained, but if further pressures occur, primarily, to the financial sector, it may lead to certain difficulties and increase inflation expectations of the population, which are traditionally manifested in the purchase of cash currency in order to safeguard their savings.
It could be assumed that the Government, the RF and the Ministry of Finance would try to mitigate the smooth weakening of rubber by both market methods and public regulations.
However, price growth begins traditionally after summer silence, and it may become more sensitive in the autumn.
The target of consumer inflation in Russia is 7,5 per cent, most likely, as the RF has financial accumulation.
Garden centres are regretted by reducing the number of householders
Such a decline due to an exceptional reduction in the number of householders less than 35 years of age may lead to the loss of tens of million pounds per year, when today's young consumers have reached the “basic age of garden”, according to the HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, people who take off their housing spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that owners of their homes spend on gardening.
It refers to the increase in the number of people living in high-urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of the asfalting of courts in front of the parking house and the reduction of garden size as other factors threatening the industry, the annual sale of which is estimated to be $5 billion.
In Great London, where the number of householders dropped from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the lowest in Britain waste for gardeners for household.
HTA and the Royal Garden Society reported that the rental of housing and the lack of space for the garden did not mean that humans could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, Chief Garden Adviser in RHS, said: "The growing of plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular for renters who can carry plants with them when they move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as “the Golden Age” of trade in garden goods as a result of an increase in the number of householders and economic prosperity from the end of the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also envisages that the market will improve this year because of better weather after the disadvantaged conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria conducted mass cleaning in the Agriculture Fund
Three of the four heads of the Agriculture Fund were replaced on Friday.
In general, three of the four heads of the Agriculture Fund were replaced on Friday.
The official Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria reported only the elimination of the position of Executive Director Atanas Dobrov.
His place was Lozan Vasilev.
It turns out that two of the three Executive Directors of the Fund had changed quietly on Friday.
The Deputy Executive Director Tatian Angelov, who has been responsible for State aid and the SAPARD programme, informed BGNES with reference to the Traud newspaper.
I didn't attend the Board of Heads of the Fund because we were not, by law, members of the leadership, but I was told later that I was released.
I can't tell why my release is not reported on the Fund's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope I will know more on Monday," she said to Angelova.
It will be taken by Ivanka Bagdatova, who was still head of the Investment Loan in the Central Agriculture Fund in Sofia.

Turkey calls for an American diplomat in connection with the spies report
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey called for the highest American diplomat in the country to clarify the report on American and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bullent reported that the US trusted in cases and the Turkish officials discussed a message on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Intercept Internet journal reported that documents provided by the former US National Security Agency Edward Snowden showed that Turkey was a priority intelligence for American and British Intelligence Services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reduced the importance of this communication, saying that all leading countries were spying each other.
The previous report on the fact that the main intelligence agency of Germany has also made Ankara an intelligence facility has raised a more angry response from the Turkish Government.
The largest Chinese companies have joined against Alibaba
Chinese companies, among whom the largest girl in China of commercial real estate, Dalian Wanda Group and Internet Giants Tencent Holdings (sociates, messengers, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engineer), are creating a company that will compete on the online trade market with Alibaba.
However, the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which even left the American rivals -- eBay and Amazon.com, will be difficult.
The Greatest Union
Companies plan to invest 5 billion juanas ($814 million), 70 per cent will belong to Wanda and 15 per cent, each of the Internet companies, says Wanda Group.
The company is planned to be registered in Hong Kong.
The SP will combine Baidu's search services with the popular weChat social platform (the largest social network in China, whose number of users is about 438 million), the Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 feschebel hotels, the Wanda group runs at least 49 commercial real estate facilities throughout China and 40 trade centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion Yuanas ($8 billion) in the construction of the movies and thematic entertainment park in Cindao (East of China in the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and to make $960 million profits.
Furthermore, Wanda belongs to the American AMC Entertainment Holdings movie network, which makes the company the biggest cinema operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its trading centres, hotels and places of entertainment with e-commerce, whose development will be carried out by the Alibaba competitive.
According to Dun Cé, who will head the new company, Wanda will be able to increase its e-commerce users from the current 40 million to 100 million by the next year.
The new place should become the largest online-to-offline platform in the world, noted Dun Cé.
The point of online-to-offline (O2O) of the commercial is to attract customers on the Internet to come to ordinary offline stores or to buy other traditional services.
The classical example of O2O is coupon selling services such as Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the biggest " pie" in the online trade," said Wanda Van Jeanlin (Bloomberg).
"Now, there is no O2O area in China, and in this situation, the chances of everyone are approximately equal," he said.
The Chinese Internet Trade Market is the biggest in the world, and, according to McKinsey & Co., it will increase more than three times by 2015, compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese internet users increased to 632 million, Bloomberg reported official statistics: it is more of the population of any country of the world, except India.
And according to forecasts, by 2015, this number could grow to 850 million people.
The Wealthiest Union
The Chief of Tencent Ma Huaten has recently been the richest man in China, but according to the Bloomberg Millioners Index, the founder of Alibaba Jack Ma has already been a $5.5 billion.
The status of Jack Ma is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion will come to his share in Alibaba.
The leader of Baidu Robin Lee is currently third among the richest people of China, while Van Zyanglin of Wanda is the fourth track of the rating.
"In this battle, it is very interesting to observe: three of the richest people are combining efforts to challenge even more wealthy," said the chief of the Chinese Centre for Electronic Trade Study in Hangjou Cao Lei.
But he believes that the new company would hardly be able to compete with Alibaba immediately after the creation of Rome, "The Rome cannot be built in one day."
The fact that Alibaba was not just competitive with new companies, but also with the earned world Internet trade leaders, the report on Alibaba's financial indicators for the last quarter indicated before.
Alibaba is often described as something medium between eBay and Amazon.com, but since April and June, the Chinese company earned more than both its American competitors together.
The net profits of Alibaba over the period almost twice exceeded the same summary of competitors -- it grew almost three times in the annual calculation and amounted to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has a huge capacity to generate money, much thanks to its mobile applications," Bloomberg commented on the report of an analyst from the Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to the updated Alibaba Prospectus on the U.S. Pricing Papers and Markets Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company was 188 million in July, which significantly exceeded the March rate (163 million).
32.8% of all Alibaba transactions for the past quarter had to be carried on mobile devices.
Alibaba is to call for the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to the average assessment of 11 Bloomberg analysts, the company could be estimated at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to the sources of Bloomberg, the Alibaba debut on the New York Fundamental Market (NYSE) could be held on 16 September.
Road-show companies previously launched on 3 September.
It is expected that Alibaba's IPO exit will be recorded in NYSE history and will allow the company to attract about $20 billion.
To date, the record of funds in the United States markets belonged to Visa Payment System, which had originally placed its shares in 2008, earning $7.9 billion.
At least half of the food goods in the trading networks should be Russian production, the Deputies of the State are considered.
They have developed a bill on that subject.
It is about amendments to section 8 of the FS “Of the grounds for public trade management in RF” and the Tax Code.
The aim of the document is to introduce protection measures for Russian food producers.
The important clarifyment, according to the draft law, should be at least 50 per cent of domestic production products in shops at all types of goods.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, for example, vegetables and winter fruits, so it will be made for them to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also modifies the RF Tax Code, which sets a lower rate of 10 per cent in the implementation of all foodstuffs, whose country of origin is Russia, reports the report " Notifications " .
On 27 August, a draft law on amendments to the FZ " About Distribution Markets " was introduced to the House of Parliament, which suggests that agricultural markets in Russia be restored to which small producers can implement their products.
The Chief of the Police of Magalufa has been accused of corruption
The plaintiffs presented evidence of the expulsion by the police and officials of the Calvia municipality to the Office of the Prosecutor of the State of Maljorka on Friday.
The Chief of the Calvia Police on the Maljorka Court Island was arrested as a result of the charges of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the scandally known centre of the unconstable drinking of Magalufa.
The Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was detained as a result of the charges of corruption against him by several businessmen with Punta Ballen, the street with most bars and night clubs of Magalufa.
According to the daily online publication of Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of expulsion by the police and officials of the Calvia municipality to the Office of Prosecutor Maljorka to combat corruption on Friday.
Two other local policemen were arrested by the Guardians of the National Guard of Spain for the charges of corruption and will be interrogated by the judge with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that dissatisfied owners of night clubs said that protectionism by the authorities had a serious impact on their business.
"The word is no longer to earn money, it is to survive," said one businessman.
We can't endanger our sources of existence.
We don't have anything to lose.
Magaluf was in the titles of the international press this summer after a popular video on YouTube, showing an 18-year-old British vacation vacationer who was taking 24 men during the bar race.
The authorities of the island have since been trying to cease huliganism among the rest of Magaluph, minimizing the number of scandal-known alcohol races on bars.
Furthermore, the Playhouse Club, where a mine accident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and the Carnage Racing Facility were jointly punished for €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist place of Magaluf, primarily popular among young British vacationers, was also a place of numerous accidents in the state of alcoholic drinking associated with a crazy party known as "balconing" when people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring has been marked with wet and wind conditions affecting flights at the Adelaide Airport
The spring prepared a cold surprise in Southern Australia, rainfalls and strong winds that affected flights at the Adelaid Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city at 9:00 a.m., after 6.6 mm, which fell in the night of Sunday.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short limbs with a broken wind, including a storm that began shortly before 8 a.m. and poured nearly 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter released the early spring last week, the temperature fell again on Monday until only 15.8C in the city.
The qualified conditions are expected to have served one of the reasons for delaying the flight of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaid.
The plane had to land immediately after 7:30 p.m., but it had gotten into the wind-shift zone -- sudden speed change or direction of the wind at a short distance -- and was forced to acquire a height.
The wind strikes reached 50 km/h on the ground at the Adelaid Airport at that time.
The flights showed that the plane had to elevate during the second landing, and the plane eventually landed around 8:40 at night.
The delay of this flight resulted in a subsequent delay in several other flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
Maximum 16C is foreseen in Adelaide on Tuesday with the probability of one or two liquors.
Establishment of building facilities in RF will take place in a new manner
Price education, construction management, and network connection issues of the Federal Anti-Monopolity Service take special control.
FAS was established by an expert competitive Council in construction.
At its meeting, the Chief of the Management of the JICK, construction and natural resources of FAS Vadem Solovjev stated that " today's calculation of construction facility estimates is absolutely unacceptable".
The normal base makes price education untransparent and may lead to an unreasonable price of construction, they believe in FAS.
It is also suggested that the cost of the construction of public facilities at the stage of designing to determine, on the basis of the market prices of constructive decisions, instead of the estimated standards applied today and the individual assessments on technological operations.
These proposals are submitted to the road map and are now reviewed in the minstro.
"The replacement of traditional accounting documentation in the construction of constructive elements must lead to less corruption in the sector," explained the RGB, Vadim Soloviev.
Because the waste is calculated now, and it is not always possible to verify everything, so sometimes in the documentation, the unfavourable construction companies can bury "all tractors".
The FAS minstrome agrees.
“The first work on the cost of constructive elements has already been made: constructive decisions, estimates on these indicators have been developed,” said the Chief of the Department of Graduation and Ministerial Architecture of Elena Žukova.
As a pilot, the road construction area is selected.
However, experts believe that the problem was much more serious.
As said by the Chief of the Profi Invest Building Company, Anatoli Demianko, the estimated standards have long expired, but the other business mechanism has not yet been proposed.
"As for the proposed calculations on constructive elements, it is practically difficult to realize this, since the construction of buildings is often used in totally different technologies," he said.
It's not a secret that the structure is developing much through the state order.
According to the chairman of the NP, the " Expert Community of Professional Professionals" of Ekatherina Lezina, today the State is the most payable contractor.
The Deputy Director for Industrial Capital Building Centre Rosatom Vladimir Malahov noted that the market today is conditionally divided into companies with access to the contract portfolio and to companies owning monopoly competences and not allowing competitives to do so.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is maximumly constrained from a managing impact.
The expert council was invited to establish a system of orders in a way that the same executor was not entitled to receive more than one contract at a sum of over 1 billion or a number of contracts of over 1 billion rubs.
The minister believes that this approach should be evaluated in terms of business impact and the efficiency of construction management.
As Elena Žukova explained, it would be necessary to provide the contractor with the functions of the gender contractor, which would increase the number of procurement and budget costs for its content.
Contracting experts will, however, be required to have knowledge that will evaluate the quality of the work carried out by the subregional organizations as well as their safety.
It will often be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the security of the facility as a whole.
Furthermore, this approach could result in the rate of highly qualified procurement participants because of the uninterestingness of a public order for part-time work and a small amount of contract.
The Heads of the Institute for Procurement of Expert and Consultation Institute, Alexander Eustaschenkov, believes that the State Procedure has now become a business game for the contractor's attention.
The example was: "Completementary indicators" should be indicated without the words "or equivalent", "must be", "of", "more", " less", " less", "analog", "or", "like type", "no" below, "no" above, "more", "may be", "may be", "example", "not above", "not above", "no" and "no more" and so on.
Thus, customers often abuse their right to establish the requirements for the substantial organisations ' request.
Another 44-FZ issue, in the opinion of Eustaschenkov, needed to evaluate the quality of the application through the " paper " proposal of the participant.
In considering the application of the participant, the qualifications of the contractor can be assessed but not the quality of the work that have not yet been performed, the expert believes.
Quality of work can be evaluated only when they are received.
The Expert Board also proposed that marginal income from top to lower echelon be transferred to the end of the intermediate contractors.
The Chairman of the Expert Council, the Secretary-General, FAS FAC FAC, Andrej Carikovski believes that this should not be done, since the contractor should be responsible.
Otherwise, how is Arcadius Reikin "Athele," "There's a claim to the buttons?".
Israeli children return to school after war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories next to the Gaza Strip again went to school on Monday after they spent summer in bomb shelters, when rockets and mines dropped into their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed during the reconstruction of the territories.
The beginning of school classes brought joy and anxiety to those affected by missiles in the southern Israeli settlements, but the signs of battle remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the Children's Garden of Pashosh, in which the missile was arrived, removed the traces of the stains and the children's mountains before the disciples came.
"We are a little afraid, but we are happy to look into the future," said Ronith Bart, a resident of Kibuza Saad and an English teacher in his school.
Many children in our area really need to come back to a great life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that suddenly, she would start going to school "a little weird."
"It was a difficult time, and we were not leaving our houses at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibuz, near the Gaza border, to express his support.
Before the ceasefire agreement stopped the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements, such as Saad, did not leave their homes or leave their homes, left safe areas far from the Gaza Strip to save from missile and minometers.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, near the Gaza border, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a district of the Palestinian mine, doubted that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families still haven't returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for this time.
Prime Minister Benyamin Netanjahu visited the school in Sderota, a city on the border of Gaza, which has been very much striving from the Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to learn thoroughly, and said, "We will do what we can to give you knowledge and to ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an immediate reconciliation last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately put an end to the fight, but the key issues remained unsolved, for example, the Hamas requirement for the withdrawal of the Egyptian Israeli Gaza Block and the opening of airports and maritime ports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to put his weapons and restore the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
The new stage of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2100 Palestinians, including three quarters were peaceful citizens, and at least 494 children, estimated by the Palestinian and the UN.
Israel contests these figures and claims that at least half of the men were killed by warriors; however, it did not provide substantial evidence that confirmed that allegation.
66 soldiers and six peaceful inhabitants, including one Thai worker, were killed by Israel.
During the fight, Hamas and other Gaza warriors released 4591 rockets and mines on Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, conducted more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of houses in Gaza were damaged and destroyed, and 250,000 were estimated to have found asylum in more than 100 schools that were converted into shelters.
Because tens of thousands were still in shelters and the fights continued, the educational officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon be opened to enable us to complete our education as the children of the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of the Gaza schools.
According to the popular criteria, real estate prices showed the largest winter growth in seven years.
The cost of RP Data Corelogic Hedonic housing index for housing prices in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August, reported on Monday.
This increase led to a total increase in June, July and August by 4.2 per cent, the largest increase in winter since 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, more than double increases for 12 months by August 2013, but the increase was not equally allocated to the country.
The Director of RP Data Tim Loules reported that Sydney and Melbourne were conducting a two-level market.
The RP Data digits show that the Sydney housing prices increased by 16.1 per cent in the last year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent.
The following markets were Adelaida, Brisbain and Darwin, where the prices were on average from five to six per cent.
The other end of the scale was the Canberra, which took place by government reductions, where prices were only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Loules said that now that the spring began, there would be an increase in the number of property objects available for sale during several months, which would be a " real test" for the market.
"In view of the current high sales rate, the overall sales rate and current conditions with a low percentage rate, the housing would likely grow in the next three months," he said.
How people live in the oldest house of Ufa
In the former house of gold industry and miningers, Eudokim and his son, Ivan Demidov, on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (ex Great Casanese) 18 apartments.
The home of the 18th century has almost changed from the time of construction, unless the highness is counted.
Foreign people go here as a trip, and residents suffer more than rejoice, from their privilege to live in the older Ufim house, whose walls are remembered by Chief Alexandr Suvorov.
The building date of the house is incorrect, the historians indicate two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, the building is unleashed of 300 years.
Old court, always open door, screaming stairs.
The doors of the apartment are close to each other, the walls shook, and the street is seen in the brightness of the scratch.
It looks like it's all true.
And the locals say, "You don't think it is."
Living in a wooden house of the 18th century, explained Tatiana Lucianova, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is on the disposal, but the money for its content has not been given for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities have simply forgotten.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still poor, but the foundation's all rotten.
Many inhabitants are still going to the bathroom on the street, and they are washed once a week in a public bathroom.
How can we be satisfied in such conditions?
The road goes right under the windows, not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatiana's pulling off the curtain.
Now you can see that it was all heard before: car flows under the windows.
You see, the glass keep dripping, we can't open the windows, but we're used to the noise.
A man is used to all things, to good and bad.
Our apartment is still model, thank your husband, his hands are golden.
In addition, we have two rooms, we live three with our son.
Other families have a lot worse condition, and the second floor is at least about a half altitude of the roof.
For the contrast, Tatiana suggests a visit to a neighbour from apartment No. 6 of the Lumile Starship.
A nice hospitable woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and, with a sad smile, says:
We have a one-room apartment, 14,5 m2 per four people, so we live: my husband and my grandchildren.
I've been here since I've been born, and there's never been another housing area, and Lumila's been surrounding the room with the eyes: anthresoles, two couches of "g" and one of them had a grandchildren with a laptop.
Very tight and little different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "history".
But from the ceiling is regularly flowing: the water system is nowhere.
Lumila speaks about her apartment in a normal and amazing way, like a Italian woman whose house is on the Roman ruins.
So it brings into a very old and recent, daily and legendary:
The water was spent about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a small kitchen in the corner and the toilet from the former sandwich.
We live just where Demides and the family were living, and the servants lived on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, and why?
The Centre for real estate says Privatization has no significance.
We'll only get a one-room apartment, but we can't pretend for more.
For four months ago, we were promised to be displaced, but the promises were not further.
I'm not used to complaining or I won't.
In this apartment (room!) there was a whole dynasty: my grandmother and grandpa, my mom and Dad, I and my husband and my daughter with my granddaughter.
It's been all the time.
For example, good rats were running through the kitchen.
Look at the flygel walls, they're meter fat!
They say the solution was involved in eggs, so it's been holding so long.
It's a good house, thanks to the Demids!
It's probably the only reason that it's killing no one in the boat or his own.
Only the building is slowly dying in our eyes: the boards and the breeds of the house rot, the floors have failed repeatedly, we filled with cement, but all useless - solution goes into the ground like a well.
They say we're under our room with a secret hole and a journey to the White River, which was specially made by old believers here once, so that they could hide from danger, if anything.
They were persecuted.
Ludmila Starostina tells us how a historian came to them, begging for him to start an excavation apartment.
And then he convinced them to give them a shelter in exchange for his one in October's prospectus.
Lumila refused the historian:
Where are we four to one?
And here there's a little hope that they'll make the housing more space.
If we agreed on the exchange, we wouldn't win anything anymore.
However, the Older's family won nothing.
The greatest dream of Ludmila was to be displaced, and the 16 - year - old daughter gave a separate room.
That is, two families have allocated a two-room apartment instead of the most magnificent ruins in which two generations live now.
A nice, miniature girl, Olesia Karsakova, from apartments No. 11 and 12, shows the second floor of the house.
There are two tight rooms of 23 m2, named by the apartments, a large family.
Seven of us, two children.
You can see the conditions.
It is derived from pieces, as well as window frames, walls in the kitchen and in the rooms of cross holes.
The water in the crown is only cold for a year.
By walking through the apartments of the oldest house of Ufa, you can be sure that most of all have been lucky for the Lawrence's spouses from apartment No. 4.
They take the most spacious rooms of the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of rooms!
Accommodation 75 squares, three people are prescribed.
We live just in the rooms where, by legend, Suvorov stayed during his residence in Uf,” said Alexander Dmitrijevic Lavrentiev, head of the family.
The ceilings are high, space.
One bad thing, everything's smashed around, it's falling, it's falling.
The neighbors must have already told!
Most of the torture we have with sexes: wooden boards are rotten, the earth literally went out of the feet.
I put backups, blankets; there's nothing else in the hall, and we're walking in the other room like we're screwing up on the cockroaches, and everything's so screwed up.
The house of Eudokim Demidov Alexander Dmitrijevic could tell better about any excursion guide.
The gold industry is treated as a family, speaking of him with delight.
Indeed, the identity was urgent: the Master of Kagin and Uzian factories built houses, poured guns and bells, held ural mines.
Shopping real estate is proud of the ancestors, but they don't want to live under one roof with history anymore.
I have settled here as a child, in the 40s of the 20th century,” said Alexander Dmitrijevic.
The wooden carriage rooms, stables, and caraulic boxes were then stopped.
In 1968 they wanted to clean up our house, but something stopped...
History has been repeated in 2014: new housing has been redeployed.
We, as a team, collected all documents, covered the necessary instances, and suddenly learned that the move to the apartment is transferred for 2015 or 2016.
There's something we don't believe in...
Two years ago, Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bascortostan to find out about the fate of the house.
Housing officials didn't accept.
They were sent from one table to another and then, as a laugh, issued a paper without signing and printing, "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the settlement of residents."
I have a feeling that our house has been out of town for a long time, since it was first number 57, then became 57 A, and now 57/1.
It's like it's been destroyed in the '70s.
The Russian Planet addressed the headquarters of the information and analytical management sector for land resources of Ufa Vladimir Barabas.
The house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the programme of resettlement of large housing.
I can't be responsible for the work of officials in the '70s, but I know that there was a plan for all old houses, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities was to restore all old houses on the street of the October Revolution, representing architecture value, was successfully implemented.
The inhabitants are planned to settle in new apartments soon.
According to Barabas, the home of Demidov will be restored by Italian specialists who participated in the restaurant of buildings in Venice.
There is now an architecture biennale in Italy, and the Old Ufa project is presented there among others.
Hopefully, by 2016, the entire old Casanese Street will be restored,” says the official.
The house will be acquired by the appropriate species that was before three centuries ago.
The home of Demidov will probably be a museum opened to all those who wish.
In addition, at the Government level, the street was decided to be made walking on weekends.
Unfortunately, it will not be possible in the day of the city's excessive loading of roads.
Deployment of people from the future museum, Vladimir Barabas, promised in 2015.
However, they may not remain pleased: their new apartments will be the same area as the present.
Only from another age.
A forest fire began in the Primorje due to the storm
The dry storm was caused by a forest fire in the Territory of the Hunting Forestry in the Fire Area of the Sealand.
There is a growing grouping of forces and funds.
According to the Guide of the CCSCB “Sea Aviation Base”, the conditions established in the fireplace require the attraction of air forces.
Vasilij Medvedev, Deputy Chief of Aviabasa:
The fire in a difficult area was discovered by an observer from the board of an An-2 patrol aircraft on a 3 hectares area.
The wood remains are burning on the old burner.
The severe degradation of the territories and the slope of more than 45 degrees, the absence of fire discharges creates significant difficulties in the surveillance.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
The delivery of forces available to the airbassian helicopter M-2 and An-2 is very difficult.
After the fire was detected, four firefighters were immediately deployed.
The main challenge of professionals is to gas fire and to prepare a field for additional forces and means of fire.
In the area of lunch, three firefighters are additionally delivered to the village of Hunting Helicopter.
As soon as the helicopter lands in the fire area is ready, professionals will be transferred to the site of surveillance, reports on the site of the Administration of the Primorian Land.
My father never hugged me.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of the seven children born in the family of immigrants from Jamaica to Dudley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in the factory, and their relationships were limited.
Henry practices the comedie, "Raded Rudy plates", which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and has grown from a series of transmissions to Radio 4.
Saundtreck is a mixture of reggs and rap, and the melodies are joyful.
However, Henry had to get through some difficult memories of his childhood.
After his mother's death, there was a "mnogy" treatment, and Henry often thinks about relations with his father.
He was very unavailable.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice, "Don't noise.
Get away from your sister.
Move!
I want to watch the cricket.
My senior brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, walked with him to the pub and talked about things like the form of a beer glass, the beauty of the cricket.
I've never spoken to him like that.
He was such a smileless guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Henry recently opened the Lithuanian workshop in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than the days of his father, he could see what his life must have been.
It's a little better now, but it's dark, smoke, depths of the labyrinths with flashing of fire and smoke and a dog of sage.
My father climbed into the bathroom and just lied there, and you heard him starting to sing for himself because he wanted to wash out of the lithium workshop.
When I got there, I realized that he was doing this for years and years to make money for us, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry was out of childhood deprived of parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom got sick at the end of her life, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don Franch, allowed him to share the love he lacked in his childhood.
Can you stop "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don Franch.
Why don't I get friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with Franch, whom he was married for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
The mother Henry himself had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I'm very, very well, and I have symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take radical measures.
At that time, I started serious exercises with fittens, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And it's boring.
No one eats carrots.
The change in Henry's career trajectory may be reflected in his noble, shortly shaved beard.
Since he received the criticism of his Othello, he was totally flying into the theater.
Followed the "Commedy of Errors" and then "Grades" of August Wilson.
This work is different from sitcoms and comedies, which were the inalienable attribute of its saturated professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ noticed he paroded on the stage and wrote about it in the New Face.
His television career began in the mid-sevenths, "I've been the only black parodist/comic on television for a long time."
He was at work.
I didn't only have to grow in front of the public, but I had to learn to be an effective ridiculous car between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on TV, and that was very difficult.
Lenny in New Persons in 1975
Since his manager had the right to "Black and White Arrows Show", the light fun program in which people "searched their face", Henry discovered that he was speaking in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I think I wish that never happened to me, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange, condemned position, I worked on large places and learned to work with a crowd.
But what was "the reward of the easy entertainment classic on British TV years and years" was also "grotesk parodya for black people".
Representing characters that have also been abusing the culture of black people in Britain and singing it, Henry worked in an alternative comedian project in the 1980s.
The first season of Lenny Henry was broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as, among other things, the chef of Garret Blacklock from the Chef Comedy Series.
The advertising films, documentary films, televisions and movies took the next ten years of his life, but after his BBC series in 2008 LennyHenry.tv, he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems like you're pulling time or turning a little bit away."
There was a series of documentary transmissions to Radio 4 entitled "What's good in...?"
The first one was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy to Shakespeare.
You can't tell me that I was taught at school, and I thought it was, in many ways, a prerogative of white people in the middle class with cowboys and cowboys at the bottom of the front.
So I was really afraid of him.
Everyone who was interviewed, Peter Hall, Trevor Nan, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You have to try.
Don't blame it until you know what you're talking about.
Speak up some of these words, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from the last monolog Otello for documentary transfer, and he was trapped.
I feel like I can do this.
It's like I got my head fixed.
"What it is, it is a serious matter, seriously, learn your text, conduct a little study.
So the process of exercise was hard, and I read this play months and months before we put it in.
And she was successful.
They seemed to be waiting for the disaster, and it didn't happen.
Soon we started the Miscellaneous Commedia.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical disorder, and Henry felt instinctively that his case was to entertain the audience.
"The voice inside me said, "You have to work 10 minutes until they make a computer."
Instead, the assistant of the director announced that the presentation would be resumed as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the scene and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my duty.
I can let someone else handle this.
"You're playing a play, stay in the role."
Henry in the "Plays" at the Daches Theatre
It was difficult to learn the text for "Offences".
The panic is pretty useful, it strengthens the muscle.
She was also taken well, so it was like a sign above, showing, "This is what you need to do."
He said that, of course, by the voice of the grave.
So I'm holding this.
I really love that.
I like being in the rehearsal.
By the way, Henry still has a comic thinking -- the whole road of our conversation is going through the flash of his humor when he starts, it ends with paroding.
I just decided not to work in the stenda, because this thing with the immediate remuneration from the full room of strangers, I think it's pretty dangerous.
If you're trying to do this all the time, it might be a trap.
I work at "Prame Eter in Apollo whenever I want, but mostly, I don't get the same pleasure as before.
I'm asking if he's ever going to run a stendap tour.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps to give up the form of the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I ever want to give up.
So that's his new formation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a nice party.
You always tell a story, and there's a great place for it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers public officials to identify "invisible workers"
Kenya began the biometrical registration of all government officials in attempting to remove " invisible workers" from the Government's paying statement.
The Government's statement reports that staff who are not registered for the next two weeks will no longer be paid.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive wages after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyath promised to reduce corruption in public structures after the government came to power in 2013.
The audit review earlier this year revealed that at least a million (70,000 £) per month was lost by payments to “invisible workers” and other financial violations.
The Government suspects that wages continue to apply to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves a public service, reports BBC reporter Vanyam Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All public officials should appear in the identification centres for the next two weeks in order to ensure that their data will be collected through the biometric registration procedure, the Government statement is reported.
Anyone who does not do this without respect will be deleted from the payment statement, it is reported.
"This procedure will significantly facilitate the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public officials, and will also be used to clean up the payment statement at both levels of the Government, thus put an end to the problem of " invisible workers", said Anne Weiguru, the Secretary of the Ministry of Planning and Structure.
Dozens of Turkish police have been arrested for " conspiracy" against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of the “government against the Government”, reported local information agencies.
The police have not immediately commented on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-level officers, reports Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them participated in determining corruption activities last December, which were aimed at verifying Government staff, including four Government ministers.
Several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of organized criminal grouping and telephone audition in July.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (which was then Prime Minister) identified their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others standing at the authorities, the Islamic Cliric Fethullah Gullen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a great event for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
He said to the anticipated journalists that not all schools were opened again, but that he would do the best to protect the country for future generations:
The first September ceremony was not in every school.
There is no peaceful sky over each part of Ukraine.
We must fight for the peaceful heavens.
All Ukraine, a huge one Ukrainian people's front, should fight for the peaceful sky.
Alexan Pastuchov, director of the school in Slovenia, where the daughter of Yacenuka went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future life.
The first day of training is traditionally marked by children wearing shirts, holding airballs in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Ronna Fairhead BBC, she may have found such an impressive leader she needs.
It follows the glory of the banking, media management and internal circles of the Tori Party.
In fact, she has her own experience in management positions.
Her career began in the consulting company on the global Bain and Co management, and then continued in Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world in Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, retiring when the high post in Pearson's headquarters took a man who was a less low-posted colleague.
Its earnings are said to be nearing a million pounds.
Its political rating is also strong.
It was recommended to David Cameron, Lord Brown, former head of BP, when he tried to bring specialists from the private sector to Whitehall: she became a ministerial adviser.
Her husband was Tori's former advisor.
Earlier in May, I called the chairman of a poisoned cup.
BBC is not only an enormous and complicated organization in the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two dimensions: the upper level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but also the voice of public concern and anxiety when something goes wrong.
It is almost unattainable duelia, which requires full radical reform.
However, what new chairman would risk coming, crushing and destructing the Institute as complex as the Chinese dynasty if he had lost his own work in the process.
It's a hard decision.
It would not be so difficult, many people would be pleased to see the BBC cut down in size, after revising its powers, finances and status.
As competitors collapse the circle and new technologies challenge the comfortable old habits, inevitable negotiations on the value of the licence pose a special danger to BBC.
For a modest amount of $145,50 per year, the British acquire a share in the most largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it states that the results of its work cover 96 per cent of households and are only 40p per day.
Furthermore, Beeb's popularity is increasing: 53 per cent have been supported today against 31 per cent of 10 years ago.
The BBC view and use models have changed: I now receive news headlines on my mobile phone and watch the missed iPlayer programs.
But it remains a very popular and exciting agency.
He needs an impressive chairman. I hope he's found him.
Perry from Texas says that a humiliating tweet was written by someone stranger.
Twitter from the confirmed account of Governor Texas, Republican Rick Perry, on Sunday night, contained an insulting picture of the District Prosecutor from Democrats, which is at the centre of the criminal prosecution for abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed and followed by another Perry account in which the record was desaved.
I just posted a tweet from my account, which was written by someone stranger.
"I do not approve this tweet, and I removed it," reports a later record.
Perry's assistants did not immediately respond to their request to comment.
Although the records were loaded from the Perry's confirmed account, it was not clear who actually was publishing the tape.
The early tweet contained an unpleasant cartoon for the prosecutor of the District Travis Rosemery Lemberg, who recognized guilty of driving in the state of alcohol in April 2013.
Perry prohibited the financing of her agency when she refused to resign, which led to the trial of a great jury in Austin in this month against Perry, which was a potential candidate for presidents at the 2016 elections.
The signature in yours says, "I don't always drive a drinking car three times above the acceptable level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do it, I'm accusing Governor Perry for telling me that."
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
Lemberg's headquarters did not investigate a major jury against Perry.
Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Anthonyo, who was appointed the Republican judge.
Perry did not recognize himself guilty and called the charges a political trick.
His powerful legal team asked the judge to reject the accusation act by saying that the law used to persecute the governor who fulfils his responsibilities longer than all of the history of Texas would distinguish that contrary to the constitution.
Perry stopped funding for $7.5 million from the State Public Oversight Division, which is based in Travis County and pursues corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to resign.
Veto filed an official complaint by the public control team with the left views.
Perry's confirmed account is often updated and sometimes becomes famous.
When Perry arrived at the fifth party in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, he replied to the rumors that he could get out of the game by publishing a tweet with a photo of himself running next to the lake and saying, "Here we, South Caroline!"
Berkeley reported that the real estate market returned to "normal"
One of London's most famous builders warned that the real estate market in south-eastern England has "returned" to the normal level of activity.
The capital's house was subject to a vivid demand and rapidly increasing prices, and the fear that the credit bubble would undermine the Bank of England to set limits to mortgage loans in June was widely widespread.
Tony Pidgeli, founder and chairman of the Berkeley elite construction company, said on Monday: " Since the start of the financial year, the market returned to a normal level of transactions from the year 2013," adding that it provided a "stable working environment".
The London real estate market was successful during decline, since foreign buyers moved to the capital.
The prices in the city increased by 18.5 per cent for only one last year, according to the Earth’s Inventory, significantly increased by the average rate of 6.7 per cent in England and Wales as a whole.
The average market prices on private, accessible and student schemes of Berkeley grew about one fifth last year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London's real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of which also stopped the introduction of new taxes on real estate and political rhetoric around the potential "payment tax" before the universal elections in May next.
The London estate agency of Foxtons last week warned that the April Reform of the Mortgage Market, under which more strict conditions for loan were introduced, would also reduce market growth both the sales deal and prices in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from the Bank of England showed the decrease in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, assuming further cooling on the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, reduced its price growth forecast for the London real estate for 2015 to 3 per cent, based on the fact that real estate prices have already been weakened.
The volumes of transactions, meanwhile, have fallen a quarter compared to the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfer and Kensington, on WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the demand for homes in the capital was very favourable for Berkeley, as the sales amounted to $2.2 billion.
Mr. Piggley added: "The demand for good design and better location remains old and, reflecting that, sales have been saved for a period of time."
In June, the company reported that it sold 3742 new homes in this year until the end of April, almost a third of more than in the docrisic peak of 2007.
The annual tax payment income increased by 40 per cent compared to the previous year to $380 million, the income of 18 per cent to $1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Pigley reported that the estimated revenues of Berkeley for this year would be in line with the current market expectations.
According to analysts, profits are expected for a year before taxes are paid in $450 million.
The value of Berkeley shares was held on 23.96 pounds on the london market on the second half of the day.
Naked Jennifer Lawrence photos are published online by the hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrived at the 85th ceremony of the annual prize of the American Academy.
The photos of the naked actress, Jennifer Lawrence, who received the Oscar prize, were presented on the Internet by a hacker who assures that she has a catalogue of 100 other stars upwards.
The representative of the star of Hungry Games confirmed that Lawrence's photographs were present, and condemned the hacker for "a sudden invasion in personal space".
The law enforcement authorities have been approached, and they will persecute anyone who will publish the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
Photos that were originally presented on the 4chan photo exchange website were allegedly received because of the lack of Apple iCloud's online storage system, and the alleged " catalogue" of victims includes the names of dozens of women, including Rianna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsteed and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
I don't know how many of these photos are true, although the Scott Pillygrima star against everyone, Winstead also condemned the invasion in Twitter.
"The one who watches the photos we made with my husband a few years ago when we were alone at home -- I hope you're proud of yourself," Winstead wrote in Twitter.
However, Victoria Justis, from Nicolodeon "iCarly" and "Victory Victory" denied that she wrote in Twitter, "This is the so-called photos of the naked me FALSHIVEK, people.
Let me stop it in the fertilizer.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that the pop star representative of Ariana Grande objected to the fact that the photos on which it was supposed to be true.
Exclusive passage from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and letter "J", which caused criticism
They've been dissolving, best to say that, they've gradually fallen like a card box that they've left under the rain.
Only sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, difficult in association, tense, closed and perhaps a little irritating.
And then she squeezed his hand.
He saw his irritation.
He was like a barrel, yes.
The last victim of this collapse was a small romance that he expected more than usual, exemption from lonely and boring life, and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a sharply fragile beauty with a whispered hair and a heartbreaking from the northern island village, even more remote and cruel than Port Royben.
She arrived south with a satellite older of herself, which Kevern considered her aunt, and the last she had inherited a house in a raw, but a paradise of the valley called "Raven Valley".
No one lived in the house for years.
The tubes flowed, the spiders were sitting in the baths, the slips left their traces on all windows confident that the house belongs to them; the garden rose like giant cabbages.
It was like a child's book cabin, scary and charming, with a full secret garden.
The author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was included in the Dutch Booker Prize in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week
Kevern and Eileen were sitting, holding hands in broken shezlongs among high grass, enjoying suddenly a warm spring day; both of them connected to a cheap console that supplied the country with a peaceful music and calming news when he looked at her crossed brown legs, he remembered the old song of a long-forgotten black performer who loved to listen to his father, dropped the curtains in the house.
You have too big legs.
In view of their aggression, such songs have no longer been lost on the console.
They were not forbidden, nothing was forbidden, but they were no longer lost.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word "archaic".
Public taste was done by what would never be achieved by orders and regulations, and just as people chose memoars of rich people who grew up in poverty, culinary books and love novels, they chose ballades from all the music.
In the excitement of this day, Kevern began to play the imaginary piano and a rough comic voice to sing Aileen's big legs.
Eileen didn't understand.
"It was a popular jazz pianist, named Fates Waller," he said to her, attaching two fingers to her lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before he gets off his lips.
This started with the game they played when he was a kid.
His father played with her with his father, as he told him.
Start the word with "J", forget to put two fingers on your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew he was expecting it, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen never heard of him.
Neither did Jazz play, even though he was not openly prohibited.
Improvization is out of fashion.
There's only one "if" place in life.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's just the same thing with a embarrassment.
His unpredictableness affected people.
And the jazz was a sharpness expressed by music.
Although he was 10 years old and never heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew about the jazz from the father's half-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fates Waller was black.
Given her age, she had hardly remembered the time when the popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressures.
The society was obedient, which meant that each of its segments agreed with gratitude - thanks to those who were preserved by fate - with the principle of grouping.
The people of the Afro-Caribian origin of temperament and physical characteristics were good for the field of entertainment and sport - and they sang and run.
Indostaters, as if they were talented from nature in everything that was concerned with electronics, had taken care that no family would be left without a working electronic phone.
What remained from the Polish diaspora was a san technical work; what remained from Greek was a plate.
Exiters from the Persian Gulf and Levanta, whose grandfathers did not eagerly leave the country when they had opened restaurants with labs and calians, and were not exhausted and tortured by the flames, in fear of their own fear that the flame would absorb them by the following.
Everyone on the ability.
Since she had heard only ballades before, Eileen was difficult to understand how insulting words that Kevern had just spoken to her could have even been put on music.
Music is the expression of love.
"They are not insulting indeed," said Kevern.
Unless it may be for people who have big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He said too much, but the running garden gave him an illusion of security.
None of the words could come through the audio isolation of giant leaves that looked like capustic.
Eileen still didn't understand.
How could your father love that?
He meant to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to press two fingers at her.
She's already thought it's weird.
"He seemed ridiculous," he said instead.
She shook her head untrustedly by closing the Kevr review.
There was nothing in the world but the land of her black hair.
Nothing he'd like to look at.
"Well, if you say so," she said, staying with her opinion.
But that still doesn't explain why you're eating it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
Boats, maybe a little bit...
And you're saying you hate me because my chests are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you because you have thick ice," he tried to say instead.
I have such a perversion.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
The attempts to joke often led him to uncomfortable situations, because, like his father, he lacked the calming charm that could mitigate the cruelty of the jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons rose red and rose out of the shezlong, screwing the console and the pour of the wine they had.
The wine from the wine, so the drunkenness could not serve him as an excuse.
In her worries, she seemed to have trembled like palm leaves in the hurricane.
"And I like you because you have a stupid head," she said...
Even though you don't like you.
He regretted her and the excessive roughness of his words, and the fear that appeared in her view when she resisted him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life in a cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that she was here.
The same huge ice ocean fell on both of them.
The same men, even more sensitive and embarrassed after what has been done, if their ancestors, smugglers and destructors, were floating in a fuse from a pub to a pub, ready to raise their hand on any woman who dares to deny or irritate them.
Stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid fist if she hadn't been careful!
First, we would kiss -- now the most common expression of erotic irritation between men and women; the antidote from the fresh ballades that the console was issued -- first kiss her and then hit her.
The excessive clarification, according to Kevern, is because the kiss itself was already a cruelty.
Eileen Solomons showed that he had to leave.
He climbed out of the heel, like an old man.
She felt her own gravity, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She was watching him leave, and from the top window, watching him leave, her satellite was a man who put his weight on her own.
Adam, who was leaving the garden, thought she.
She felt an injection of compassion for him and men at all, even though some of them raised their hand on her.
The man who turned away from her, with a grieving back, beating, all the ability to fight left him - why did she feel that she knew it so well if she couldn't remember any case, until today, when she would have seen that?
Again, Eileen Solomons looked at her legs.
Twenty years before the events described above, or nearly the Esma Nussbaum, a smart and energy 32-year-old researcher who worked in Offnau, the informal public-controlled monitoring service, prepared a small report on the preservation of low and medium-level violence in the same parts of the country, where it was expected to be reduced if it did not completely stop, taking into account the funds and forces allocated to its eradication.
"A lot has been done, and many are done," she wrote, "to mitigate the inferior aggression of people who fought in thousands of wars, and most of them, especially among those confused branches and narrow districts of the area, where despite the branches of churches, the gentle breath of human kind was rarely felt throughout history.
However, some qualities appear to be inevitable.
The higher the pinches, the lower the passions he has emerged.
The population tears over sentimental ballades, swallows stories of overwhelmed obstacles and declares its dirty faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old roughness remains strong in the rural and urban communities, but there are data that new and evil harassment in homes, at work, on roads, and even in the playgrounds.
"You have an awkward habit of writing too much," said her scientist, reading the report in whole.
I think you should read less of the novels.
Esme Nussbaum's head down.
I should also ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Esma again insisted on her right to private life and silence.
Feminist?
Again, silence.
"I ask," Luther Rabinovic finally said, "not because I am against atheism, lesbian or feminism.
We don't have any prejudices here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some of the types of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and commendable by themselves, may sometimes distort the results, such as what you showed me.
Obviously, you are predicted against the church, and what you call evil and rough, others would interpret as the expression of natural irritation and energy.
Continuing to offer on the WHAT HAVE HAVE HAPPENED, as if it ever happened yesterday, would mean to deprive the country of the necessary vital force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinovic spoke.
For his head, pink, like flamingo, the light-based letters repeated the advice that Offnau gave to the country the last fourth century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, value your husband, listen to ballades, go to musicals, talk on the phone, explain, listen, accept, apologize.
Talk is better than silence, the word of song is better than the written word, but there's nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you mean," said Esma Nussbaum quietly when she made sure that her scientist had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything but that we were not cured as effectively as we persuade ourselves.
I am concerned that if we are not ready, we will find that we are repeating mistakes that have initially led to what has happened, if it has been done.
Only this time we will throw out our anger and mistrust not on others.
Luther Rabinovic connected his fingers to the pyramid.
This gesture should mean infinite patience.
"You go too far," he said, "in calling the mistakes" actions that did or did not do our grandfathers.
You're going too far and when you're saying that they threw their angers and the "nothing" on "other".
In your place, a person should not need a reminder that, understanding the past, which is, protecting the present, we are not talking about us and them.
There were no "we" and no "other".
It was a mess time -- that's all we know.
"Which, if being honest with myself, " esme dared to insert, "no part of the society can justify itself well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was bad or good - what was done, it was done.
It was then.
There's nothing more to say. We're all right here.
And as you don't have to blame anyone, you don't have to be excused if it was appropriate or if there was something to be corrected.
But why the past, if not to learn?
The past is for us to forget it.
If I can add one word to that--
Luther Rabinovica's piramida has fallen apart.
"I will consider your report," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on the way to work, she was beaten by a motorcycler who went on the trip, as the passover described, "in awful rage."
Coincidence happens.
The Army of Lesoto claims that the revolution was not planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The representatives of the army of Lesoto rejected the preparation of a revolution to reduce the Government, saying that they acted against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanaticians.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, saying that the army of the country had surrounded his official residence and captured government buildings in Maseru capital.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa, claiming that he had been threatened with an attempt on his life.
The representative of the army, Major Ntlele Ntoi, stated that there was no conversion, but that the army had responded to the threat of the “political fanatics” whom the police tried to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the command of the Lesotho Armed Forces has taken steps by receiving several intelligence reports that there are some elements that really plan to arm some political, young political party fans who were willing to create chaos," he informed the American vote.
The representative of the South African Government, Clayson Moniela, stated that the action of the army was a revolution.
"Whether no one has claimed to capture power by force, according to all the information, the actions of the armed forces of Lesoto are at present essential signs of revolution," he said.
The representatives of the army of Lesoto reported that soldiers returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, the Deputy Prime Minister Motetjoa Metsing governs the Government in the absence of Tabana.
Tabane stated that he believed that he was being attacked by attempting to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesoto was very tense since June, when Tabane suspended the parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in its united Government.
He stated that his actions were not undermined by the Government, despite the opposite charges.
The Semi-Chelsey Protector, Marco van Ginkel, will hold the forthcoming season of rent in Milan, reports Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutch will arrive in Italy in the next hour for medical survey.
In the past season, he was only three times on the field of the London club.
Recall that Milan had rented from the Liverpool attacking Fernando Torres.
Production in the eurozone at the lowest rate in 13 months
The growth of production in the eurozone slowed down to the lowest rate of 13 months in August, according to the popular study.
The latest significance of the business sector (PMI) of the European Markit production zone has fallen up to 50.7 in August, declined from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders have been delayed, and enterprises have suffered from increasing tensions between the EU and Russia in relation to Ukraine.
The European Central Bank (ECB) was accompanied by significances on Thursday.
The markets will wait for a clear plan from the bank to deal with the suspension of the eurozone, as well as the threat of deflation in the inflation of only 0.3 per cent.
There is an assumption that the ECB manager Mario Dragi later this week could provide additional signals that he was considering the quantitative mitigation scheme for the eurozone, similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although any growth is better than no growth, the brake effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers becomes more obvious," said Rob Dobson, senior economist Markit.
The PMI of the German production sector, the largest Russian trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest in 11 months of mark 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second size of the block economy, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to cause real concerns, as is the weakening of Italy from stable growth to stagnation.
The signs that the pulse of growth has exhausted mainly the industrial engine, Germany, as well as Spain and the Netherlands also did not add confidence," said Mr. Dobson.
Industrial slowness, most likely, will still exceed butter to fire analysts waiting for additional monetary or budgetary incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI grew up to 57.3 since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the principal economist of IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the August study of the Eurozone business sector's business index is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: "The eurozone producers are apparently finding life very difficult at present, since the current increased geopolitical tension, especially related to Russia/Ukraine, adds uncertainty to the complex conditions in many countries.
This increased tension was apparently hit by business - especially on consumer confidence, and it was likely that some orders were delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said "as more like that," that the ECB, of course, would have to do some sort of quantitative mitigation, "although we suspect it would be limited."
Marioupolian residents will expose a live chain against the mutuals
In Mariupol until last week, it was all calm - no one was able to organize the Mariopol People's Republic, the city in the Azov sea lived and worked.
The inhabitants now look forward to the arrival of the mutuals.
According to politiologists, separatists have been invading to Mariopol to get to the Azov Sea - recently taken from the city of Novoazsk, which was not composed of self-pronounced republics before.
The Mariupolis decided that the Ukrainian army would protect them, though, but she had little forces against the well-armed representatives of the LDCs, and was gathering to help the military.
They're sneaking roofs, building blocks and strengthening.
On Saturday night, several thousand inhabitants arrived to the eastern border of the city and stood there in a living chain, singing the hymn of Ukraine.
They are going to do the same in the event of an attack.
Volunteers collect and drive equipment and products, collect medication, issue the newspaper.
The city has gradually closed shops, banks and bankomates were stopped.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years since the horrible school, like the children in it are still suffering
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were hostaged by Czech warriors at school in Beslan, Southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of whom children were killed during this three-day test that shook the world
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who deceived death during the believing at school.
Just ten years later, after the horrible abduction of the Noslan school, during which 334 people died, including 186 children who survived a heroic disaster warned about the new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatici, captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, it seemed to be somewhat extremely possible evil.
The tragedy united the east and west in disgusting, which then remarkably increased into action and hope for the future under the most difficult tribulation.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who have deceived death during the beast in school.
We have discovered amazing youths who opposed the trouble, although the memories of terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now tormenting Ukraine, where children like them are dying, will now end.
A girl who's trying to get back to the shooting sports hall.
It was sealed on a picture of a famous Russian photographer, Dmitri Beljakov, when she tried to get back in one underwear to the shooting sports hall after the mine explosion.
In the distress, Aida was desperately looking for her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There were fears that they both died, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run all the way, but I couldn't," said Aida then.
My legs were covered with blood.
I got up and climbed back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a row of operations, she thought she was completely recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
A few pieces left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become dentist, to help people just as the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't break it," she said with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and it can't change that fact.
Once a year, I'm always going to this sports hall to remember everyone who's staying there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Jara Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we wanted to go to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish my school and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says it remains with her, although the memories are a little miserable every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help that we have received from people from Britain and everywhere.
When I see a photo on the Internet where I'm climbing into the school window, I think many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and make it no longer happen.
The boy who ran through the city of bullets, thinking his mother was dead.
It was his first day at school (the Russians start school at 7 years) and he survived three days of excitement by huging his mother Tamara.
Then he was seven years old, and he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her for the hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said, "Run."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the road, grabbed the child for his hand and ran through the city of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was free and was in a hospital with leg wounds, in turn thinking that her son died.
After their reunion, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe that.
He ran away and hugged me.
Damir was later brought to London (the current News of the World), where he was rewarded as the Protector of Children's Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sherry.
"This horror returns to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him," he said yesterday.
Anyway, I can tell you, he's missing me.
I remember the moment I threw out all my toy weapons right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that sports hall, but I don't think of myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard that never got out.
We never say they're killed or dead.
We're saying they're staying in the sports hall.
I remember my journey to London so well, especially a toy store where I was allowed to choose everything I want, and a ride in a car with an open top.
But now he fears for places such as Ukraine, where wars lead to the grief that he and his friends have experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who worked volunteer work last week in a female monastery.
I want to help.
I want to serve in the police someday and I hope I'll be recruited at the school academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the horrible silence right after the quest, just there were no children who would scream and run around, and this silence continued for months.
She remembers her trip with Damir to London.
People in London cried when I told our story.
When I realized how people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, they could provide support.
She was grateful to " Sherry Blair and her fund for the reward and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I'd like to call Sherry and just tell her that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borsz, they called all local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waitress in the restaurant, Damir shot them from his water gun, and they fled and played with him.
And it was just a month after our nightmare then.
I was excited that the British were so willing to divide our pain and support us.
She said, "I don't think this world's been better for these 10 years.
There's a war in Ukraine now, people die every day, and I think a lot of children were killed and killed.
They're just the same kids as ours.
I think for many people the war is a news report they're listening to when they're bored or when they're busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, and he is not at all aggressive or evil.
He's not looking for mess, for example, he's not in this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the sports hall sometimes and burn candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
I didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
And I remember how he threw out all his weapons and other military toys.
I can't believe that I was so sure that he died for a few hours and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and get on my feet, I looked around, and I saw hell around me when parts of the bodies lied everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could survive in this hell.
"I remember screaming to him, "Damir, run, run," but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and escaped.
This is how life continues for us, unlike so many others.
George Illin, 17 years old
The boy whose shocking photograph after the capture has become a determination for the tragedy in Beslan
Peace: The survivor of Beslan Georgie Illin with his mother Fatima after the invasion in 2004 and Georgia's right today
His bleeding face had a fearprint when he was saved from death, when the Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking barbaric symbols in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, the Chief Doctor, took him to school on the first day of school before taking the senior son of Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before terrorists ran into court, so my little boy left alone for three days of nightmare," she recalled.
Not exactly alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
My only Georgia survived.
The closer this date, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There's no day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days all the time in front of me.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
It enters the soul: Georgia's photograph (left) was one of the most shocking attacks and was eternal in the sculpture (right)
I remember that George wanted to go to school the day he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I just found out he's alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of Georgia's crying in San Marino.
Georgie doesn't like to look at this picture, and it's hidden in the bookbox in our house.
I understand, but I also feel that this photograph makes people from around the world feel our pain.
Georgius now says, "It's important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never learn the truth.
Now they're investigating this Boing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what it was caused?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need tens of years to forget her a little bit.
She affected my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years I dreamed of nightmares because of the excitement, but now it's getting better.
I returned to school later in 2004, and I was terrified every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this sports hall every 1 September.
I want to give the memory to my old friends of childhood.
It's hard for me to go into the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I don't feel victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life continues.
I graduated from school this year and went to medical university in Vladikawaz.
I'll learn to be a cardiac surgeon.
My first choice was to go to the army.
I wanted to be a military person, but my health didn't allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgi Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived despite the murderer's feet.
Unbelievable: Georgi Farniev was at the foot of a terrorist who had been caught, but still survived.
During the seizure, he was photographed in the sports room sitting next to the bomb at the foot of the terrorist killer.
Really, it's a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was just yesterday," said Georgie, who wanted to study for an Intelligence Officer at the FSB, but couldn't do it because of the damage caused by his health during capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say the kids are easy to deal with bad events - I have to say it's not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the next year, was the first and last time I entered this sports hall again.
I've lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show where I was sitting on this famous photograph.
Personal: George Farneyev today with a photo of himself open on the laptop in the hospital after capture
My pain is enormous, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
With regard to the physical condition, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm walking well.
But health didn't let me go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical opinions, and they said that it was impossible.
My second interest was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've studied there for two years.
He's learning to treat all animals from cats to cows.
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
This is not what children should know, and of course not what they must experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary is coming.
I'll go and attend the ceremony that will be held to mark it.
I know Georgie won't go.
It should be even stronger for him because he was there, and I didn't.
I was waiting for him home and I couldn't help.
I'm so grateful to God he came back to me.
He's staying with us.
George is now adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something's so unfair, it's happening to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it because of his knees.
He had a few operations, he can walk, but he can't sport.
I'd say he's overcome this nightmare 50%, but it's impossible to overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the quest, and that only strengthens my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well, and they were my expenses.
My son with me, and it's the best gift God could do to me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life continues, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what happens in the world - wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how did it turn out we're fighting now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure a lot of children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If we could grab all the rebels and throw away as far as possible.
Alena Zkaeva, 10 years old
A bride who was touched to the safe place of a specialist
Saved: Allen Zkaev is carrying a Russian specialist (left) to a safe place.
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't even remember a monster crime.
The world had stopped breathing in 2004 when a Russian police officer took Alenna in his hands from the school captured in Beslan.
The terrorists released her, but her 30 - year - old mother, the 10 - year - old sister Christine and brother Mahara left her in the school sports room.
Mahar, who was then three years old, was saved, but Alona’s mother and sister died in a death fight.
Her father Ruslan has been married again since then, and they and his new wife Lightlana have a little daughter he called Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alon, who is now ten, has nothing to remember about the entrepreneurship and blooming into a smart and joyful girl, the neighbors say.
"They are a great happy family now, and Alana and Mahar are both beautiful children," said a close friend.
Ruslan is a brilliant father and wants to keep them away from all the memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can understand why.
Semi-protected Sindhi Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Dortmund's Borsay, noted that he was eager to regain the field in the form of a German club.
He said this transfer is a joyful event in his career.
Of course, I'm very glad to play for "Brussia" again," the Bild of Kagawa's words.
I feel very good.
A lot of positive emotions and I'm looking forward to coming back to the Borussia field.
Recall, Kagawa was transferred to the MU from Borussia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he could not be able to build up the English club by conducting only 38 matches in the English championship for two seasons, slamming six balls and giving 8 efficient transfers.
A man accused of a girl on a pediatric transition to Fife
A 78-year-old man will be presented in court of charge of a three-year-old girl on a pelican transition to Fife.
Gordon Stuart must have hit a girl at the Pittenwin east Newcastle.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Stuart had led his Audi Q3 without due attention and beat the girl as a result of a trauma.
Stuart, 78, from Anstruter, denied his guilt at the Dandy Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles McNire, a royal attorney, appointed the date of the court on January.
Obama, Merkel and Olland are not loaded in Vladivostok
The Duty Free Airport Trade Store of the Vladivostok Airport Hanged a table that prohibits buying in this store a number of world political leaders.
Don't bother them with ghosts, vodka and horses.
The shop Administration decided that US President Barak Obama, Chancellor of FRG Angela Merkel, President of France François Ollland, Vitalius Kličko, Julia Timošenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other known companions would not be able to get charged with vodka, horses and ghosts in their shop.
And she hanged a table on the door.
Rather, Obama was prohibited from appearing in even less accessible to him in the facility - the diet meals of IAU, as reported by the community's site.
Whether the American President had a dream ever eating in a diet dining meal in Russia, it is not known, but the authors of the bans clearly seem to be awfully clever.
Is there cheese after embargo: Medvedev advised agrarias
Russia's Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev believes that, in the conditions of the embargo, Russian agriculturals, new technologies should be acquired in order to educate emissions from cheese buyers.
The Council was given during the visit of the Yugticeptor company Agrocomplex.
The head of the Government also advised the restaurants to reorient the Russian meat, whose quality is at the right level.
The annual food embargo was introduced in Russia since 7 August.
The Chief Coach of Russia, Valentin Maslakov, was pleased with the outcome of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, the third is a good result, taking into account the lack of targeted training for competition.
Our sportsmen have spoken at their level - the whole sports of Maslakov's words.
Third place is to confirm our high-level level.
It's nice that the advantage of the French and even Americans above us is minimum.
We're not preparing for these competitions.
The season is over, and we have not bound our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we have become seconds in this tournament, but in this season we have been renewed.
The French, on the contrary, exhibited a competitive team, including 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, as they have publicly announced.
But even such a competitive composition could not resist the Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have spoken in such a representative company at a good level.
But some of the results were below the same Briliant League.
Season finished.
Of course, sportsmen are not so important anymore, even more in team level competitions.
The main thing was here is the place.
And as a result, it was absurd when men were so excited by tactical tricks of running that they showed the result of the medium-level... women's races.
4 Tips of how to achieve better quality of submarine photos and videos
If you want to photograph or take a video underwater, there are a number of options for your apparatus.
The cheapest option is a water-indistinct "mill", for example Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an ex-camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for approximately $300.
I took these photos on a family holiday with several cameras, all at a price of about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, several rules must be respected in order to achieve best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterless camera, make sure that the battery and other departments are closed.
Furthermore, set your camera for the type of photos or videos you will take.
Some photos and video cameras have film modes or types of object that optimize the exposure for the dark underwater conditions.
And before jumping into the water, find out how deep your apparatus can fall.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our customer's leadership and ratings of digital cameras for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few shots, because many of them won't work.
There's a basketball that will help you compose the photos, while the accelerators usually don't have them.
Even if you have HCD, it will be difficult to see under water, and the frame will be a random process.
So do a few кадрs.
Also, if your camera has a serial recording mode that takes a few shots with a little different exposure installations, use it.
Stay in the surface.
The number of lights is significantly lowering than you dive underwater.
If possible, stay at the surface when you take off the pool, the river or the ocean.
This will also allow you to pass more colors on the photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Swim closer to the film objects.
This is an excellent council for land shooting, but it is even more important under water because of the dark light conditions.
Especially important if you take off the eschen camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle socket, which means you have to get closer to the film objects if you want to fill the frame.
The 2012 Olympic Olympic Olympic Games Bronze, for the free fight of Billial Machov, could be converted into Greek-Rome fight.
This was reported by the chief coach of Dagestan on the free fight of Sajid Sajid.
The specialist did not exclude the participation of the sportsman in the world championship in Taskente in September 2014.
Currently, Billiel Mahov is at the " classic" team, "R-Sport" the words of Sajid Sajid.
In fact, Billial was both speaking.
At the youth of the 2005 world, he became the winner of the tournament of volunteers and the third tour in the Greek-Rimian competition and decided to focus on the free fight.
A long time ago, talks that the new stage of our career will take our difficulty in the Greek-Rome fight.
I'll tell you more: Machov can already be at the world champion in Taschent, if he wins the contest.
But the crucial word is always behind the coach head of Goghi Koguashville.
Andrew Lawson was a person whose power of person could have struck everything around, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
The consulting anesthesiologist devoted his career to rescue patients from both the suffering of the disease and the pain of treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife recalled a MI6 officer who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson understood that while the doctor was involved in diagnosis and diseases, those who were treated mainly had something else to worry about -- pain.
Once in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel like usual," he wrote in May last year.
It was hard for me to find strength.
When he fought the symptoms like the flu, he discovered that he irritated his wife, Juliet.
"I want this to happen faster than later," he said.
When Juliet left for a week, Lawson found out that he was unusual and unbelievable why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to make a chest cell rentgen.
Just two weeks earlier, he was riding skies in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray came.
It was mezoteloma, incurable cancer that affects the plumber, or the lung shell.
For most cancers, it is difficult to figure out the exact reason.
Although some smokers have cancer of lungs, not all patients with cancer have been smoking.
But the mezotheliom is different.
Almost in all cases, the cause is to contact asbestos, the fiber building material, which was once called a miracle, but which is now known as deadly dangerous.
For most of us, mezotheliom is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbest, eventually, is a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the recommended industrial ban has entered into force.
Even when it was used, only individuals from specific sectors were working closely with him: pipe isolationers, builders, carpenters and docks workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era, it can hardly be caused for anxiety today.
But such calm is wrong.
Great Britain appears to be on the epidemia of mezotheliom today.
Here more people die from mezotheliom than in any other country on the planet.
In the annual mortality, approximately 2500 people die more than twice as many as the result of car accidents.
Annual deaths from mezotheliom since 1980 and the predicted number of deaths in the future in Britain
The reason why we now feel his death implications is that, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (as all types of asbestos were eventually prohibited in 1999), the development of mezothelioms is usually declined for decades.
And the attack of mezothelioms is not limited to the veterans of industrial construction.
Asbest was, and in many cases remains, placed in houses where we live, offices where we work, schools where we learn, and stores where we go for shopping.
As a result, mezothelioma does not pay attention to the class, the level of enrichment, profession or age.
Election basions, from fashioned London universities to private schools, turned out to be no rescue.
The parliamentary building was induced by asbestos.
Even hospitals designed to treat us have proved to be reservations of this deadly cancerogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a pipe isolator.
In fact, he had to think where he could contact the asbestos.
Then he took the mind.
"It appears to have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels in Gaia, where I spent six years in the internship," he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors and loaders used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will be sick with the same disease.
It was a question that, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"From four doctors who have been internified in the Gaia hospital and have later developed mezotheliom in the past five years," he noted in his letter in 2010, "I am one alive."
How many of us will be sick of this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed "mezotheliom" when he was 48 years old.
When he died, on February 17, this year, he was 55.
Living so long is unusual.
Fifty percent of the patients with mezotheliom die eight months after diagnosis.
She's always dead.
So now we can just repeat the Lawson question, "How many of us will be sick with the same disease?"
According to the leading mezotheliom expert in Britain, Professor Julian Pito is most likely to assume that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Great Britain should survive, about 90,000 people will die.
Most people don't think they're going to die this way.

The rapid review of court records, where the victims are often looking for compensation, shows how far the attack of mezotheliom has been spread.
In this June, for example, Marks & Spencer recognized that Janice Ellen had been contacted with asbestos.
She worked in the net for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, leading the clothing departments on two facilities, one of which was the main store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children aged 20 years.
"Before it happened," she said, "I never heard of mezotheliom, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn't even think that would touch me.
Some people really know about asbestos.
In fact, asbest is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They have received their title from the word "asbestiform " which means a fiber structure that gives them the strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
The crysothil, widely known as white asbestos, is often convened in buildings today.
It was used in shelter panels, attached tiles, thermoisolution of pipes, thermoisolution of the stomachs, even in brakes of cars.
It is less mortal than other forms of asbestos, but yet recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a serious source of health damage, which could lead to death.
More dangerous, however, is brown asbest (amosis) and blue asbest (crokidolit).
Britain was once the biggest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that "exist strong, though indirect grounds to believe that this is the main reason for the exclusively high number of patients with mezotheliom [in Britain]."
Marks & Spencer was affected by asbestos in Oxford Street, London Alamy
Janice Ellen may not think of herself as a typical mezotheliom victim, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her history is far more unusual.
He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that “relevant percentage of mezotellium, when no known impact on work or at home, was likely caused by an environmental asbestos”.
The majority of this impact, he said, is due to the " usual use and weather" on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The report Goddard Consulting, in which the Westminster Palace was discussed, shows how people, even in the centre of the government, could have been affected unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines behind parliamentary committees were infected by asbestos, whose death fibres could be carried into something as harmless as the " strong air flows".
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in that case it appears to be contrary.
While the Directorate for Technical Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a " clean sanitation certificate", she now recognized that it was necessary to carry out a £1 billion for the reconstruction of the parliament by improving electricity and removing asbest and that, after the 2015 universal elections, members of the parliament might be meeting in the QE2 conference centre nearly, not in Westminster's green stores.
The Goddard report noted that “the situation with asbestos was not managed in accordance with different rules”.
It is not possible to find out whether this management error will be worth life.
All we can do now is wait.
One of those who have never been able to detect their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor of general practice.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50 years old, he suspects that he was affected by the asbestos when he worked in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital that had been successfully prosecuted with asbestos," he said, "But I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places I worked and dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was hit by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45 years old, and he was in the middle of the surgery late tonight.
Suddenly, I got a fever.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the plumber, the shells around the lungs.
But, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mezothelia.
Finally, he couldn't go to work for a month.
The confused physicians painted the rentgens of the breast cell and placed the plural categories to extract the fluid from the lungs and send it to the analysis.
However, his condition remained unavailable.
His health has gradually improved, and he has returned to work.
At times, however, the same symptoms were returned, often after he was sporting and breathing.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to him in a reception with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed "mezothelioma".
However, even then Abbott did not link this to his own case.
Finally, his patient was ten years older and worked directly with asbestos.
The connection was obvious in this case.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition had deteriorated again, and his doctor, who consulted, showed his results of the CTC and the X-ray photos to the team of experts.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott began to feel bad, the camera-equipped sensor was placed in the area between his breast cell and its lung shell.
I'm a optimist.
I usually just go on," he says.
I didn't worry too much about it, honestly.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of biopsy came on a week between Christmas and New Year, "I was told that it was mezotheliom."
Graham Abbott: diagnosticated mezotheliom
Suddenly, Abbott went to a meeting with Macmillan nurses, one of whom invited him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"Asbest appears to be used widely, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos termoisolution was quite often used on pipes," he said.
People who have been affected by asbestos in these buildings are now sick of this disease.
Thus, mezothelioma is now impressed by more young people of untipical professions.
The most dangerous asbestos isolated pipes in the hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that patients suffer.
But many of the officers who walked through the tunnels to get from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson), or eating in the basement tables (as often Graham Abbott did) were almost surely affected by a toxic substance.
During a few decades after the war, hospitals appeared to have been a place where, theoretically, they saved life for patients, but a place that threatened their lives for the doctors who were treated.
It's still being removed today.
Students set up Bunzen's heats for asbestos
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbest was often used in offices, shops, libraries and cities because of its amazing isolation and firearms.
Schools, too.
In fact, many were likely the first time affected by the asbestos in the class.
In many chemical lessons across the country, school students set up Bunzen's heat on asbestos.
Web sites showed attention to the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, unharmed things, such as the nail tiles or roofs of the bark, usually contained asbest.
"This is an industrial poison placed in a large number of our buildings," noted Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against the hospital of Gai.
In one case, the only contact that a sick woman could remember was the presentation of the garden barn in the 1970s.
So be careful, wear garden barns.
The effect of the diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is insecurable, is enormous.
"To realize this, it takes a long time," said Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I had to go and deal with myself.
Well, I won't meet Christmas again.
One of the most difficult things was to move from the doctor's situation to the patient.
As a countless number of patients before him, he remembers how he was distracted by the volume of information that had to be taken.
"It was hard to realize," he said.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
I've been given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I won't meet Christmas again.
That's it."
Mezotheliom is particularly dangerous, because the mechanism of how we support our life is, the very act of breathing, causes a cancer that kills.
Most of the cases of mezothelioms have been associated with asbestos.
Asbest consists of tiny fibres.
When the asbestos is destroyed and the fibres breathe, they can be stuck in the plug, the lung shell.
The asbestos fibres are irritating the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is due to the breathing of the needle fibres of the asbestos," Professor Tom Treger, a cardiac surgeon who arrived in the Gaya hospital in 2001.
This is the hospital where, as Andrew Lawson suspected, it has been affected by the asbestos, now, in irony of fate leading the Centre for the Treatment of Mezotheliom.
The Trader knew Louson and healed some others who were likely affected by internship in the hospital.
When the needles of the asbestos fall into the tissue of the lungs, Trager says, "their breath is pushing them to the peripheral where the shell is.
This is, in fact, an invasive process from the beginning.
The ordinary treatment of other forms of cancer is much less effective in mezotheliom.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, causes hot disputes.
Some people think it's worth trying.
The treasure doesn't agree.
"It's impossible to cut the pleura," he said.
It can't be around her with a knife.
In the meantime, this cancer is not very well subjected to chemical therapy, which acts, but does not heal.
"Some time there are sick people who live long," said Trager.
But eventually, they're all dying.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than they are expected.
The writer Stephen J. Guld died 20 years after diagnosis was diagnosed.
Two and a half years after diagnosis was set, Graham Abbott continued to fight.
After he was ill, Abbott was acquainted with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after diagnosis, became a single support and consultation bureau for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central," he said joyfully when they called.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energy.
At first, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months to extend his life for a month.
"I was desperate," he said.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, has been facing to add a little more positive paint.
Following a meeting with several experts, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loik Lang-Lazdunski, professor of the toracial surgery in the hospital of Gaya.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need a direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," Graham admits.
The medium statistical patient would have to receive the direction and approval of funding.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mezotheliom to obtain the best treatment available.
However, when such treatment is finally ineffective, many patients face another financial cause for anxiety — the future of the families they leave.
And then they ask courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Asbest has been known to be harmful since 1898," said Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it became clear that even very small quantities could risk health.
That's when the companies were incorporated.
Andrew Lawson and Gaya's hospital eventually resolved the case, but it was not a full-value settlement, Morgan said, since Lawson was unable to clearly prove that his mezotheliom was the result of contact with asbestos in the Gaia hospital.
After the investigation of his death, the representative of the Gaya hospital confirmed, however, that the “asbest in the basement rooms mentioned in the 1990s was removed”.
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, to link death contact with one company or workplace -- usually ten years later -- has been a major problem for patients with mezotheliom who demand compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed their owners or closed them.
The insurance archives could have been lost.
And those who are protected from the claims know that on their side the time of the prosecutors is of course not.
In response this year, serious new legislative acts have been made to facilitate the mezotheliom recovery process, even if their former employers could not be tracked.
In accordance with this law, a $350 million fund fund funded by the insurance industry was established for those who had been diagnosed after July 2012 and who could prove contact but no one to judge.
In such cases, the patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could condemn in a normal case of compensation - approximately $120,000.
Approximately 300 successful claims are expected every year.
Andrew Morgan, as many who work with mezotheliom patients, believes that $350 million are "excellent jobs" for the insurance industry.
"It is a deal written by insurance providers," he said, indicating that the amount is about a quarter of what the insurance officers would have to pay if they had not intervened a temporary interval and the patients with mezotheleom could track the companies and file a complaint in a normal way.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Retirement, admitted that the law was "infinite".
However, both Penning and Morgan recognize that, when seven people die every day, rapid action was needed.
"The people suffer so much, and they need help today," said Penning during the second reading of Bill about mezotheliom in December last year.
Until then, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Professor Loika Lang Lázdunski 19 months.
After the primary consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considered effective.
Therapy and chemotherapy followed this, a triterapy in which Lang-Lazdunski could commend 40 per cent of the survivors in five years.
Abbott felt the inflammation of force.
"This is, of course, one of the most important things," said Abbott.
You see this in patients all the time.
There's some power that supports you.
When you surrender, the condition may be worsen very quickly.
Graham Abbott had an operation in March 2012.
By the end of August, he completed the last six of the chemical cycles.
The following scans did not show any sign of disease.
Then I was scanning in March [2014].
There were several spots [cake] in my breast cell.
I was supposed to be 50.
It's not a threat of life.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
There's no sign of tumors now.
However, this process is both physically and emotional.
You can think of practical things - about finances when I die, for example, or how to show my wife, how the battery timer works.
When you get bad news, you get unhappy.
We need to look forward.
Like Ellie's father, 16 years old, and Tamzin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he said.
It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.
When I was diagnosed for the first time, I told the girls that I had a disease, which means I'm not getting older.
They reacted very differently.
Temzine is very communicative and energy.
She told all her friends, and many of us called very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something you have to face with all the sick cancer.
However, such discussions are not balanced with hope for patients with mezotheliom, even with a flash of survival.
This disease brings a dark determination for Steven Jay Guld (even eventually).
As Andrew Morgan says, "mezotheliom is not a threat of life.
The bodies of the balsamated Pharaohs are turned into asbestos.
The asbestos fibres are used to strengthen the cattle and to increase heat.
Plinius Senior describes asbest.
It's now invented a plastic that doesn't burn.
I've seen the scarlets made of it squirreling in the chimneys on the bankets.
The modern commercial use of the asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to produce a paper (even banknote) and tissues.
The large asbest mines are opened in Canada and South Africa and soon after that in America, Italy and Russia.
It's a perfect heat isolator for pair engines and turbines of the Industrial Revolution.
World production of asbestos increases to more than 30,000 tonnes a year.
The Prudential statistics show early mortality among those working with asbestos and who are therefore rejected in life insurance.
Nelly Kershaw is dying in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cook testifies that the particles of the asbestos in her lungs were "in no doubt the main cause of death".
It's the first case of this type.
The employees of Kershaw, Turner Bros Asbestos, do not accept responsibility.
The compensation is not paid.
During World War II, a shipbuilding is developing intensely, one of the most dangerous professions in relation to asbestos.
Voluntary industrial prohibition for the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal reaffirms the first successful suit against the health caused by contact with asbestos in Britain.
World production of asbestos grows to more than 4213,000 tonnes a year.
Britain imports 139,000 tonnes.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Security in Great Britain requires all asbetic contractors to receive licences.
Import and use of blue and brown asbestos are prohibited in British law.
All uses of asbestos are prohibited in Britain.
The Mezotheliom Act was adopted in Britain.
Compensation scheme £350 million declared.
Asbest is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but the white asbest is still used in cheap construction materials in many parts of the world.
World production is held at approximately 2 million tons a year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters swear to revenge
China's Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow the Hong Kong voters to bring candidates to the elections of 2017, despite the growing demands of democratic reform.
Such a move would probably start the promising protests in the Hong Kong business block, since the activists began planning and mobilization in the estimated hours after that statement.
The decision of the All-China People's Meeting, in fact, allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It has not deceived our expectations, but it still makes it angry," said the Legislator Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And obviously we're dealing with the authoritarian regime.
Protecting China's decision, Lee Faye, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the All-Kinean People's Assembly, said that allowing the international election of the head of Hong Kong would be too " chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain has transmitted control over Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised that the residents of the region will be allowed to vote by voting by the head of the Government, starting since 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the decision taken on Sunday as a democratic step forward, since it gives the Hong Kong the right to direct vote; but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the support of the Peking candidates strictly controlled.
And, according to the new article, only candidates who love and love Hong Kong will be allowed.
The decision was taken after the summer, when one of the largest and widest protests in Hong Kong had been made for many years.
A large part of the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers threatened to close the Hong Kong financial area unless Beijing guarantees this universal elective right.
On Sunday night, a few hours after the statement, hundreds of Occupy Central were gathered in the rain in front of the headquarters of the Government of Hong Kong.
At the demonstration, the organizers stated that their movements would move to a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would rise at the waves of protest in the next weeks.
Nevertheless, they did not report details, apparently trying to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, organizers reported that the movement " had been considering the possibility of capture of the central area only as an exceptional measure, actions that could be taken only if all the possibilities of dialogue were exhausted and no other choice.
We are regretted that all the possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and the central area will certainly be taken.
State authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's statement for several days, and on Sunday, the Government ' s headquarters had increased security measures with police and barricades.
Based on the disorder, many in Hong Kong feel that they slowly lose control of their own city.
The influx of inhabitants from the country increases competitiveness in the field of goods and services.
The fear is also increasing that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, have become weaker under a growing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations are risking the business source of the Hong Kong life force.
"The protest they are talking about may lead to great economic damage depending on how much people will participate and how long," said Regina Ip's legislation, which has long been criticizing the movement.
We don't want the concern that Hong Kong is out of control.
This is a concept that is harmful for investments.
China's public media also reported on the last days where Hong Kong activists of democratic movement were shown by diversants directed by Western Powers.
This summer, the activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780,000 participants, more than one fifth of the Hong Kong voters.
And in July, tens of thousands were exposed to one of the largest prodemocratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
America's graduation culture comes to university life: first-classmen were invited to arrive on a private plane
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the first in Britain the Lux Passport Service for current students.
In order to impress the arrival of university, the company also offers transport options such as a private plane, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stuart also stated that the service had thought of security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their stuff across the country in a dangerous car.
In conjunction with our new VIF options, we look forward to helping students this year reach the university with minimal efforts and the maximum of luxury.
The representative of the company reported that since the service has just been launched, orders have not yet been made, but added that “the students will start ordering this service in the next few weeks”.
The company also stated that, despite the need for students to pay $9,000 per year, it still hopes to find a market for that service.
The current students are quite different from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago about expectations and hopes: more important than ever, to make a great first impression, and the VIF is exactly what it takes to do.
Nevertheless, the National Union of Students has criticized this service as an unrealistic.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of NSA for Higher Education, said: "This project seems incredibly open from the lives of most students.
Many students who will start a university in this month face a crise of life cost when the available financial support in the form of loans and grants does not succeed in rapidly growing expenses on basic needs before they can even start thinking about getting thousands of pounds for something like a simple arrival in a living room.
Feminists raised the issue of racial jurisdiction and the conduct of the police after Ferguson
A unarmed adolescent was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come up, scanding, "Right up, don't shoot," while they wait in a row before the funerals.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri related to the murder of a unarmed adolescent Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed an interview between white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminist women who had been commenting were putting gender above racial supplies when it was about the promotion of reproductive rights and inequality of income.
However, as the voltage in the Middle West increased and attracted national attention, Perez saw the responses of white women, which focused 100 per cent on raciality.
In comparison with the reaction of black women shortly after the death of 9 August, the personal esejs of titles such as " Ferguson's thoughts from the face of a white woman" and "feminism -- not only about the oppression of women" appeared relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a substantial movement.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin and privileges at that high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic for the crisis we faced, and because (Ferguson's situation) is so bound to race, they felt that it was necessary to point out.
For an English professor at the Ohio University of Coryta Mitchell Ferguson, Mitchell Ferguson has found problems with which black Americans face each day, but which are not considered "wife problems" in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and I get 150 liquors from everywhere," Mitchell said.
When I write anything about how colored people are attacked in their own country, silence deafs.
"Why are women safe to speak publicly about relations, but not public security?" she asked.
For black women, such as Mitchell, who studied the issues of race, gender and sexuality in the United States history, there is no dichotomy between issues relating to racial and gender.
In her view, black women are in the position to clearly divide these problems; they face complex reality every day.
While white women are now combining racial and gender issues in the feminist master, Angela Hattery, a professor of women and gender studies at the University of George Mason, said that their predecessors were doing the opposite.
" Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were linched, and almost always served by the rape of a white woman," said Hettery.
A white woman needed to confirm the story to justify the linching.
In view of Hettery, the breakdown between white and black women occurred when white sufragers, for example, Susan B. Anthony, studied the situation at the end of the 1800 ’ s and saw that struggle for electoral law would only be effective for one of the groups: women or black people.
"They have decided to put all the eggs in the basket of vote for women, and the right to vote for black people should have appeared later," said Hettery.
Looking back at such things gives us a clear idea why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women had reached the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to combine white women against linching to the Southern Women's Association for Prevention of Linching.
This group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From the point of view, Mitchell, the response of white feminists to problems raised by the situation in Ferguson, the conduct of the police, racial discrimination, reflects the time when white feminists had to " provoke" problems that black women had dealt with in several generations.
"Yes, would it be great if activists with such [traditional feminist] ideology were also serious to raise the child as they refer to the right to contraception?" Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second wave, who have made careers to combat reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now beginning to realize what this means.
A famous white feminist activist, Gloria Steinne, two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, used the Facebook and published a sharp article of Guardian Rebecca Carroll, which required white Americans to participate more in racism protests.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the danger of the body - and the perspective of racial issues that differ significantly in public surveys - will be in the head of the change," she wrote.
Although Stein is guaranteed for more cross-border feminism, which includes racial problems and gender, its comments on race in America are still surprised by some.
The American Entrepreneurial Institute Cristina Summers, author of the "Who stole feminism?", said She The People that young men in the United States, particularly colored young people, "mighty more vulnerable than their sisters," but the Steinne's criticism of Ferguson contradicted to the criticism she had previously expressed.
Now we have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small programme, “Saver to my brother”, to help vulnerable black and Spanish youths, many feminists, including Gloria Steinne, responded angryly.
Police relations with the black community are not the only problem that promotes the front line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. border service arrested about 63,000 minors without accompanying the south-western border this year, the reform of immigration regained, this time as a problem of women.
Andrea Mercado, Co-Chair of We Belong Together, the organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that she had only to share the history of immigrant women in order to present this problem as important to women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the overwhelming majority of work visas are issued to [the men-migrants], women who come with them are in positions vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"Those stories have a response from women's organizations," she said.
The Ipswich house with pigs is selling
The photo of the house offered for sale in Saffolka was removed by real estate agents when it turned out to be a large pig in the living room.
For sale for $120,000, a separate house with one bedroom stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was different from the photo of the living room, where a pig with the head of the couch was drawn.
Connell's real estate agency reported that the pig on the photo is a household pet.
"Surely, the photograph has been deployed and has already been removed," the representative of the company reported.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former house of the congregations as "a unique house with one bedroom."
Although the Agency removed the photograph from its website, it remains in advertising materials.
The sale of the house caused interest in social networks where some asked whether pigs were sold along with the house.
The Russian tennisman, Maria Sharapova, in the fourth round of the US Open, departing from Caroline Wozniatzki, believes that she is lacking stability.
According to the sportsman, she wished to finish a year decently and to try to get to a new level, transmitted by Vasilia OSIP from New York.
How would you generally appreciate your results in the Big Helmet tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad I won Rolan Harros.
With regard to the other three tournaments, I was lacking stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
I couldn't even get to the quarterfinal.
What tasks do you have before the end of the season?
After an injury, I have a huge motivation to get to a new level.
I have something to do, and I'm going to do my best to finish a year worthy.
The Asian series of tournaments begins in a few weeks.
Member of the Committee of the State of Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former champion of the world, Nikolai Valuew, proposed that the GTO beneficiary beneficiary beneficial when acquiring a tire.
He said that normalities will be the same as in the Soviet time - people will give the rules for dragging, running and other exercises.
Recall, 12 subjects of Russia will begin to implement from 1 September in their territory of the standard of GTO.
I also invited school students who gave GTO to give bonuss when they enter a tire,” noted Valuev.
For example, they can be added to EGE scores.
There are also proposals to provide additional outdoor workers with the sports tests.
There was a new millionaire in Harvey City in South Wales after winning the lottery.
The Harvey lottery player this month.
There is a search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth, where one lucky man will take home almost $1.1 million from the lottery game on Saturday night.
The paper kiosk in Harvey brings gold to the main prize for the second time in five years, the last win was $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful winner still has to declare himself.
The owner of the store, Steve Forward, said that the winner caused a victory in a small town to the southwest of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and everyone is very excited.
We thought that win could be a secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated the primary prize last month, noting the completion of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week, the Canning Weil player became one of the five million of August, following a huge $7.5 million winning of a couple from Belmont just a few weeks before.
The winner has been playing for 20 years and has reported that the winner has given them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new home.
The Harvey's millionaire brings the number of winners of the main prizes in Western Australia up to 59 this year, with a total of $85 million.
Mini-economic development wishes to accelerate the growth of the electrical car market
This week, the Ministry's Deputy Director of the Ministry of Oleg Plužnikov, at the round table held in the Moscow Carroll, will introduce an integrated plan for the development of environmentally clean transport in Russia.
The plan is commissioned by the Government, one of the main objectives is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document was expected to be adopted at the end of September - early October, said Plužnikov, the proposed measures relating to electric vehicles and hybrids - a plan for the development of vehicles on gas-fuel in Russia already existed.
The plan (copies) is calculated for 2014-2017.
The criteria for evaluation of electrical and hybrid transport are to be developed and decide how to stimulate the use and production of clean vehicles.
The report of the Government, in which tax and tariff support measures will be described, will be prepared by December 2014; the leasing and leasing scheme will be developed by April 2015; proposals to reduce the price of vehicles, to stimulate localization and to create service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, amendments to regulatory and legal acts should be made to facilitate the conditions for the construction of charged infrastructure (on parking stations, landing stations, etc.).
Furthermore, federal officials intend to make proposals for the regional authorities to encourage the use of environmentally clean transport, in the form of the provision of the advantages in the movement and parking, for example; and by February 2016, and proposals for promoting the procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the mineconomic development will make a list of indicators for the evaluation of the activities of the regional authorities, reflecting the effectiveness of environmentally clean transport production, the development of charged infrastructure.
The electric vehicle market in Russia has only been formed -- in 2013, about 100 electric vehicles were sold throughout the country.
At the beginning of 2014, the imports of electrical vehicles were renewed, so the sales would be approximately 500 grand, foretold by the Chief Executive Director Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey Pankov.
However, five-fold growth does not make electrical vehicles any significant: in 2013, in Russia, according to the European Business Association, 2.78 million light and light commercial vehicles were sold.
Only Mitsubishi Motors is imported to Russia.
The Renault company is primarily targeted by corporate clients, said the Director for Strategic Planning and Partnerships in Russia, Nicola Remiz.
Most other electric transport producers have taken a waiting position on Russia.
Electric vehicles are also developed by Russian producers - " , GAZ, " , but poor.
For example, in January-July 2014, according to ASM-cholding, the AutoVAZ released 30 electric vehicles.
The demand is low because of the expense of electrical vehicles, recognised by the Director of Autovaza on the engineering of Sergei Amanov, without a moment of a breakdown in this segment...
The development of the Russian electricity market other than the railway vehicles (the electrical vehicles sold in Russia, the average double-value comparison with internal combustion engines) prevents the indevelopment of the loading infrastructure (purchase units), anxious by the Sergey Celikov gender of the Autostate.
Due to the expensive and low rates of reducing the self-dependence of the electric vehicle in the next 3-4 years, the Russian market remains a low segment, predicted by the main editor of "Autor" Michael Travelski, Celikov agrees with it.
On the contrary, autoproducers say that some electrical models are near to the value of normals.
The Russian electrical car market has good prospects, mainly to incorporate consumer confidence that “electromobility” is real; that, in particular, will contribute to all new charge stations, emphasized the President of the BMW Group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects will be implemented, for example, by Rosseti's gossip; there are several stations in Moscow, and there will be about 80 more.
In fact, negotiations on the construction of a network are conducted with other regions.
According to the Director of the Department of Rossets, Vladimir Sofien believes in the electrical car market and is ready to build fuels throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for the charge of different brands.
Furthermore, Rossets, as a network company, have no right to sell electricity, is designed to do so with regard to the charge of electric vehicles.
Pankov considers the most effective measure for the establishment of the electric car market in Russia.
The zero rate will take effect until the end of 2014, the possibility of prolonging it, the extension of the leisure list.
The substitute of the transport tax on environmental (the idea is discussed and related to all vehicles) would also support the market, but not as sensitive as the preferentials were tagged, the Pankov considers.
Transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, in contrast with Norway, where tax reduction has led to a dramatic increase in sales of electrical vehicles, now 12 per cent of the market.
Russia also requires incentives for the owners, such as free parking in the center of the city (as already done in Moscow), sure Pankov, or the possibility of moving electrical vehicles on the tracks that are not yet available in Russia.
Private plane crashed in Colorado
One-motor plane Piper PA-46 crashed in the United States of Colorado.
Three of the five people who were in it died are transmitted by ITAR-TASS.
The survivors were delivered to the hospital.
The accident occurred several kilometers from the landing bar of Denver Airport.
The causes of tragedy are now set.
In the Donetsk area, they are dealing with prisoners of the Donbass battalion.
Carriers were surrounded under Iloway.
They were dedicated by their own commanders, and dozens of forces were killed under fire.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation was in the south-east of Ukraine would not go to war.
108 prisoners can be called lucky.
The carriers from the Donbass battalion remained alive after the "meat" in which they were caught under Ilowaiian.
In the army of the Donetsk People's Republic, the warriors spent several days, in fact abandoned by their commanders and authorities of Ukraine.
When the headquarters reported that the ring could be out of the seemingly provided corridor, the column moved.
But literally, a few minutes from all sides, the bullets and the bullets were bullets.
"When I was given, we had a corridor, we were allowed to go out," said the deputy commander of the battalion called "Lermonts".
And when we went down to the bottom between the Multipolis and the Red Settlement, the crossfire started from the anti-tank controlled missiles, from the "cooks" granatometers of 30 mm, automatic BMD weapons.
I had four cars ahead and three behind, and there were only two cars left.
The officer with the calling "Lermonts" says that almost immediately at least 60 people were killed, dozens were wounded, many died afterwards.
The survivors are now medically assisted by those whom they came to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that so-called terrorists are treating them well, giving food, medication.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and condemned their death to return.
We were just betrayed, they said.
The colon, the whole battalion to be destroyed.
In the Donbass battalion, as many of his companions, Alexei was volunteering, since the Ukrainian news was telling about the beliefs that separatists seemed to be committed in the southeast.
Alexei's already seen a different picture here.
His mother in Lugansk was killed, not anyone but Ukrainian troops.
A friend called me, told me there was a minometers shooting, that it was probably Ukrainian armed forces, said one of the soldiers, Alexei.
I wanted to leave the battalion after that.
We were not released from Iloways, they said we were in the ring.
I've already agreed with the commander, and the report has already been written about leaving.
We were immediately taken from the Zurahovo congregations to Ilowaysk.
According to the prisoners, a man 300-350 was stuck in the cotle under Iloway.
Now some survivors recognize that if time could be reinstated, they would not have entered the battalion for nothing.
All prisoners were transferred to the LDCs.
Everyone is being verified for military crimes.

Twitter tried to become more interesting for new users
The Twitter Twitter service has changed the user registration process to quickly engage new participants in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their microblogs.
The new Twitter users will now be reviewed during the registration of a large number of accounts recommended by the accounts service to make their reading circle immediately.
Recommendations are made on the basis of the interests listed in the registration.
Twitter, however, automatically sets a subscriber for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to take off his own slippers in order not to read those who are not interested.
If the users of the microbial service have seen only the avatars of recommended users before, Twitter is now making a model of one of the popular blogers Twitters to help make an impression on the person.
This is the greatest change in the Twitter registration page in the last three years.
Twitter has recently been working on the modernization of the service.
Such activities are mainly linked to the continuing attempts of the service to achieve inadequateness.
In 2014, the microbial service was facing a slow increase in the user base and the decline of readers' activities.
The company now desperately needs a greater number of loyal consumers, which would, once again, remain for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising.

The programme will address all cars over six years of age.
The amount of compensation will amount from 40,000 for a car to 350 thousand rubles per car.
In Russia, such a programme of use of vehicles has already been implemented.
The main distinction of the current project, explained the Minister, is that it is now intended not only to retrieve cars for subsequent discounts, but also to make a new receipt of the age of more than six years of age of the car, with the receipt of the older at the Tread-in dealer, the Interfax transmits.
For the previous federal programme of utilization, from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011, more than 16 billion rubles were spent.
It resulted in the production of light vehicles in 2010, about 1.2 million (as plus 101.4 per cent by 2009).
Creator Coming Out Simulator will play a game about modern journalism
The gamma designer Nikki Case, known as Coming Out Simulator, decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He told about his project at the kill Screen interview.
Case started working on the game a few weeks ago, but it was only now widely known.
The source of inspiration for the game was events in Ferguson, where protests were now initiated after the police killed an unarmed black adolescent.
The focus of the project, which has not yet been named, will be how the information lighting of the stories affects their consequences.
The hero of the game, a civil journalist, will need to photograph what is happening in areas where conflicts between the police and the population.
The hero may take a different picture of what is going to happen, which will affect the course of events.
If he takes off the scene so that the police will look like heroes, and the protesting gangsters, the police will start to treat it better and let go where the ordinary person can't go.
If it highlights events otherwise, its photographs can turn peaceful protests into a great rebellion.
The scores in the game will need to be collected by the hero Twitter, in which new subscribers will appear if the photographs set out there will be popular.
The game has no name yet.
The exit date and the platforms on which it appear are unknown.
Case, however, published a picture demonstrating how the event could change depending on how it was taken and processed.
In the Kill Screen Case interview, he explained that he had been considering the concept of this game for a long time, but he was beginning to want to devote it not to the protests in the United States, but to the events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started gathering materials for the game, he realized that he lacked knowledge and skills to light the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media highlighting the events in Ferguson, he decided to play on the motives of what happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who produces browsing games.
The most known project was the Coming Out Simulator in 2014.
This game describes the events of Case’s biography, devoted to how a bisexual adolescent is trying to tell homophobic parents about his relationship.

“In Moscow, of course, the statements of the head of the Ukrainian Military Department, Valerie Heletheus, who claimed that “the completion of the Eastern Liberation of Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, the loss of “dozens of thousands” would be calculated.

He stated, however, that the "release operation of the Eastern Ukraine" was completed.

The army controls the new Thailand Government
General Praut (right) appointed the Wongsuvan Government Minister for Defence (left)
The military ruler and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Praut Chan-Oca, announced the composition of the new office of the ministers of the country, in which more than three posts are resigned by the generals or generals.
The military has received key posts: defence ministers, finances, foreign affairs and trade.
On Monday, Priut Chan-Ocha was approved as Prime Minister following the official approval of King Thailand of the appointment of the Head of the Interim Military Government to the post.
The 60-year-old military who took power in the country as a result of the 22 May inflict, was the only candidate for the Prime Ministership.
It was elected by the Prime Minister at the parliamentary meeting.
Previously, the army appointed parliamentary representatives.
According to Praut Chan-Ocha, the reverse was the only way to maintain stability.
He had before six months of demonstrations, during which the protestants required resignation from the Government of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat.
Chan-Oca officially will be a temporary prime minister, since the military planned to make universal elections at the end of 2015.
However, there are fears that the military are trying to strengthen their power in the country.
The military came to the authorities on 22 May
The full paralysis of civil authorities.
The leaders of the main political parties were temporaryly arrested.
As soon as the military authorities arrived, they arrested the country's leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglik Chinawat.
Some journalists and public workers were also detained.
The current political crisis is departed by roots in 2006, when the army resided from the Prime Minister of Brother Yinglik Chinawat Taxina.
Both of them enjoy the popularity of rural populations, especially in the northern parts of the country, which has made them successful in the elections.
However, many representatives of the mid-class and capital elite have entered an anti-governmental movement, which has almost paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one even said that the midian salad would be better, I didn't promise you that, a waitress from Palm's new brassary.
It must be formally admitted that it is true, but the mind and stomach remain inclined.
Because everyone knows a long time ago, we say "Belgia" -- we mean midia, we say "midia" -- that means "Belgia".
Restaurants like to say deeply that the success of the establishment depends on three factors: the location, location and again.
There are places that are not to be good, or even good, but some unfortunate.
In fact, when I sat behind Palm's table, I remembered that there was a Café "Gradock" (in the same television), then "Odessa-mama" and also a restaurant "Bohole" and a beer friendship."
Now it's beer again, but it's not nostalgic, it's Belgian.
Only the top of the iceberg is placed above the ground: bar standing and a couple of tables, all the rest of the space is deprived of even the sunlight.
But it's fun in the child's room: red, yellow, and green walls, variety of chairs, instead of windows, TVs where girls sail.
The Belgian institutions in Petersburg have long been not new, so compare with something.
There are eight types of fuel beer (260-300 rubles per 0.5 l) and a countless number of bottles (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive waiter has a fun presentation of the menu, telling that "midias are the finest big seeds" and it should be noted that, despite the individual deficiencies, the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected to be content, but often very unexpected.
Well, for example, it is suggested that a meat roll with a vallonic black slide (280 rubles) is actually a crush that is so thin that the pergament paper compared to it will seem ugly to be thick.
You can only feel some taste if you're shaving the half-catches together.
The salads are even worse.
The classical league (260) would be the right thing to recognise the crime against the Belgian people: some scary iceberg, opened once long ago, the fried Kenyan beans, the bacon chips, plus a marine bowl.
You don't want to meet anyone with such a bed salad!
The composition of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was not positive.
If the unsuspected quarters of cherry tomatoes or burned champions could still be closed, why the midians looked like they were able to freeze and dissolve them in their lives several times!
Because I already know, there are all the normal white-sea midians here!
They are given in the sauce of your choice (490-560 rubles per 0.5 kg).
The sausages of half dozens, the one of the white wine, the seldereum and the carrots, were unfair.
There are vegetables, and there is no smell of wine, and it remains a mystery.
But they're good to the midian fry with a homemaine.
The chicken waters here aren't a flavor that is so thick that, depending on the mood, you can decide, first or second meal before you, but just a nice liquor juice.
It was stated that the rabbit cooked in a beer sauce, and there was nothing to say about rosmarin.
The situation was diameterally contrary: rosmarin was silent.
The impression was that the rabbit had been feeded exclusively with rosmarin clusters from which the meat gained such an unusual smell.
But the rabbit was administered to the foot -- no, it was just a good crush in a caramelized cream.
The wafles in Palm are offered not only sweet but also fine - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The clone sauce was excessively watery, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager who came to the table was very informally interested in the mealed impressions.
So you should come again.
The dollar rate rose to the IMMB above 37 rubles on news about new sanctions for Russia.
It's a new historic record.
The dollar by calculating " tomorrow" by 10:29 MSC rose by 26.9 copies and was 37.02 rubles, the euro was raised by 30 copies - to 48.73 rubles, the data of the Moscow Bank.
The bivaluate basket rose by 28 coins to the level of previous closing and cost 42.28 rubbers.
At the time of the Crime event, the dollar reached the maximum of 19 February 2009, at which it cost 36.43 rubles, and on 3 March 2014 it was already 37.005 rubles.
At the night of 29 August, the White House reported that the President of the United States Barak Obama and the Chancellor of Germany, Angel Merkel, discussed the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the rubber is a long-term nature, both in a couple of euros and a couple of dollars.
The long-term projection suggested that, " said Senior Alpari analyst Anna Bodrov.
Anything related to Ukraine will be reflected in courses anyway.
As long as this continues, investors will respond.
The rumors about the invasion of troops have not been confirmed today, but the market has been very emotional.
All the discussions that he was sustained to such news were overcrowded yesterday.
Week, according to the professional forecasts, closes around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 bucks per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, policies, sanctions, gas transit problem through Ukraine -- all these are the sounds of one chain.
Inflation is also forecasted: the current prices for the autumn will be added between 5 and 10 per cent.
In addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will soon end, and some vacuum will come while the networks are reoriented to other suppliers.
"Dollar came to the 37 ruble mark, passed it and returned, and there was no strong history," commented the chief of the Market Analysis Division "Opening Broker" Constantine Bushuev.
They will still see if the promised sanctions will be introduced on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
Ruble, he said, was sharply weakened after the completion of the tax season, then broadcasting the news on Ukraine, while the CB last week stated that by the end of the year, it was fully moved to the swimming course and denied any currency interventions.
If you look at the daily hesitation, it was nothing different from the previous in this month, the 37 rubles marked all, continues the analyst.
Well, there's nothing powerful about the turning plan.
Interrupting times for the currency market were, remind me, when, at the end of January, the increase in currency demand and the third March, when the CB reloaded the recorded amount of currency.
The UFS IC also see the positive side of the weakening of the rubber.
First of all, it is an increase in the income part of the export transactions and the improvement of the competitiveness of domestic producers through import sales, said UFS Analyst Alexei Kozlov.
The travel of import goods and services may be negative.
The Russian currency collusion has significantly reduced the attraction of investment in the Russian economy, provoked the increase of inflation pressure, and resulted in the increase of money borrowing, which, in turn, hampers the development of the country's economy.
In terms of the stock market, the devaluation of the rubber is a few mitigation of the prices of shares expressed in the rubles.
For example, the IMMB Index decreased by 1.67 per cent during the Thursday trade, and the RTS Index lost 3.27 per cent.
Such a significant difference in the relative level of index reduction is due to a decrease in the rubber over a day by more than 1,5 per cent.
The weakening of the rubber is emotional and caused by a mass desire to buy a currency.
Practice indicates that emotions are gradually offset, while the rubber ratios partially or fully rebuild the lost positions.
"We believe we will soon be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar," said Alexei Kozlov.
Genetic violations are often misdiagnosed
The British reported that she spent many years thinking that she would die after the wrong diagnosis.
Karen Rogers spent most of her teenage age thinking that she had only been living for a few years after diagnosed another disease.
In fact, she had Charko-Mari-Tuta (SMT) disease, a group of inheritance violations that cause nerve damage outside her brains and spinals.
The charity CMT UK reported that the wrong diagnosis was a frequent problem among people with SMT, because it was so little known about this condition.
Approximately 23,000 people in Britain are supposed to have SMT, which may cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, uncertain walk, and stiff fingers.
Patients may feel inferior or pain, and the condition is not healed and progressed, which means that symptoms are increasing with time.
When Rogers was 13 years old, she thought she was suffering from the Friedreych attack (AF) -- a state for which the projection was very bad.
Rogers thought she'd be attached to the wheelchair until she was 18 and died before she was 30.
The mother of two children, who are now 51, said, "I knew as a child that I couldn't do what others could do.
I fell down every day, and I had more time for it.
I've never been able to ride films or skateboards with other children, and I've been a lot of mess at school because I've been walking and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13 years old, after a few operations, to release the ahillous drought and fix her feet, she looked into the medical map when her doctor left the room and said that she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I put my nose where I shouldn't, and that's why I didn't tell anyone, but I came home, found information about this situation in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received information in reply, I was shocked and suffered the most terrible panic as possible.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I was 25, and that I would gradually lose all my ability in this interval.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funerals.
She said that when she was 17 years old, she realized that her ability to walk was not as deteriorating as she thought, and asked her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you'd have been in the wheelchair."
I think you have something that's a much smaller threat to life.
After several genetic surveys, she found SMT.
"When he explained what the SMT was, I thought I pulled out a happy ticket," she said.
The SMT charity organization of Great Britain announced a month of information on the SMT to try to draw attention to this disease.
Tax burden on businesses of the Washington Zone grows when the economy is restored
The restoration economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
The taxpayment accounts at the state and local level for companies throughout the country have increased moderately last year when the recovery of the economy has increased, according to the new study published last week, and the company in the Washington Zone is not an exception.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia totally paid $27.6 billion to execute the state and locally in the financial 2013, by 3.8 per cent more than $26.6 billion gathered for 2012.
The tax burden on the state and local business last year increased by 4.3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent earlier, and this was the third year of growth following each other, when the accounts decreased in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased faster, 4.3 per cent than local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to the research carried out by the company providing professional services, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Centre, the tax-based group.
More than half of the tax income in the district, 56 per cent, are taxed to entrepreneurs, while 36 per cent of Meriland's tax income is in business.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, contributes to the lowest tax income, proportionally from entrepreneurs.
A large increase in tax income is due to a return to the remaining cost of real estate, researchers say that it raised taxes by 3.7 per cent in this year after three years in order to increase less than 1 per cent.
While the large share of these incomes is in large states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same is happening in the Washington zone.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia totally paid $10 billion taxes for state and local property last year by $9,6 billion more than 4.2 per cent in 2012, compared to the previous year.
However, the reimbursement of real estate does not have any similar impact on the growth of tax income at the state and local level in Maryland, where taxes on real estate are barely exceeding one fifth tax accounts of companies.
Virginia and the Colombian District are paying about half the tax accounts on the state and locally in the form of real estate taxes.
"What's going on in Maryland is that the largest part of their real estate, especially the tax base around the County of Colombia, belongs either to the Government or to non-commercial organizations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the State Tax Centre.
Thus, Maryland has much more to rely on income taxes, for example, to pay the same services in other states.
The recent increase in tax income from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the recovery of the real estate market.
The revenue of entrepreneurs also appears to be corrected, according to these data.
Companies in the region declared a corporate income tax at the state level of $2.3 billion per $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland gathered a billion corporate income taxes, mostly in the region.
Although trends are directed in one direction, the tax burden of local entrepreneurs does not increase with the same speed in all three areas.
The level of growth in the Colombian County was at the same level as the country ' s average, 4.3 per cent, while Maryland ' s growth was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
Only in Virginia, tax revenues were raised below the average of 4.1 per cent.
In Virginia, the lowest corporate income tax from three jurisdictions (each of which is the same corporate rate) was equal to 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate was 8.25 per cent, while it was relatively high in the area of 9.975 per cent.
Such a study of the United States Chamber earlier this year showed that in Virginia there were lower taxes for state and local entrepreneurs and, in general, a more favourable climate on business taxes than in Maryland.
The district was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia has a competitive pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has recently signed a legislative act that reduces the corporate rate from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent this year, as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 per cent next year.
If the State continues to achieve tax income goals in the next year, this law could make the income tax rate for entrepreneurs even up to 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, a small business in the Washington Zone seems to feel better and thus pay more taxes at the state and local level, according to a recent study.
Entrepreneurs' taxes paid in the form of individual income tax by small business owners are a transitional structure that builds most small companies in the Colombia County, Maryland and Virginia by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, with much higher growth rates than taxes for entrepreneurs.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in business taxes across the country would probably continue this year, with taxes from trafficking in governments of the state and local governments, which increased by 6.2 per cent for the first three blocks of 2014, compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington Zone may retire, as the reduction of federal costs affects the labour market in the region.
The Bronze Age of the Russian Judo
The World Championship for Judo brought two silver and seven bronze prizes to Russia.
According to this indicator, the Russians were only departed by the main favorite of the Japann collective competition.
The tournament in Chelabinsk launched on Monday, and the first day brought a silver medal to the Russian team.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, speaking in a category of up to 60 pounds.
In the same final fight against Boldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the opposition was only one comment received by the Russian.
The second day of the tournament became the most successful one for Russia’s assembly -- three medals were conquered on Tuesday.
In male competitions in the category of up to 66 pounds of silver, Michael Pulaev and Kamalu Han-Magomedov bronze.
In the final battle, the Russians departed from the world champion of 2011 and 2013, the Japanese Masasi Ebinume.
Han-Magomedes, at the fourth-final stage of the loser of the country, victorially walked into a comforting tournament and became a bronze prize owner.
In the female tournament of the categories up to 52 pounds, Natalia Kuzjutin had also reached the third step of the recruitment.
In the semi-final, she lost the current world champion of Milynda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who was on the flag of the International Federation of Judo and has successfully protected the title.
In the dispute for the Bronze of Kuzutin, Ma Inan from China, but after the end of the tournament, she admitted that the third place was not what she was expecting.
Again, the russian road to the gold became the Kelmendi, who conquered Kuzutin earlier in the final of the European Championship.
On the third day of the Chelabinian tournament bronze in the rose collection, Musa Moshkov was put in a category of up to 73 pounds.
In the quarterfinal, his offender was the former representative of Moldova, Victor Scovorts, now speaking for the OAE team.
However, then the Russian won two fights and became the owner of the reward.
Moshkov was a home champion with a golostop trauma that he planned to heal soon, so he would take a break in competitions.
As for the ex-moldovanin Skvartzov, he and he reached the bronze medal on this tournament.
Interestingly, the other member of the OAE, Ivan Remarenko, who accepted sports citizenship, completed the bronze in a category of up to 100 pounds.
The fourth day of CM-2014 also brought a bronze to the Russians, which Ivan Nifont conquered in a category of up to 81 kg.
In a severe struggle for the small final, he defeated French Alan Schmidt by comments.
On Friday, three awards were played at the tournament, but the Russians were limited to one bronze in the male tournament to 90 pounds.
Its owner was Cyril Questions, and the medal was guaranteed to be a contest for the comforting final of Cyril Denisov.
However, there was no struggle: the rival of the question was unable to get on the tattoo because of the trauma.
The men's bronze was conquered by the masters and on the sixth day of competition, was placed in a gathering renata Saidov, who spoke in a category of over 100 pounds.
In a comforting final, he won a pure victory over the Brazilian David Moura.
This was the end of the individual part of the world's primary.
On the last day of the Chelabinian tournament, Sunday, the world championships played.
Both Russian assemblies -- both male and female -- were one of the primary awards, but, as in individual competitions, the representatives of the beautiful sex had not been lucky -- they had not arrived to the medal.
The Russian judoists conquered a command silver.
In a decisive contrast, they departed the main favorites of competition to the Japanian team in persistent combating accounts 2-3.
The Russian collection led 2-0 after the pure victory of Han-Magomedov and the volunteer - Dennis Jarcev (weight to 73 kg).
However, in the more difficult categories, the Japanese rivals were unable to handle Murat Habakirov (81), Magomed Magomedes (90) and Aslan Cambius (100).
The same scenario was developed by a bronze match in a female tournament where the Russian gathering, with 2-0, declined to Japanese - 2-3.
The Russian President Vladimir Putin attended team competitions in Chelabinsk, who congratulated the men's silver meeting after the end of the tournament.
"The second place is very honourable, but I mean, it was obvious that you could be champions," said Putin, whom the words of RIA "News."
To lose the Japanese, to the masters of judo, there's nothing dark here.
But I'm sure you can win from them.
The Russian Congregation at the World's Home Championship was much better than a year ago at the Rio de Janeiro competition.
The Russian team then had only three medals, one silver and two bronzes.
The current tournament was passed by the Olympic Champions of Arsen Galstian and Mansur Isaius.
We're all, of course, big masters.
Yeah, you want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person enters the olympic cycle in eight of the strongest, he's the potential winner of the Olympics.
At the same time, sports as judo," the RF Minister of Sports, Vitalij Mutko, which is a press service of the championship, concluded at the end of the tournament.
The collective Japan was expected to be the best in Chelabinsk, conquering 11 different medals of dignity, five of which were golden.
The next world championship will take place in Astan in the summer of the future year.
Other materials, news and statistics are available on the summer sports page.
Joan Rivers' family hopes for the best.
Joan Rivers is unconscious of her arrival to the hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian actress will be relieved from the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in the statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had a heart stop at the Upper East Side Clinic, Yorkville Endoscope, reported sources.
The doctors intentionally keep her under the injury and under strict observation until they are satisfied with her condition that remains " difficult".
The response was wide, including numerous support on the Internet from Donald Tramp, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
Everyone will be able to make kings.
In sale, the Royal Blood debut album of the Royal Blood Group, the new hope of the British rock, which was produced by rock duets from clubs directly to stadiums.
Duet Royal Blood is on the stage all year, but already has a nomination for the BBC musical prize, a warming tour at the Arctic Monkeys and visits the New York concert from Jimmy Paige itself.
Their debutable one-name album received 100,000 procurements in a few months before the relief, and the contract for the release is in the Major Lejbla Warner Music portfolio.
Given the current grief situation on the music market, the situation is not a new Lana Del Ray or a fresh-looking representative of the R'n'B, and the duet of the bull-like British who played with that level of loudness and intensity, which was the last time in fashion a few decades ago.
In general, the first album rates were particularly high and have already been justified.
Duett did not take a name that could have been touched before, except that the desperate hair metalists, and the blood of the kings who seem to have in their veins, is understandable.
This is, of course, the heroes of the past level of Led Zeppelin: as a large quarter, the Royal Blood aims to squeeze the persistent blood of the British rock by bringing it to a new height.
Prognose the success of the company is probably early, but there is something to be claimed.
A dozen songs incorporated in thirty and a few minutes are not as much as a demonstration of the phenomenon of composer's gifts as a reliable and powerful declaration of intentions.
Some of the dignity of individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: let's say, the pilot single "Out of the Black" is characterized by not a melodic line, but a drum party.
The musicians are joking to say that it's even easier to knock it off than sing.
A powerful "Little Monster" and closing the "Better Strangers" composition with a Shakespeare quote in the title.
The truth is, however, that each of these songs will sound great at a heavy rock party, but when they are played, they are merged into more or less one-born plates.
And it's not necessarily bad, even the opposite.
The force of Royal Blood is that they do not pretend to be new Lennon and McCartney (withstanding to the Motörhead successors), but have produced many rock duets from the ghetto of Indian clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, was created for the stadiums, in a room calculated by less than a few thousand people, is obviously close.
The secret is partially in the scary use of the bass that replaced the guitar in a common form that was created at the beginning of the The White Stripes.
However, it is not only in instruments but also in the very approach to the composition of songs.
The heroes of the zero year were hardly elected outside the postmodernist paradigm, with a huge unwantage to recognise themselves not just as epigons, but by self - creative units.
The Royal Blood sounds so powerful and urgently that this effort is successfully drawing out some secondary and solidness of musical material.
Well, after all, who said that rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON has just confirmed what information reported on Friday morning: Online store and videoproducer and hundreds of other things is buying a Twitch stream-production service for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
This news was not a surprise because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected that YouTube would be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of the Google video service for a good billion seemed fully ready, and this combination seemed natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set the aim of being a stream service of general nature, a version of the real time of YouTube.
Instead, he quickly became a platform where the players translated their inside games; "YouTube for real time," said Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a genre of videos in which the all-knowledges give (usually old) the processing games, like the "The Mysterious Theatre", are already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube acquires Twitch was met without special interest, a classic example of a rooted technological company buying a potential competitor.
This is a secret why the YouTube deal failed, given that it was ready to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have right now is a statement from the Executive Director Twitch Emmett Shir: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us reach them faster."
Another secret, honestly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobs like me, who claim that they're better at sport than watching it, are difficult to understand the attraction of watching games instead of taking a joystical hand.
One thing is to look through a friend's shoulder at 3:00 a.m. when she crawls through the Resident Evil, and the other thing is to watch some stranger gets 20 shots in the head in order to call of Duty.
All the games you could look at right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are counted on one person, so watching them without self-controlling the angle, may be a prescription of headache worth Do It Right.
I agree that the rapid passages in which the Rogers of the Bennisters of our e-century end all the games in the record time are entertaining.
But if it's not about a game or a humor virtue, it's unlikely that its Twitch channel will be at all interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, which is the fourth largest source of the Internet.
How exactly will Amazon earn this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch will turn to Amazon Instant Video as well as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
However, Twitch has what any company would be pleased to receive: the crowds of young men dreaming about.
As chapter Twitch Shir, Amazon and Twitch said, "both believe in the future games" and this channel does not give signs of indulgence, even - oh - as a visible sport.
Over 330 people, including 186 children, died in 2004.
Over 800 people were wounded.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
The survivors were spoken, almost all the students, with the parents of the dead, with the watcher of the cemetery, the city of Angel - Ramon Caspolatt, head of the Committee of the Susana Mother Dudiev, who participated in the Special Operations by the ICS Officer, told the correspondent of the Department of the Society of Elizabeth Antonov, who worked on the special project.
As soon as they returned to Moscow, they met with Aslambek Aslahan, who was 10 years ago the President's adviser for North Cavacaux and had negotiations with terrorists, as well as with the Officer of the FSB of Russia, Viceslav Bočarov.
What was particularly excited during the work on this subject is that in Beslan there was like there was no 10 years.
This topic is very painful for all who have anything to do with it, people who hardly agree to say what happened.
The impression of the journey is very difficult.
But we can't forget Beslan, and I hope we have done our job," Antonova said.
The special project was prepared by a holding study of Rambler & Co, which has been working in the company since the spring of this year.
The previous special projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15th year of the residence of Vladimir Putin.
UNDR launched a small-range missile
North Korea launched a small distance missile into the Japanese sea aquatorium, reports Renhap.
The launch was launched at about 10.30 a.m. from the province of Chagando, located on the border of North Korea and China.
Apparently, the missile fell to the Japanese Sea, flying about 220 km, said in the United Committee of Heads of South Korea.
Deputies proposed acceleration of the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
In the case of success of the initiative, Russian data will not be stored on abroad servers from 1 January 2015
The State had draft law to translate the date of entry into force of the already adopted Russian Personal Data Act from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is located in the base of the legislative activities of the Lower Chamber.
Her authors were deputated by the State of Vadem Dengin, Jaroslav Neilov (LDPR), Eugene Fedorov, Vladimir Parahin and Alexander Eustenko (CPRF).
Such a change, in the opinion of the authors of the initiative, would contribute to the more rapid and effective security of RF citizens ' rights to the preservation of personal data and to the secrecy of the communications in the information and telecommunications networks.
The Law, which hastens by parliamentarians, compels to keep personal data of Russians processed online in the RF territory.
It also provides mandatory recording, systematicization, accumulation, storage, clarifying and extracting personal data of RF citizens in the databases located in Russia, as well as indicating the location of such databases.
Furthermore, the law gives the Roscomnard the right to limit access to information processed by the violation of the PF legislation in the field of personal data.
The Law also proposes the establishment of so-called " black lists " of violent sites - the automated information system " The Registry of Personal Data Violants".
This law was adopted by the Lord in the summer.
The draft law was made by Andrew Lugová and Vadim Dengin from LDPR and Alexander Justenko from CPRF.
Dengin and Yušenko are also one of the authors of the current draft law on the date of entry into force of the law already adopted.
Those who don't have centres in RF will have to pay for rent.
In comment on the draft law introduced today to the State of the First Heads of the Think Committee on Information Policy, Leonid Levin stated that he did not see the problem of transferring the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
He said that those companies who will not have their own personal data stores in the RF territory will be able to rent them, for example, in Rostelecom, which repeatedly said that they were willing to provide their servers to rent and already provide their servers with the Mail Group, with Western companies that have already provided their servers today.
"There are also several independent centres ready to cooperate in this area," he added.
"If companies decide to implement the law and continue working in the RF territory, there is no problem - they will receive technological opportunities to place," Levin said.
Conflict Act
As soon as the draft law was published, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed its fear that, in the event of adoption of the draft law, the Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, it is about services for online aircraft and hotels.
According to the Association, “the draft law deprives the individuals of the Russian Federation ' s nationals of the right to order their own data imperially, determining that their recording, systematization, etc. should be provided only in the databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be the establishment of a user information mechanism where the recording is carried out, the systematicization of its personal data.
In that case, it will be able to choose which territory the actions will be carried out.
The adoption of such legislation on "localization " of personal data in other countries has led to the departure of global services and significant economic losses.

Contributors have transmitted more than 400 prisoners to Ukrainian military
The New-Russian Army claims that Ukrainian Su-27 was beaten and accused the opponent of violating the ceasefire agreement
At 10:00, 1 September, the colleagues transferred 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of which were wounded and 35 dead soldiers.
The representative of the Press Service of the New Rouss Army informed Interfax.
He added that “the forces of the CFO in the area of the Mereška population have been struck by the Su-27 plane that violated the ceasefire agreement”.
According to the interviewer of the agency, the Ukrainian party in the Lugan Airport, in the artillery of the Luganese Airport, applied prohibited by international conventions munitions.
The press service representative noted that two UK helicopters at one of the field airports had been damaged over the night, as well as the destruction of two armored spotters and two ammunition warehouses.
"The losses in the alive force of the opponent -- up to a hundred people killed and wounded, were detained by 13 people," the headquarters summarized.
Interfax has no confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formation of “national republics” of Donbass declared the transfer of the Ukrainian party in compliance with the ceasefire regime of 223 prisoners and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine.
At the same time, at the night, the LDC army, according to the New Rouss Army, "presented the attempt of the Nazi Guards to violate previous agreements from the area of the environment with a severe technique."
At that time, the colleagues reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs, six tanks and disarmament of 198 troops.
According to the headquarters, the total loss of the opponent in all directions (Doncec, Lugansk, Mariopolski) was five tanks, eight armed vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded
At the end of last week, the large group of Ukrainian troops had been surrounded by mutuals in Ilowaisk in the Donetsk region.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, requested the leadership of the “national republics” to release Ukrainian troops from the environment.
The LDC agreed to do so provided that weapons and ammunition were transferred.
The first dozens of soldiers began to leave surrounded settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander who was surrounded by the battalion of the Ukrainian Territorial Defence Donbass Semenchenko, 14 others left the Sunday night.
In his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that Ukrainian wounded are “in captivity of 137 police 32 RF divisions and 9 tank brigade” where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the MID and the Ministry of Russia objected to the reports of Ukraine's military and NATO on the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
MID RF: Russia will take responsive measures in the event of the introduction of new sanctions
Russia leaves the right to take response measures to protect its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions, the MID RF reported.
The Russian External Diplomatic Authority report states that the European Council ' s " conclusions " of 30 August demonstrated the inability of EU Member States to overcome the inertia of unreasonable support by their cyne authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in the east of Ukraine, based on " absolutely unproven allegations of the presence of the Russian armed forces in the territory of the country," the branch website states.
MID RF regrets that Eurosovet, in spite of the interests of its Member States, has been influenced by countries interested in strengthening the confrontation with Russia.
Members of the EuroSovet should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine, as well as to provide conditions for a full " dialogue between counterparts", the emphasizes the agency.
The office also notes that there are no objectives to assess the humanitarian situation in Donbass, where the full humanitarian disaster has been deployed and the number of victims of the peaceful population is increasing.
Recall that, during the next seventh session of the European Union, concrete proposals for sanctions against RF are planned.
The EU representatives are working closely with American officials.
They are expected to correlate the measures initiated for the period of action and the degree of rigidity.
The new sanctions of the European Union may affect energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government also announced the enlargement of sanctions against Russia in the field of defence, finances and oil industry.
Smart ways to save in university books
While the cost of university books for many students exceeds $1,000 per year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon go to the second class, has developed a trickly way to reduce costs.
He developed a system of ways to collect books from senior classmates, offering them nominal compensation for their sale to be delayed.
"My mathematical analysis book, which usually cost $80, I got a semester for $10 and a chick-fil-A cookie," said Schroeder, 19, who is studying at the Covenant of College in Georgia.
The required literature for the past semester would cost $430, he said.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, the average student spends more than $1200 per year on books and trainings, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing Internet stores and creative ideas like Schroeder's system.
The book sales is increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester and often cost significantly much cheaper than their purchase.
The company Orbo Incorporated, which belongs to more than 250 university book stores, reported that the volume of books had increased twice since 2011.
Industries studies show that about a quarter of books in university book stores during the last spring semester were sold, said Vice-President Nibo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the books are acquired in university bookshops, according to the Professional Association of University shops.
Here is the introduction course on best ways to make a profitable deal.
Shopping in the Internet store
Sometimes, if you get online, the price for a new book can be one third of what you see in the university bookshop.
The ninth issue of "Mathematical Analysis" of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is approximately $290, but a new copy can be acquired for $239,99 on the Chegg.com website, which is specialized for the sale of books.
Shopping of the receipt
If you're not opposed to other people's marks or damages, the books used are a good option.
The Mathematical Analysis is sold for $93.49 in a supported form at Chegg.com.
Matt Caseday, 25, a fourth course student at the University of Brigham Yang, said that he paid for Amazon.com 42 cents for a supplied copy of the "Strategic decisions in the Media: Understanding the Business Part of the Advertising Business".
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Bracey, Director of College without Walls at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, invites students to clarify their professors whether they can use previous publications.
Sometimes updates are not important for classes.
In such cases, old publications can often be found for a very small share of the cost of the latest edition.
In addition to the Chagg and Amazon sites, Half.com, belonging to the eBay Inc., is a popular alternative for the purchase of receiving books.
Project
If you are treating them well enough, you will not forget to bring them back, and you will not want to leave them after the course is complete.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of the new book.
For example, one student was able to take the Mathematical Analysis project for a semester for about $20.
Determine the rules of the store where you take books, including any fines that can be written to you for labels, emphasizes and damages.
If you take the book for a sale, remember that if you don't return the book, fines can even exceed the value of a new copy.
E-books
Electronic books instead of traditional books are another option.
Sometimes such books take their own acquisition by acquiring an electronic license for a certain period, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Mathematical Analysis" project on the Chegg.com website will cost approximately $61 for six months.
Bracey says that students studying literature can often find the most profitable prices, as many classic works can now be downloaded for free, while literature on natural and engineering science can be very expensive.
Nevertheless, look around.
Joe Golt, 29, who is going to start a Legal School in Pepperdin, recommends use of ISBN to find out the prices of the book, as it guarantees that you are looking for the text you need.
Before making an online order, Golt says, you need to check if the book is actually in the warehouse.
This lesson was difficult for him.
The delivery of the book he obtained was deferred for four weeks, and eventually he paid the full price in the university book store.
Putin stated the full ineffectiveness of the Development Fund of the Far East
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, called at a meeting on the Priority Investment Projects and Territories in the Far East, said the Interfax, that the budget fund for the development of the Long East, established two years ago, was ineffective.
"15 billion rubs remained on deposits," stressed the President.
During the meeting, the head of the State had ordered to accelerate the approval of the list of the emerging development territories in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the establishment of TORs should be introduced to the State of the fall.
The Federal Assembly, noted the President, has not yet approved the list of territories of emerging development in the Far East until 1 July and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin has also formulated the key challenges to ensure the development of the Far East.
Among them, the improvement of the transport availability of the region, the withdrawal of infrastructure restrictions, both on the internal market and for export development.
Furthermore, prerequisites should be made to attract additional investments in the region, as well as to form areas of emerging development, which should be competitive in relation to key ATP business centres, stressed the President.
Recall, earlier, it was reported that OEC could replace the emerging development territory.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy have not been able to save the cassoes
Sylvestra Stallone's "Inconsistant 3" returned less than $30 million from its $90 million budget in the United States, while "The city of sins: the woman for which it is worth killing" returned only $12 million from its 70 million budget.
The Home Video with Cameron Diaz had only $14.6 million on the first weekend, while children's films, such as "How to Purchase Dragon 2" also disappointed with the benefit.
The article of the film criticism Telegraph Robbie Collin indicates that when it comes to children's movies, it may be a bad quality of movies.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year in the history of child films, and called "How to Purchase Dragon 2" a "functional" continuation of the fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at the audience of a few older ages, the problem seems not necessarily to be films itself.
In July, the Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritis of each summer film that had been sold at least 2000 copies between the Memorial Day in May and 20 July, 2013 and this year.
The results that take into account the views of both cinemaists and movie criticists suggest that the fertility of the films this year is like a caliber with last year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that this may be about changing visual habits and increasing popularity of stream services such as Netflix.
The director John Favro, who is currently working on a short-term "The Book of the Jungle" film, said to the Hollywood Reporter web site, "I think the time is changing."
We must admit that and not try to pursue what was before.
In contrast to the current drop in the Hollywood Castle, Netflix's revenue from the current reproduction service reached $1.2 billion, almost double exceeding the last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studies for being too relying on comics franchises, and foretold Hollywood's collapse.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators claim that in its dark prophecies there was a share of truth.
In the summer of 2015, several potential kass hits were expected, including Revengeers: era of Altron, Miñonov and the South Park, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
Producer "H" Simon Kinberg recently called the falling of the cass collections just "cyclic", said Hollywood Reporter, "The next summer will be the most late summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Product sanctions do not frighten the owners of cavcasian and middle Asian food, but the Russian suppliers are a terrible dream for European and Japanese kitchen restaurants.
In general, the publicity still prefers to replace the forbidden import of products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"There is a little salt cock than a bad mozarella," the Italian chef of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio was broken about the quality of cheese offered by the Italian suppliers in exchange for it.
Mozarella and burrat cheese ended up in the restaurant first, and they had a small time of storage.
Parmezan's supplies should be sufficient for a few more months.
What do I do?
Going to Russian?
In 2005, I was on the Dorogomilov market.
Mariano Valerio does such eyes that it is clear that shocking memories still do not let him go.
The meat was on the cars only 30 inches from the floor!
There's cats!
Rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant we'll never buy anything in the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe it's changed right now.
But they gave me a fish test from the Dale East.
That's how she's turned out to be a creep!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many ordinary things for Italy for the Russian producer in the wildlife.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is hanged in the cooling cell for 10 days at 1-2 degrees.
It must depend to be soft to relax the muscles.
I did all this with the local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get this soft meat?"
I said, that's yours, Russian!
Why don't you have anyone to do that?
Five minutes of walking from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" in the kitchen has a stop list that indicates the absence of products: French oysters, seafood.
The chief of the restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" and the Bar "Shooting" Režis Trigel are not so pessimistic as Valerio: the streets of France have already replaced the streets from Tunisia, and instead of the French cheese restaurants will buy Swiss restaurants.
However, the director becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Flower coupon is 200 rubles!
I'm asking, "Why is it so worth it?"
They say, "We have to make money too."
But it should not cost more than 80 rubles!
We're buying the streets from the east, but they live 15 to 20 years, you know how much their vest weighs?
At the price, it's a superdelicate.
The Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources for foreign cooks.
The standard story: "The first three months were all right, then the quality dropped sharply."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot endure stable caliber and quality.
Many European kitchen restaurants don't know what happens when cheese stocks are over.

Sanctions Menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of individual economic measures to ensure Russia ' s security, which are mainly called product sanctions.
The country is prohibited from importing beef, pigs, meat and sub-products from domestic birds, meat delicates, fish, milk, milk, yogurts, made, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
Restaurants have started with suppliers: the prices of products have increased, they need to look for similars from other countries.
The strongest effect of this will be the expensive restaurants from France, Italy, Spain, where the products were placed directly from the "mater" countries.
The community had to rebuild before.
For example, when Rosselhowadsor prohibited the import of Australian beef and a year earlier was an American and Canadian meat.
In exchange, the suppliers provided delivery of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of summer-2014 have been far more serious.
True, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev approved amendments to the Presidential Decree, which are under the prohibition of Atlantic salmon and foul, free milk, seed potatoes, corn, berries and garments for seed.
The Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions can still be mitigated.
At the time, a number of restaurants exists under uncertainty.
According to the East-West company, one of the largest HoReCa suppliers was up to 70 per cent of import products in the premium segment.
"Dear restaurants will have to change menus to what local farmers and other countries produce," said Sergei Mironov, restaurant, owner of the RestConsult Agency.
If the chef's strong, it won't be a problem for him.
Only we have very few cooks, and a new menu can take two or three months.
The Trigel from the Brasserie Bridge is ready for this: you have to give up 10 to 15 per cent of the meal, half of the menu to rework.
In mixed kitchen restaurants are already starting to replace foods, such as steak from marble beefstrogans, said Sergei Mironov.
"The cheese from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheese, cheese from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," stated the representative of the East-West Oxana Globechuk.
Analogies in Russia and Belarus are analogous from the breast products from Europe.
The chicken from the United States can be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus, a salmon and a semga from Norway - slosom, semgoy, whiterusian foil and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits of European production can be compensated by the production of domestic producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
Mironov believes that the budget restaurants will be restructured easier than the premial segment: no gurmans were able to distinguish the Italian mozarel from the Russian.
Although it is difficult to establish a Ginza Project, he believes.
Ginza Project has a few dozen restaurants under different brands and with its menus.
A lot of time will be replaced," said Mironov.
In Ginza, the comments were rejected by referring to the absence of owners in the country.
Café owners of Caucasian and Mediterranean cuisine emphasize that products from former Soviet republics are more smelling than European
But a lot of restaurants whose sanctions are almost not touched.
These include CIS kitchen facilities: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijan.
"There are no expensive foods in the Georgian kitchen," said Hatuna Kolbaya, owner of the Georgian Saperavi restaurant and the cafeteria "You Me!".
All cheese are made for us in Russia, based on many foods is a chicken branch, an exotic green we do not use."
Colbai's houses have not yet been removed from the menus.
Timor Lansky, owner of Chihone N1 restaurants in Uzbek cuisine, is not disturbed by sanctions: it will only have to change lamb into New Zealand.
If Russia gets imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we even win the price, this will be cheaper for us than imports from Europe, he says.
The CNG can be cheaper for cutting, lamb, tomatoes, barbecues, fruits.
In this regard, what is brought from Central Asia is much better than the "plastik" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
Everyone knows about Uzbek tomatoes that they're delicious, sweet.
No one talks like that about Spanish.
After the introduction of sanctions, the representative of Minselvodhoz Uzbekistan, Olymboy Artics, said that he planned to increase the export of fruit products to Russia twice by 2016.
Its intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the introduction of sanctions, Belarus and Kazakhstan declared.
The fastfood restaurants that responded to the Money request also responded quite quietly to sanctions.
The McDonald's press service stated that the location exceeds 85 per cent and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanová, head of the Subway Russia Department of Work, some 80 per cent of the products are purchased in Russia, although temporary complexity with the supply of vegetables and price increases for meat products produced from import raw materials.
In Teremca, sanctional products were not more than 4% at all.
They didn't touch the sanctions and the Walker football.
KFC, Burger King and "Kroska Cartoska" did not respond to the "Money" request, but other market participants claim that the Burger King's location was significantly less than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurants are willing to buy Chile rather than Russian Far East
On his throat
At the time, the restaurants complain that the demand increases even for local products.
The "Grabley" prices grew by average by 10 to 15 per cent, for the Italian Cherry Mio restaurant twice," said Roman Rožnicki restaurant.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the self-dependence of meals will increase by 5 to 10 per cent, acknowledged by Kolbaya.
"East-West" does not deny that, "for example, the white-Russian breast products have travelled 10-15 per cent since August beginning."
"Brazilian suppliers raised pig prices almost twice," complained Sergei Rak, Deputy Director-General Stardogs.
The chickens traveled 35 per cent.
We're looking for prices from China, maybe they'll cold Brazilian heads.
The Stardogs will soon increase the prices by 8 per cent.
Now it's very undesirable to raise prices," says Rac.
Statistics show that the second quarter of 2014 increases in totally 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest indicator since 2010.
Different prices will continue to rise, he admits, but unbelievable how quickly: as long as most restaurants have been reserved with products for the next two months in hope of receiving procurement prices.
But in two months, no one knows.
In front of the mayor of Moscow, there are ten ten ten ten ten ten tens decorated by green and tree.
In the center of the scene, musicians play valse.
This is a Festival of regional products called "There's time to eat."
"We have been going to make a local food celebration for a long time, and here are sanctions, we have hurryed up, organized the festival," said one organizer.
At the scene with Greek cooks, Anastas cooked salad from macarons and home candy, and there was a master class to prepare a bowl with caramelized apples.
All of the Russian products, they assure organizers.
The tents are the exhibition of the Russian people ' s achievements.
Honey from Baskiria, a jelene of Salehard, vegetables from the sulphur "Sowhoza named Lenin", cheese from the rumped Italian, Jay Clouse.
"The salmon for restaurants can be easily replaced by other salmon fish from the Far East," says the owner of the fish store "His people" Philipp Galkin.
We've got kidneys, cats, squirrels, creams, coffins, "corn salmon."
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon because they're wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
He's not even moving.
And you can't keep our fareeast salmons in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace the Italian national mozarel
In his tent, there are shrimps with the Magadan beetle, fever, muxune, midians with Krim, the faree from the Dale East.
Galkin is sure it's time to go to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, the fishing of more than 4 million tons in Russia in 2013 is in Japan, Korea, and even in the United States.
Import of fish in 2013 is about 800,000 tonnes.
The "His People" has been working since 2012, selling fish through the Internet stores, providing sanctions for another half a dozen restaurants, such as "Simple things".
Galkin has now received requests from 15 other restaurants.
The same drought can be made of our fish, he's hot.
We're dark, we've tried different recipes.
We now sell sushi through the Internet store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is cheaper several times, and the delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
Confirming in the Galkin tent, I'm being prepared by the Philadelphia with a keta.
Unlike the rolls with the segment, these must be chewed longer, but the consciousness that this fish is our patriotics gives strength.
There's even rolls from the coat and the sea oak on the "His people" site.
In sushi bars, it is true that the replacement of Norwegian salmon prefers Chile.
Galkin explains this by the cooks of lazy to invent new recipes with fareeeast fish.
"The Russian fish suppliers have not yet been offered to us," explains the owner Killfish Bar Dmitri Euseev.
Approximately the same situation as with other products: Russian producers could take the released nish, but this does not happen.
According to the founder and companion of the LavkaLavka Boris Akimov, imports from Europe and America are now more likely to be replaced by imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are major transnational corporations with strong logistics and large volumes.
They are able to replace the prohibited imports quickly, unlike our farmers.
It is, therefore, that large producers of other countries will win from ban," said Akimov.
However, in the last month, the restaurant has received a more alarming signal than product sanctions.
The three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow were temporaryly suspended as a result of the mass extra-planet checks of Rossenger and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Ekaterinburg.
"We are studying the importance of the claims made to determine the actions needed for the early opening of restaurants for visitors," said "Money" in the McDonald's press service.
No one really understands what's going to happen.
If all is limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, said an anonymous personnel in a restaurant consulting company.
But if they start closing McDonald's all over the country, the script will be different.
EuroProtocol instead of the GIBD question
The casco payments will be obtained without GIBD, so the CB intends to stimulate the implementation of the European Colonel in Russia.
The Russian Bank has developed a draft instruction that, from 1 September this year, the insured carrier would be able to make it without the GIBD.
This is true, it is only the case when the accident was formed by the European circle without the participation of the road police.
Thus, if only two cars were involved in the DTP, there were no physically affected persons, the damage is not exceeding the limit set, and both drivers agreed on the issue of who the guilty of the accident was.
From 2 August, the "Europroproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproprops" will be compensated for 50,000 and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad areas it will be increased to 400,000 rubs.
The point is, often even in a minor injury, in a situation where the DTP can be formed in a European circle, the drivers who had accidents are causing DPS.
Because, if there was a casco policy, the GIDD could not have been reimbursed without a question.
The options provided for in the project of guidance are to remove this obstacle to the implementation of the European circle in Russia.
According to them, the maximum salary on casco in relation to the DTP made without GIDD staff should not be below the limits of the “european circulation”.
However, it cannot be above the limit set out in the Kasco insurance contract.
The idea is definitely useful and theoretically capable of unloading both DPS staff and roads.
But she is probably not going to be admired by carists or insurance.
The latter has already been talking about a serious threat to the increase of fraud, which may lead to the introduction of new rules of payment for casco.
With regard to drivers, it is difficult to imagine what job to be done to overcome the executive Russian conservation.
The driver will in most cases wait for an inspector for a small accident, because it is more reliable.
And not even known what would be easier to beat frauds or convince drivers of the reliability of the European circle.
The storage certificate will be named and unresponsive
Minfin wishes to prohibit storage certificates against the receiver, but will allow banks to analyse them as an unresponsive contribution.
Minfin is preparing a bill that will prohibit storage certificates against the applicant.
This instrument has recently been popular because the rates are higher than the banking contributions.
The fact is that the remuneration certificates are not included in the Investment Insurance System, and the bank is costing cheaper because the Investment Insurance Fund (AFS) does not have to be recorded.
The impression of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken because of small and medium-sized banks distributing such certificates and would be affected by Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to ABC, control 98 per cent of the profile market.
The share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the Agency, is approximately 3.5 per cent.
The problem, explained in the ASC, is that the small bank clients who bought such a certificate are trying to obtain money in the ASC in case of a withdrawal.
Some investors, without sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates for the contractor, may assume that their contributions are insured.
The absence of insurance payments on these certificates in the event of the revocation of the licence from the bank may lead to disagreement and social tension.
In practice, the agency had cases when contractors were trying to obtain insurance reimbursement through the court," stated ACP.
The problem is, of course, incredible.
In fact, no one will pay certifications to the buyers because they do not have the right to reimburse from the State.
If the instrument was not insured in the ASC, it would also have been prohibited by metal accounts on which citizens were taken into account in grams of one of four metals: gold, silver, platine and palladia.
Because these accounts are also not in the Investment Insurance System, but they exist until no one trys.
The issue is, probably, that certificates to the publisher are a very convenient valuable paper, which can actually act as a quazidneg.
Their displacement is practically not controlled: any bank client can buy a certificate, transfer to any citizen, and a number of householders may change before the establishment of such certificate.
The bill does not accidentally state that the saving certificate should be a necessarily valuable paper to be stored in the depositary.
In order to cute the pill of the banks, such certificates are permitted to be issued without the right of a preliminary exemption.
It is an example of an unresponsive contribution that bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
The weekends were protested by those who protested the NATO Summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the centre of Newport to march against NATO.
And on Sunday, in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at the Warden of Cardiff to what was described as an antisammit.
Steven Fairclaw monitored the development of events during the weekend and talked to the protesters who arrived from everywhere: from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will put weapons in Iraq to counter the terrorist group of the Islamic State, reporting on 31 August, ITAR-TASS, with reference to the decision taken by the Government's representatives, headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reported to send to Iraq 30 transmitting Milan anti-tank missiles and 500 charges to them, as well as 8,000 Shooting Guns G3 and G36.
The supplies will be implemented by the end of September.
Furthermore, Iraq was decided to allocate 50 million euros to humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will make a public statement on that subject.
Germany has not yet placed its weapons in the burning points.
The views of the FRG residents on the delivery of weapons to Iraq were divided.
Some believe that it is the only way to stop the fighters from the Islamic State, others fear that these weapons can eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
The colleagues beat the Ukrainian patrol board in the Azov Sea
The Donetians have beaten the Ukrainian patrol boat in the Asian Sea, reports ITAR-TASS on 31 August.
According to existing data, this happened in the Taganrogue Gulf near the populations of Shirokino and Unnamed (10-20 km east of Mariopol).
A number of Ukrainian media reported the shooting of two coastal guards.
It is clear that an incident occurred today at 16:20 Ms.
Adolescents were taken on a helicopter from the Blue Mountains
TWO bushuoker teenagers were transferred to a safe helicopter after they spent the night, stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and a 18-year-old young man went to a march shortly after Sunday at Howets Lip, Blackheat.
The distressed relatives called the police about 8 a.m. when they didn't come home.
A search team was sent to the local police and rescue team, and a couple found around 11 a.m. near the Bridal Weil waterfall.
The girl hurt her knee, and a young man fell down and hit his head.
The officers stayed with a couple for the night, and they were raised on a swan on Monday morning.
They were taken on an ambulance in a stable state to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Two Unions met
Negotiations at the Summit in Minsk did not solve the challenges for which they were convened, but created a new format: the first European Union members met with the first persons of the future Eurosia
May the leaders of the EU and the Tabene Union discuss the first time a number of " burning problems " for the concerns of Ukraine.
If such a structure is able to work effectively, irrelevantly; but it is clear who took the slippers off the summit.
The questions were raised at the evening of 26 August, when the Belarus and the other Eurosians with the Europeans saw the news of the new President Lukašenko.
The Belarusian leader showed an example of excellent courtesy, which was the behavior of a man who had just broken the jackpot - and planned a decent age in a higher society.
How Mayan Lukašenko helped
The arrival in Minsk of three major European Commissioners (EU Ministers) who met with Lukašenko and allowed him to speak at a final briefing on their behalf -- not just the legitimacy of the President with the 20-year-old interview.
This is an application for the recognition of Minsk as a full act of European policy and the principal mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
The senior analyst of the Belarus Institute of Strategic Studies, Denis Melianz, is sure that Brussels will now not be able to talk to Minsk the same tone as before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met with Lucašenko gives reason to believe that the relationship with the EU will continue to be freezing," he said, "Fire."
The iceberg has a hidden part: the preparation for the breakdown of the Belarus authorities began long before the November Mayan in Kiev in the summer of 2013.
"The results have also been achieved with the EU -- successful negotiations on visa simplification and rehabilitation, dialogue on modernization -- lists the Fire Chairman -- and international security negotiations have been negotiated from the United States.
The States even removed some sanctions.
With regard to Ukrainian developments, they have only reaction to Belarus' leadership.
Minsk, on the one hand, was able to maintain relations with Ukraine enough warm to not lose much in mutual trade, and President Poрошenko could arrive in Belarus for negotiations.
With the second, the Belarusian leader, who did not recognise Crime's accession to Russia and urged Prorocians to be punished in Donbass with all the strictness, did not argue with Moscow.
Minsk did not leave the Tahmonean Union, nor the ODCB, but the Russian Aviation Base was located in Baranovich.
Brussels and Washington noticed the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue and assessed it, as certain by the Belarusian experts.
As successful Lukašenko ' s movement to political diversification, it will be seen as soon as Minsk will have to adopt meetings in the EU+TS format.
In the press service of the EU High Representative on Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to respond quickly to questions on what Brussels expects of relations in a new format.
The press secretary Ashton Maya Kosjančić only stated "Fire" that the issue of war and peace was not a priority.
It was reported that the next meeting on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format could also be Kazakhstan.
The drop of degtja for Minsk was a statement from President Nursultan Nazarbaev, in which he admitted that he was appeared to be personally requested by the representatives of the European Union.
However, at the final briefing, Alexandr Lukašenko made it clear that all parties would not mind that Minsk remain a central field for meetings both in Russia-OBSE-Ukraine and at the level of Heads of State and High Representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” is acquiring a full-handed European leader, which helps solve the global problem.
Best friend of the European farmer
The composition of the EU delegation, including the EU Commissioners for Trade and Energy, has already emphasized the conclusion that the main sub-summit is not a tragic situation in Donbasse, but the economy.
In fact, the schedule for future gas negotiations and the overcoming TSI concerns of Ukraine ' s Association Agreement with the EU seemed to be greater than the peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
The Commissioner for Trade, Karl De Ghuht, however, noted: EU representatives “arrived in Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis which has economic implications rather than the contrary”.
It seems, however, that the crisis in Ukraine also works for Belarus.
His implications -- and mostly mutual sanctions of the West and Russia -- are given to Minsk, who is still in the face of sanctioned pressure, long-expected field for maneuver.
According to the head of the Scientific Research Centre, the former candidate at the President of Belarus, Yaroslav Romanchuka, European investors are actively interested in the opportunities of Belarus to supplies selhoproduction to RF for sanctions.
The supplies schemes for which Vladimir Putin condemned Minsk at the summit.
"Initiators of these schemes, " emphasized Romancuk " Fire " , are not the Belarusian businessmen, but the Russian companies.
They have long worked on supply schemes, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and these schemes have been destroyed today.
The Russian business has a sharp need for them to be restored, even through the mediation of the Belarusian structures.
The second story, continues the expert, is that many Ukrainian companies are unable to manage production in Belarus from Ukraine's commodity also with the orientation of the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion exports to Russia, and Belarus can now be very demanded."
Romancuka believes that the role of the EU and TS field holder for negotiations is perfect for Lukašenko and in terms of development of economic links with Europe.
It recalls that the loss of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow sanctions is estimated to EUR 5 to 10 billion, and the European Commission has now offered only 125m euro compensation to Agrarians.
The President of Belarus may invite Brussels to work together in order to minimize the impact of the euro farmers.
This could raise Lukašenko's authority in the EU to an unexpected height.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the Summit initiative.
The paradox is, however, that the official Minsk, from its active role in the birth of the TS+EU format, renounced, and the Belarusian leader at the meeting with the Ukrainian colleague, stressed that the initiator of the new format was Kiev.
"It was your proposal to gather, without any inadequate discussion, not from the Bay to decide, after the signing of the Association Treaty with the EU, to deal with the situation in Ukraine at that time," he addressed the Chambers to Peter Poрошenko.
However, observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, it was, in the rumors, in the first place, against Minsk's mediation, which has increased its political weight.
The Belarusian diplomatic office emphasizes diligently that Belarus, in the organization of EU and TS interaction, does not pursue the beneficial goals on its land, but the final objective of such a format is to create a single economic area from Lisbon to the Vladivostok.
"It is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that in other areas, in particular in the area of security, promoting and promoting the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation," said "Fire" in the MID of Belarus, a department where the words have recently been scrupulously picked up.
In Moscow, pay-entry zones may appear
The Government of Moscow considers the option of introducing a pay-entry zones as a means of combating the overloading of central roads by analogy to other major cities of the world, M24.ru transmits with reference to Moscow's deputy on transport issues Maxim Lixutov.
One of the options that has successfully recommended itself is a payable entry.
It's an expert opinion, we'll definitely study it, look at all the negatives and positives.
To speak of some decisions that have been made before early," Lixutov said.
Zammera emphasized that the capital authorities of the Asian cities, which are similar to Moscow, were very important.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the already implemented construction of the central ring road, the Lixuts added.
A recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of not necessarily the whole traffic to pass through Moscow.
If there was a sufficient circuit infrastructure, there was no need to have transit traffic in Moscow," said the embarrassment.
Maxim Lixutov also stated that the introduction of salary parkings had significantly unloaded capital streets.
And, he said, the capital authorities do not plan to stop at the achievement.
Recall, on 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobinin, participated in the ceremony of the construction of the first Moscow Central Ring Road (CCAD).
Bored
The film of Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez "Grad of Sins-2: The woman for whom it is worth killing" has committed a very wrong revolution that could be expected from him.
The first " City of Sins " (2005), taken off at the minimum but symbolic participating of Quentin Tarantino, had a revolution in relations between the movies, comicles and the literary nuar.
Sikwell is also revolutionary: in the sense that it destroys the contemporary view of the "thesis antithesis synthesis" chain (if under the teasis the universe of Nuar and the antithesis of comic space).
From now on, it should be read: "Thesis - antithesis - chaos."
"Grad of sins-2" is chaotic both at the dramatical and philosophy level: both times it is chaotic in a stupid sense of word.
Yes, part of the heroes are familiar with the first city, although, here, the wreck of Marv (Mickey Rurk), he remembers, he ended his life on the electric chair, and here, nothing but manages to grab -- in the role of this people's wife -- from the air of knives and other sewings with ducks.
But the old ones are literally pushed by the elbows of the new ones, as if they broke into the city from some other movie, about the meaning and story of which the viewers are asked to not be concerned.
So, his story, unhappy overwhelmed by the authors in the most interesting place, has a super-looking player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
The Lord of Eva Green, and something that revenges her Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But the confusion in which Dwight, we say, is not to be different from Johnny -- even more, the faces, like other parts of the body, are dealing with the characters with unpleasant regularity, not the trouble or even the midwife.
They're not people, we realize that it's a nuar architecture: a year-old bitch who's too sure of himself, who's incorporated in a honey trap of sex, a detective, a corrupt senator.
Well, when the archetype walts with architecture and architecture, it's not a movie anymore, but read that abstract painting.
And asking abstract painting questions about the logic of the story is funny.
Furthermore, even in this crazy world, there is something constant.
Fighting whores from the first city continue to maintain circuit defense against the destruction of their native forces of darkness.
Yeah, and Detective Hartigan's ghost doesn't, and he'll look at the fire, and Bruce Willis is always happy to see.
The main problem "Grad of Sins-2" is another.
Frank Miller was good because, as a painter tallly connected the comic books and a nuar, and as a director, he turned the idea of how to carry comic books on the screen.
Comic and Nuar are two aggressively contrary "realities".
The modern comic phenomenon was born at the end of the 1920s, while the novels of Dashill Hammet "Blood harvest" (1929), the Maltese Socole" (1930) and the "Gassel" (1931) created a non-noir canon called then hard-boiled school - "cool school".
Or pulp fiction.
The comics gave Hollywood dozens of heroes: from the seaman Popaya, a spine eater, giving him rich force, Superman, Batman, and Dick Tracy finder to Halk, Tor, Spider Man and other "revenues".
But in any cinema on comic motives, there was something harmful: the drawn characters did not want to grow in a screen flesh, they were pretending to be around their "real" world's will.
Simplely, they were deprived of "existence".
Noir, on the contrary, is the most existing genre of world literature.
After World Wars, the traditional romance - with experiences, characters, family scandals and historical background - lost all persuasiveness.
What are the Forsaits, which Tibo and Rugon-Makars, even the Bolcons and the Rostovs, after Verden, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a romance was a peaceful mutation in the form of soap opera, and the criminal, by definition of marginal, had increased to the level of philosophy prose.
Hemmet knew on his skin what it was to be a sanitary at the front.
He was a communist.
By the way, at least they were close to the company and the pillars of the genre, such as Horas McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors of Julie Dassen, Joseph Louzie, Edward Dmitrik.
Therefore, the architecture that they set, first, is rough and cynical, and secondly, is very social.
It's almost an American option of socialism.
The first “Grad of Sins” was the only thing that was contrary to natural but organicly connected the comic book with the zero.
For the first time on the screen, the comic book lived without shying at its graphic nature, rather than pretending to be a real film.
The darkness of the sales world, where the cardinal ordered murders and the senator covered the monster sadist son, was worthy of Hammet's feather.
And the painting details such as the heads cut off by the sadist decorated his nest, the feather of the genius James Elroy, the Black Orchidea, and the best - the declaratively nasty representative of the neonaire.
"Grad of sins-2" is not even a retreat, but the capitulation of Miller's radical style--Rodrigues before the tradition of the comic book.
It's probably because of 3D technology.
When you look at the second city of sins, you feel like you're locked in a glass ball in which snow sleeps a toy cloak.
But most of all, it's not snow, it's bloody snow, but what's the big difference?
Well, there's nothing to say about sociality.
Because it's only possible when somewhere, somewhere else, let's have a dirty mud, but there's a normal world where a girl can be returned or, say, uncomfortable parents, that her killer is punished.
But when there is no place in the city of sin except for sin, there is no more sin than a norm.
It's boring like any norm.
Chaos "Grad of Sins-2" is just boring.
For justice, the patriotic sale gave this fresh sin a small but a garlic.
Titres warn that the film contains harmful smoking scenes.
In terms of the vision that the vegetarian episode, in which a man breaks his fingers, it gives a hell of a humor.
Hemmet would like it.
France's socialists should "shut up and bring France to order", said the key ally, Frasois Olanda.
Mr. Valle called for the deeply divided left forces to “promote warm attitudes” to the attacks of the socioist president who had not been endorsed by the oppressive majority of the French.
The President deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay close to him," he said, calling for applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister assured that his Government would not question a controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite the burning proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Olland begged his companions on the Socialist Party to remain “one” with the Government.
However, Christian Tobera, the Minister of Justice, put her sticks in wheels, coming to the meeting of disagreeable members of the Parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to lose faith in the future.
Marin le Pe, a leader of the extremely right National Front, expressed despise to permanent internal conflicts among socialists, saying that she did not imagine that the new Government of Valla would last for a few months.
François Olland is a naked king, but naked and prince Manuel Valle, being forced to gather a new government when the past was not lasting even summer.
"And the new will not last the autumn or winter," said Mrs. Le Pen.
She reiterated its party's call for parliamentary dismissal, saying that she was confident that the party could easily win in preliminary elections and willing to manage.
The ruling party of France survived the disruption of the March municipal elections, and the extremely right National Front came first at the EU elections in May.
The Sunday Journal du Dimanche survey found that 76 per cent of the French believe that the Socialist Party risks to spread into several competitive fractions until the end of Mr. Olland's presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, politician from the University of Syans Po, warned that the French would soon lose their patience if the new socialist government could not fix the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but the public opinion needs to feel that something is changing quickly," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may become even worse.
"The city without drugs" has lost an investigation.
The Swiss arbitration court left without consideration the order directive of the Regional Ministry of Hospital Management to the " City Without Drugs " .
The intention was to acquire more than 7 million bullets from the organization as a rental of the building in the centre of Ekaterinburg.
However, the executioner has not appeared twice in court.
Today, the arbitration court of the Sweddlov Area has left an executive directive of the Ministry of Public Property Management of the region (IUGISO) to the " City Without Drugs " (one of the founders, mayor of Ekaterinburg, Eugene Royzman).
The representatives of the district authorities intend to seek from the organization 7.3 million rubs as a rental of the building.
Today it was known that the prosecutor had not appeared twice in court, which has resulted in the decision to refuse the review.
The reason for the absence of the representatives in the IUGISO Direction was unable to explain, and the Chief of the Legal Division, Maxim Titov, did not answer the phone calls.
The fund's representatives were also unable to contact.
Recall, it is a quantity that was in the centre of the city in Belinsky Street, 19 on a remuneration basis since 2011.
This decision was taken by ex-Guverner Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Directorate of the Ministry of Public Property Management of the Sverdlow Area filed a suit to the Sverdlov arbitral court for the expulsion of the fund from the building.
According to the case, the office required the court to acknowledge the unlocked treaty of remuneration of the memorial.
According to IUGISO directive, the agreement did not record substantial conditions under the rental of a cultural heritage object.
The Sverdlov arbitration court rejected the case and then appeal was filed in the 17th arbitration court of Perma, which was satisfied.
The Fund subsequently filed a complaint on that decision, which remained unsatisfactory, after which the decision was appealed by the Fund in the Supreme arbitration court, but the court took the side of the directive.
In 2013 a new rental treaty was concluded to re-pay the rental fund, told the head of the city, Eugene Royzman.
The rental salary was awarded 300 thousand a month.
The previous administration of the area has transferred this building to remuneration, recognizing our credit for drug fighting, in respect of the fund.
The current administration has decided differently," he said.
Tatiana Drogeva, Ekaterinburg
Why the Mayor of Ecaterinburg was invited to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, the representative of the Ekaterinburg Honour offered the city's mayor, the speaker of the pride of Eugene Royzman, to resign.
A criminal case was brought to the arrested suspect of the murder of the deputy deputy Oleg Kinev, who was considered as a colleague of the mayor.
How Eugenia Royzman found a criminal case
On 1 July, the criminal proceedings on the fact of " slanders " (p. 128.1 of the RF) were known in the Blog of Mayor Ekaterinburg, Eugene Royzman.
This was reported in the IUD on the Sweddling Area, where the Director-General of the Legal Centre of the Protection of Anna Filatov made an appropriate statement.
She said that Mr. Royzman accused her of its blog records that she was involved in crimes that her ex-husband seemed to have committed.
Mayor Ekatheringburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to revenge the truth."
iPhone turns into a wallet
At the front door of 9 September, when Apple should present its new developments, the press appears to have all new leaks on what can be expected from the presentation.
With reference to sources, the US media reported that the sixth generation of iPhone would be equipped with a mobile purse as a result of the joint Apple and payment systems of Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Re/code online resource, the new products of Apple on 9 September could also announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, which would result in a new iPhone 6 mobile purse function.
Companies themselves refuse any comments on this matter.
This function allows the salary to be paid on the store store by using a smartphone.
The identification of the payment will be carried out by the user on his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will be the first time built in NFC (near field communication), which allows non-contact payments with the smartphone and the corresponding reader device on the kase.
The NFC itself will be available through a special microprocessor from the Netherlands High Technology Company NXP (ex Philips Semiconductors).
The first NFC function was presented in 2004 in cooperation with Sonya, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than hundreds of other companies in the so-called NFC Forum, the Promotion Association for Technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first smartphone for the Android with the NFC - Samsung Nexus S - was presented in 2010.
In May 2011, Google presented the Google Wallet system that allows users to tie banking cards to their accounts in Google and pay off with the smartphone to the Android.
However, American experts emphasize that, despite large investments in high-tech companies in the NFC technology, American rhythlers are still cautiously invoking and not too willing to spend money on their stores with such systems.
The observers now hope that Apple's exit to the market will still make the rhylers accelerate and actively implement this technology in their trade points.
MID France: Paris ' s position on the delivery of Mistralias to Russia
The official of the MID of France, Roman Nadal, stated that Paris was unchanged as regards the delivery of Russian helicopters like Mistral.
"I can remind the President's statement of the Republic (Franceus Ollanda) made in his interview with the Le Monde newspaper of 20 August: "The level of sanctions today does not impede the delivery.
This is the decision of the Europeans, not France," quoted Mr. Nadal " RIA News " .
Thus, the representative of the French Foreign Political Authority responded to the question whether the situation in Ukraine would be worsened to change Paris' position on the implementation of the contract
For more information on the delivery of helicopters to Russia, read in the Firec magazine "Mistral" nearly ours.

Activists of the Hong Kong ' s democratic movement disturb the statement of the Chinese representative on the next day following the decision on elections
The Panel of Citizens Loyal to Beijing was standing nearby, waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the Universal People's Assembly of Representatives established on Sunday a procedure under which only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in the Hong Kong's elections in 2017.
All candidates should first be supported by the majority of members of the Movement Committee, which would likely be filled with Beijing loyalists.
It makes the decision almost impossible for the democratic opposition to enter the electoral bulletin and forced the democratic movement activists to reconsider the Hong Kong financial centre with the Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, since Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will be extended to other cities.
Following Beijing's publication of a document describeing China's control over Hong Kong, the activists of democratic movement held an informal referendum on elections in the special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city's business centre and set up a seating strike.
Briefing Lee is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Interior Bureau in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the All-Chinese People's Assembly, Jeang Rongschun and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao State Council, Fang Wei, also had to be presented in a series of briefings during the day.
Students-activators stated that they would be gathered from the building of the head of the Government of Hong Kong at the afternoon.
Britain has not mentioned the democratic administration for Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial governance.
Israeli authorities intend to join 400 ga lands belonging to Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities announced that they were intended to join 400 hectares of land on the west coast of Jordan, belonging to the Palestinian autonomy.
The decision to accede the South Betlehem is to pay for the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
The Ministry of Defence of Israel announced the territories on Sunday and mandated the military to set up administrative management in the West Bank.
According to the representative of Gaza Saiba Aricata, the world public should call upon Israel to be responsible for “continuing settlement activities in the west coast of Jordan and East Jerusalem”.
Putin requires Kiev to begin negotiations on the “State” of Eastern Ukraine
According to the Russian news reports of his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Sunday that the Ukrainian Government stop fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the “State” of the separate region.
His press secretary, Dmitri Peskov, later explained that Putin had not meant to indicate that the Eastern Ukraine territory would be part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine was needed to be revised to give the Russian region the opportunity to protect its rights and interests.
However, the invitation of Putin to the Kiev Government to begin negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels was consistent with the apparent strategy that it had to be taken from the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: to help separatists take the territory and force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly proclaimed territory of New Russia a real independence to draw close to Russia, not to the West.
In an interview with the State First Television Channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the reimbursement of the Territory separatists in the Eastern Donez and Lugan regions, which were captured in March and April after Moscow enclosed the Ukrainian Crime Peninsula on 18 March.
Kremlj and separatists have recently referred to the new-russed territories, or New Russia, as a name that refers to the pre-revolutional days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believes that peace negotiations would take place in the near future when Ukrainian politicians began campaigns for parliamentary elections on 26 October, while government troops attacked peace settlements in separatists held in the regions, the Illusion captain, the ITAR-TASS reported.
"We must immediately begin content negotiations, not only on technical matters, but also on the political system of society and the state status of South-Eastern Ukraine, in order to mislead the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that the words of Putin on publicity were meant in the context of a broader autonomy, which had been discussed for months with the leaders in Kiev in order to relieve fears in Russian areas, that their cultural and language rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The intervention of Mr. Kremlin's press secretary to correct the “faithful interpretation” of the words of Putin emphasized the decision of the Russian leadership to behave in relation to the separatist rebellion in the east in other ways than the open capture of Crime, where most of the two million people are the ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have had to endure a much more difficult battle to join even the Donetsk and Lugan region of East Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million people were not Russians, and the inquiries before the conflict showed wide support for the desire to remain within Ukraine.
The autonomy that the Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would allow regional Governments in Ukraine to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact, by transmitting Kremlu actual control over the territory that would link the main territory of Russia to Crime.
The Black Sea Half Island, accompanied five months ago, is the main Russian military fleet, as well as the commercial marine institutions and historic marine courts.
There are also mines, factories and lithium factories between the Russian Rostov area and Crime, which produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petr Poroshenko proposed during his inauguration speech on 7 June that Ukrainian legislators after the new elections would scale the amendments to the constitution, allowing separate regions to give greater control of their finances and language status.
However, his view of autonomy appears to be very different from the views of Kremlj and separatists, whose arms and incitement are accused of Moscow.
The latest invitation of Putin to Kiev to agree with the leaders of separatists, as equals, followed the new attacks of the rebels last week after the Russian troops and tanks entered Eastern Ukraine from the front of the peace area along the Asian Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia have controlled the city of Novoazsk in the attack that Ukrainian security officers are afraid that it is the beginning of a strategic coastal campaign until Crime itself.
This resulted in the great civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariopol, a steel port of 50,000 inhabitants, which is between Novoazov and a narrow passage to the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday, he called on the European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which was independent for 23 years.
"We are approaching the point of return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take any measures; the leaders called for a draft more severe sanctions against Russia, which would be adopted in case of an escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Iloway after the two pillars of the Russian armotechnical and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support separatists ' difficulties, Colonel Andrew Lysenko, the press secretary of the Council on National Security and Defence of Ukraine reported to the reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers, which were reportedly held in Ilowaya as a result of the Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday by 10 Russian aircraft captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, reported Lisenko on Sunday.
Scandal with naked photos captures Australian celebrity and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his disgustingness to hackers who may have stolen the naked photos of his bride, Gabi Greco, and the whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood was disturbed after a number of open photos of Jennifer Lawrence, naked, came on the Internet as a result of a huge hacker scandal with famous ones.
It is said that a hacker responsible for this has about 60 open photos of the star "Hungry Games" and superstar, including Kate Appton and Kara Delovin, the singers of Ryan, Arian Grande and Lea Michelle and Kirsten Danst.
Australian actors, Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Страхovski and living in Melbourne Greco, were also supposed to have stolen photographs as a result of iCloud's escape.
The list of 101 names of celebrities.
Edelsten, who made a proposal last month, said Confidential: "This is disgusting."
All private census and photos must remain private.
It's terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to others.
Greco, who is in New York, reportedly told the news site that the hacker attack was "shameful" and that those whom she was targeted "feeling invasion."
The hacker is expected to have 30 pictures of Palmer with a former boyfriend Scott Spidman, including two frames where it is located at the pool with a naked breast.
Palmer's work in the movie includes "Love and Honour" along with Liam Hamsworth.
Palmer, the star of the "Chuck" film, and the actress from "Restrained" Browning didn't comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
The representative of Lawrence said TMZ: "This is a sudden intrusion in private life."
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his anger to the hacker, wrote on Twitter: "Tuning photos stolen from the mobile phone is actually nothing different from sale of stolen goods."
Just from a legal point of view, we can't tolerate the publication of stolen photographs.
Detected a potential way of stealing photos of naked celebrations
The mass breakdown of star accounts may be produced by vulnerability in the application Find My Phone.
The The Next Web resource described the potential development scenario.
On the Github resource, a script was published in Python, which allowed to pick passwords to the Apple Find My Phone Service.
This service allows you to track the iPhone location.
The same login and Apple ID connection is used for access to the Apple iCloud cloud, from which famous photos were stolen.
The script allowed the overriding method to recognise the password from Find My Phone.
This method is consistently introduced by all possible combinations of symbols, starting with the most common passwords used.
The author of the script claimed that the number of password options in the Search My Phone service was unlimited.
When the correct security system is organized after several failure attempts to enter the wrong password, the account should be blocked and reported to the user of the attempt to break.
Because of vulnerability, users have not received any reports of attempts to pick the password for their account.
Hackers found the Apple ID password and used it to access iCloud.
According to the report of the Hackapp user on Twitter, vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and there was a script program to select passwords.
At present, vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the Hackapp user and noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability was characteristic for many services, but noted that there was no evidence that such vulnerability was used to access the " star" account.
It's not me, plz RT.
In Twitter, the Prime Minister once again appeared by foreign records
While there is no strong evidence that the vulnerability of theft of photographs was used in the Find My Phone, there was a wave of harmful actions used earlier.
The hackers took over the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple stated that the cloud was not compromised in this case, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, Twitter Prime Minister of RF Dmitri Medvedev was also broken before.
If the criminals had access to the iCloud described above, there could be a password to the government head account in the microblogging service.
The Next Web resource failed to obtain Apple's comment on vulnerability in Find My Phone.

Anger was the most universal and functional human emotion
The angry expression of the person is biologically universal for humanity, and every participating body and muscle group are not random but is an additional means of expressing power and threats, found by Australia and the United States.
They told about their openings in the Evolution and Human Behavior magazine, and you can briefly read them at the press release of the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The wrathful expression of the face is moved and dropped down the eyebrows drawn into the thin line of lips, broken nozzles are the same in all cultures, and it is made by even blind children who have never seen it, notes the leading author of the study, Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project devoted to nature of anger, scientists found that this emotional emotion had arisen for the effective conduct of disputes during the conflict.
The more physical damage one person can do to another, the more he can dictate his conditions, and he brings it to the interviewer by means of anger.
Researchers found confirmations and other their hypothesis: the physical forces frequently angered and passed to handicap, considered themselves the ability to impose uncomfortable conditions for others, and prefer the forced methods to address conflicts to peace.
Disturbing that the anger is first " trade emotion", scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups, which form an angry expression, should represent the angering individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interviewer, and thus make it as soon as possible to agree with its conditions to avoid conflict.
In order to verify this hypothesis, researchers designed people on the computer where each of the seven elements of the angry person had been available or lacked, and showed them to the informants.
Although the abandoned or forwarded beards did not make the face of evil, the more powerful human characteristics of the study were recognized unanimously.
Human anger, like animals, has been threatened: excessive manifestation of its own force, forced to agree and obey.
A man blows his noses and squeezes his lips for the same purpose as the frog who is drowning, or a grabber, who shows his cliffs.
“Anger is launched” by refusing the interviewer to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form of the maximum effective demonstration to the opposing party the consequences of this rejection.
But the most impressive thing is that no part of the anger is arbitrary, they all express the same expression," noted the antropologist John Tubi.
Mincomms offered 250 million rubles of the " Crime" television company
In 2014, the Minicommunication proposed that 250 million rubbers of the autonomous non-commercial Teleradio company " Crime " be allocated from the federal budget in 2014.
This is described in the draft decision of the Government prepared by the agency known as Lenta.ru.
According to the explanatory note to the project, the federal budget subsidies will be aimed at “increasing the cost of setting up conditions for a widespread information on the socio-economic situation and the development of the modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crime, including the acquisition of equipment”.
In particular, it is intended for reconstructing the machine and studio block, video walls, central equipment and video servers.
The acquisition of a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter is also scheduled.
Furthermore, the company will pay for the use of the volcano-optic communications line (WALS) and the repair of the energy system.
Subsidies will be provided within the funds of the federal budget provided for the Mincoms.
The State Television Radio company Crime was established in 1959, broadcasting in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimcotatar, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
Today, the television signal for television is more than 75 per cent of the Peninsula area.
In 2011, the Crime Teleradio Company received a license for a digital television.
