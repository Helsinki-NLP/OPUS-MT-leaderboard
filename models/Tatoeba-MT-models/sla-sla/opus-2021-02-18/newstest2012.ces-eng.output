Parliament did not support a novel freeing Timoshenk
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament rejected the proposal to cancel under the novel of the Criminal Law, on which the opposition leader Julia Timošenk was sentenced.
The amendment that would open the way to release the prisoner's exemption was rejected by the Members when the second reading of the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic delicacies.
Timoshenka was sentenced to seven years of prison in October for the conclusion of an allegedly inappropriate contract with Russia for the purchase of land gas.
The judgment is not authorized, the appeal of the convicted is to speak in December.
Timoshenka calls the judgment a political revenge of the regime, the suspicion of the involvement of the court caused the process in the West.
The proposal that paragraph 365, on the basis of which the exemptioner was sentenced, should be supported in the vote of 147 Members.
226 votes were required to approve.
Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan Liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, has already defeated.
Muammar Kaddafie is buried in an unknown place in the desert, and without him, it's after the war.
It's left to define the winner.
As a custom in the area, the elections win Islamist, but the point is whether moderation or radical is.
The Transitional National Council has joined the customary law of the chariya and we already have a certain idea of it.
Libya will become a country without criminality, for the stealing of a hand is cut.
Women can forget the emancipation, the possibly apostates of faith are waiting for execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, a company consisting of competitive tribes will unit the crown.
There will be a order in Libya that we can't imagine and surely want.
But our way of life is not the only, nor the most objectively best, and it is likely not to fit the Libyans.
In fact, it's a spectacular thing that Islamic warriors took their gratitude from the unbelievers' dogs.
It's only apologize for the fact that from their perspective, NATO attacks were not managed by a general from America, but of Allah, whose size was celebrated in each intrusion.
So when the winners are searched in Libya, the west is not among them.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians relieved the political ally in the person of the dictator without guaranteeing any profit.
After fresh bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq Libya, we are not militaryly occupying.
The local falls with the problem of chasing the crossmen.
But without occupying the oil company, will they have a libyan black gold?
It may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to admire the uncertain protection of human rights.
If you don't have the law of the chariya.
The new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe have arrived in the search for investors
The statistical crush went over Europe on Tuesday.
Single States have published GDP data for 3Q.
The Czech economy interquartionally stagnated, Germany and France are growing.
But the debt market is breaking the records today.
Investors are not only looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria, and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and some other countries of Europe have published preliminary estimates for the third quarter of economic development.
Germany's GDP increased by 0.5% expected, France by 0.4%.
Both countries also checked the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better than expected (a growth by 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), and France stated that it appeared in a mild decrease of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy increased by 1,5 per cent in the third quarter of the year.
However, the fourth year of the year, the gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated and thus confirmed the trend of gradually reducing economic performance growth.
The results are worse than the estimates of analysts.
Most important events:
The Czech economy in the third quarter of the year has increased by 1.5 per cent, but inter-four years has stagnated.
The German economy in the third quarter, according to the preliminary and seasonally recalculated data, increased by 0.5 per cent.
The euro area and the European Union economy between July and September have increased by 0.2 per cent, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2 per cent annually.
Her 10-year-old bonds are on 28.45%.
Contributions from Italian and Spanish bonds grow to critical borders.
Problems also begin to feel Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc....
Contributions in Czech 10-year debts are below 4%, even though the situation in the region is worsening.
The votes from Germany are that the ECB should be a creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs have qualified for EURO.
In Black Mountain they won 1:0 and celebrated process for 200 million
Football team managed the hardest task of the season!
In Black Mountain and thanks to the great Czech and beautiful brand of Peter Jirak won 1:0.
The Czech soccer, even with a great portion of happiness in the second half of time, has avoided a luxury incentive from home revenge and will not miss it again at the European championship.
IHNED.cz was watching a progressive struggle in a detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a big portion of happiness in that other.
The Czech representation also thanks to the completion of the homemade, the great Czech and hero Jirakkov won the Black Mountain happy 1:0 and celebrated the European championship.
Montenegros have gotten in pressure in the second half time because of precise defense of the Czech general.
The Smolars of the fight became Damijanovic with the Vuccine, who burned two great chances.
Even thanks to the great Peter of Chech, the Czech representative will not miss Europe's championship either next year, and the remuneration of about 200 million crowns will be added to the local football.
There's been a lot of fighting football since the opening minutes.
Both teams were hardly involved in the combination and played mostly around the half line.
The pressure of domestic footballists has not arrived in the first half, since the Czech defense was exactly reversed.
The Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a live shield
Several hundred students created a live shield around the nuclear object in Iran.
They want to express their gestures to support their country's nuclear programme before possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed on Tuesday morning before the facility and then caused the death of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred students of universities in Iranian Isfahan created a live shield on Tuesday around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Centre in which uranium is processed.
They show that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear programme by their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) stated in its recent report that Iran had not stopped pursuing nuclear weapons.
The possible attack on the Iranian nuclear equipment is discussed in Israel.
At the noon, the students prayed to the Isfahan Nuclear Object and then caused the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack that would be the most impaired of the Iranian nuclear programme, Israeli press except the Isfahan Centre would also be aimed at the device in Natanz, where the uranium is enriched.
Breakfast and breakfast meals of the child
More than a third of the children aged 9 to 13 years of age have overweight problems, with overweight of 9 per cent of students and 5 percent of children.
But mostly, the children of the community are from families with unhealthy lifestyle, as shown in the current study.
Again, it shows how important it is for the healthy development of the human environment in which it grows and the patterns surrounded.
For example, at the tables of obsessive children, imprisonments are appeared only halfway more often than in children’s families with normal weight.
The roasted potatoes had not a coincidence of more than 19% of the massive ones before a world-related study.
In the fat families, there is also no custom to sport, which, of course, concerns most of the families of today’s students - only 15 percent of the children responded that their parents would find time for active movement at least once a week.
Examination between 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of the last year of school and was attended by nearly 900 children from basic schools from all over Czech Republic.
It was already the second year of the Opesity action is not a coincidence supported by the General Health Insurance and Unilever.
More than 12,000 students from 4 to 8 grades have already been involved in the project.
The right food and sufficient movement in the family is one of the determining factors that cause dramatically rising numbers of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the questioned, for example, indicated that she had five times a day in breakfast-swachina-four-four dinner, which is one of the basic assumptions of proper nutrition," it sounds one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and no evening
Experts note that for healthy developments are essential and relative details, including regular family breakfast time.
In the same time, only 23 percent of the schoolmates have breakfast in Czech Republic.
In most families, everyone's breakfast alone.
And the worst was the discovery that there was no breakfast in a dozen households.
Breakfast is the basis for the right daily food.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obsessive children, unhealthy potatoes are much more often consumed.
Almost every - no matter the weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70%).
Although she regularly sports more than 40 percent of the children in question, their parents were less than half - 15 percent.
Build your dining room
Another part of the survey allowed the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own meals from their own taste and opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 have a healthy nutrition far to ideal."
Among their favorite foods are many wet, massive and sweet foods.
"Alarming is particularly a great favor of sweet lemonades," the final study report states.
For lunch as the main meal, the powders victorised closely above the poultry.
But the children practically did not want the fertilizers, and the love of fish and afternoon vegetables is also low.
Attention to health
The survey also showed that children are willing to adjust their food habits if they receive the right information.
"In the control group of participants who fulfilled the questionnaire after the completion of the Obesity educational lecture, there has been a significant displacement of preferences in a number of cases towards the principles of healthy nutrition," the project states.
For example, it was marking for sweet lemonades where more children would start to prefer ordinary water.
Children also frequently emphasized poultry and fish in the questionnaire as the main food of the day and would limit sweet foods and pellets.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, hard professionals
In the introductory article on how styleists learn, I complained so little that there was a lot of things in the opening classes.
I didn't know what was going to happen.
Talks of three professionals in the field, clothing problems figures, and a seminar on how it goes to the place.
And it'll be worse.
The closer to the final test, the more information and practical tasks are waiting for us.
And even if the course goes on every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "looking."
This time, director Alenka and I discussed (in the course there is no only boy), how to dress a woman who has no perfectly proportionate character.
And that's the most of them.
Somebody's got a short neck, someone's a boy who doesn't have real curves and someone's overweight again.
The stylist needs to know how to optically seize the wide shoulder, extend the neck or add the necessary curves.
We have received tips as in a woman like Jennifer Lopez, so larger tits and sides and a narrow passport, a figure to emphasize a pretty emphasis and not wear a woman too hardly.
For example, if there is a difference between the passport and the sides that the skirts or pants really do not fit, it is worth sewing at least one such a piece of peace.
You will definitely not regret it because the perfectly falling clothes are unpaid.
In a peaceful dress, you will feel much better than in the one that keeps moving you, wandering, passing in the passport, and likewise.
The boy’s figure can afford to wear clothing with wet, apps, sewing or sewing.
Such information and types of figures, of course, are many, so I'm happy that I have a whole week to get all the information in my head.
And anyway, I'm afraid that, given that homework, it's up to it.
Each of the courses have been assigned to a celebrity to make up two outfits: day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the individual and the type of figure.
I'm gonna dress Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret campaign.
In my spirit, I am definitely better for me personally than Britney Spears, Christina Aguiler, who has recently taken a hundred pounds (please, take overtake), or young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut our clothes out of magazines or search on the Internet and print and subsequently graphically process.
The moodboard, as the whole result is called, will also express our personal style and the relationship with graphic formation.
Thinking about the graphical page of style is also important.
Because the stylist does not only physically, but also create so - called product pages in magazines (for specific purposes, such as purse trends, coats, etc.).
That's what a stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us.
But it's just Sunday.
The stylist must have a general review
The Saturday lecture with information on the types of figures has been accompanied by three guests in the field immediately.
Stylist Honza Decent, fashion designer James Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a styleist should be able to use it.
And a fine stylest can work with one piece of clothes differently.
Variability is key in this case.
So such a socket (or if you want to originally trunkcoat) can be wearing classically over the jeans and shirt as a coat, but you can wear it on a naked body, dress the boats and photograph like dresses.
Or you're just gonna take out your gloves or the sleeves, and the whole looks different right now.
"Game with it," he emphasized.
But most of all, I appreciated the following advice: "To work, you need to know the rules perfectly."
"Then you can start breaching them," said Jacob.
So I finally understand why we're shaking all the lessons that we combine with, why, when we see something different in fashion magazines.
Don't even talk about showing.
Thanks to the photographer Ben again, I know that the stylelist must have a much more variance of clothes than how many of them are going to photograph.
So in the fashion story that will have ten pages (this ten outfits), I have to be ready to "stable" at least 15.
And also that on the photo of the clothes it looks and works in combination with other pieces of leckdy completely different than actually.
So we have to count on this in making a suit.
That the image and style makes leckdy to half the success, Honza Ponity confirmed us.
Just look at Madonna, which is not exactly a miracle singer, but image and marketing made her a world star.
In Czech Republic, access to the use of styles services is rather cold.
Even the familiar faces of his leckdy consider it useless (it's enough that I can do something, what I look like is secondary).
And if someone's already letting us make a style, then we're going to count on that he's going to direct us with a completely different (small) size than he really has.
Then there's nothing left to google and find out if the bullwar wrote that the celebrity was thick/small and likewise.
Honza and Mario put on our hearts on Sunday that the styleist is not enough to orient in fashion and to know how to make outfits.
In his work, it is important to be a good psychologist to communicate with people who are dressed, and it is important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing how to estimate people, not to advocate, to stand up to your opinion.
"When a manager orders you to classify her closet and fill it up for nice pieces, you can't throw her out the whole closet and say, for God's sake, it's terrible."
"Find at least a few things that you commend and recommend what you can wear," Mario says.
He also showed us exactly what everything has to contain the so-called "package" or the bag on the square.
It's the one you put around the passport and you have all the goods you need.
In addition to clear things such as scissors, scissors for hair, or closing scraps, there are also lylon threads (stilist helps herself to photograph products such as purse or hats), special clips that we put behind the clothing, if it is larger (spin or other cords are not allowed, they would destroy the clothing), or a sewing.
In order to avoid listening, we also have practically tried something, we learned how to fit our shoes right.
Even in a photo in the athlete where the surface is equal, the irrigation could be damaged, even outside.
So we sticked and sticked.
We can't even touch the shoes with the shoes so they can't be damaged.
So there is really a need for competitiveness.
Mario pleased me when my creature praised me without an excuse.
It's really not my friend.
This is just a small piece of what we heard on the second weekend.
I'm starting to be more clear that devoting to style at professional level is really not a walk of pink garden, whoever says what he wants.
In Need for Speed: The Run races all over America.
Reviews
Originally, the careless ride is transformed into a routine morning journey for a series of totally unnecessary flawing errors.
Although the ambition has been highly completed, it is nothing valid when no one obviously wanted to do anything more.
A new part with the subtitle The Run woke up before the issue of high expectations.
He promised that the Flight Racing Series Need for Speed would relocate a piece in a new direction and from the playlists it appeared to be a game that would not have to be just a number in a genre of action race.
We were also curious about how the passages in which the main hero will come out of the car and run by his own.
But as for the NFS series, many are a little different as we expected.
These are potentially pleasant arcade races, but they are totally dragging down several unnecessary mistakes that have been shown in the series for more than a few years.
So they're not even mistakes, but rather the expression of some kind of unacceptable lazyness of developers.
Adventure begins very well.
You are listed in a story whose main hero Jack has some personal problems and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You'll sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your task is to get first to New York.
The idea brings with it a few interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then to more than 50 races.
This shows that each race is on a different track and that stages are put in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't have a feeling that the game would still offer the same.
In addition, some of the environment are very nice to view, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to previous parts of the series.
So it's nothing in the world.
But the ride across deserts, autumn landscape or high in snowy mountains is visually very pleasant.
Furthermore, the races are rigged from time to time by some untipical element.
For example, in the desert, you are drawn into a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you must be careful not to be asleep by the lavina.
In addition, individual races are pretty well put behind them.
There's only a few types, but it's enough.
So you try to prevent the required number of rivals (in fact the classic race), then you get time again (classic fight with foots) and then you may be waiting for a duel with the only rival.
The police are still involved in this, and all your efforts are still disadvantaged.
The news is the passages outside the cars.
It's more than just an interactive animation when Jack usually runs away from someone, and you have to help him by printing the right buttons in the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
But it will be surprised that these passages are much less than you would expect (concretely even three).
But as a result, it is for the benefit of the matter, because this element does not have a chance to become annoying, and in the context of the above, it is so consistent with elements that make the game strong.
The model goes in the tracks of the previous parts.
That means that it is definitely no longer so much today, but it is not possible to say that it would be a negative.
If you're looking for realistic simulation, you'll have to look around somewhere else.
But more conceived race this road model still fits pretty well, even though we can find better in competition.
Then it's all in perfect order.
However, problems begin to occur after some time.
Unlike the driver's model, it's not a collision model.
From the game of this type, we do not expect it to count complex deformations and collisions, but when you practically have no idea how your car will behave, then it's probably not all right.
Typically, when you drive closely or pass cars in normal operation, sometimes you just lick each other easily, but sometimes in a nearly identical situation your car ends in wild piruets.
Or even attack straight.
The restart system does not give a shit about it, but it will disturb you reliablely.
Restarts are solved so that if you smack yourself or you go far outside the track, you will be thrown back to the last rigged point on the track.
But restarts are only five available in each race.
If you exhaustive them, you have to start the race again.
So it is rather such a tool in case something does not work rather than that you can expressly rely on them.
Sometimes, however, even restarts will not help, they will solve the need to learn that part of the race to remember.
The big noise of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some scrolls are needed in a specific way, otherwise you simply do not enter them.
In another time, you will meet "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you get there first, five, five seconds sooner or a minute later.
Especially in situations where you see between the two opposing cars a competitor walks easily ahead of you, while you get there, cars are already in such a position that you have to run around or brake them.
It doesn't matter when you get to them, because it's "counted" so that the situation is always right in front of your nose.
The rivals also have other advantages.
During the game, you will face several places where, again, no matter what time, the same rival will always be ahead of you in the same place.
Most of all, it's the end of the game on a long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
The enemy must get in front of you, obviously, at any rate.
When it comes in front of you, it makes you feel worse about the anti-cars, so you're starting to get a little bit of a lot.
You can understand the intention to make the game more stressful and more adrenaline, but the implementation is so obvious that it will reliably quickly distract you.
And it's a shame, because even though a simple drive model is playing fun and places, even so actionful that sometimes you don't literally watch where it flys.
And in fact, it doesn't matter if it's the concept of the fifty unique tracks, the sorting of races so that the boring doesn't have a chance, or anything else.
The untraditional idea is to exchange cars during races.
You must be careful about gasoline pumps on the road, because there you can change the car, even though in a total majority of cases, you're enough with what you have right now.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, strong American storms on straight roads and exotic supersports for technical ride, for example, by climbing mountain roads.
With the main history regime, it goes hand in hand and the fashion of challenges, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experienced points into your profile, which is common for challenges and stories.
In order to obtain a higher level of drivers, various objects are unlocked: starting cars and ending with background for profile.
This is connected again to the on-line function Autolog, which, inter alia, compares your achieved results with other players and acquires other communities functions.
One of the other difficultly understood baths is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car, you get to the metro tunnel (butch), where you take it in the darkness of the railways (but).
The tachometer is blinking between 150 and 200 km/h (but) and the meter's arriving in the back, and you'll be unpromised.
In the editorial office, maybe for a few days, we'll hold a debate about whether no one really thought about the game, or if the authors think of us as such a big assassin.
The technical page of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual impression is very pleasant in most cases and in several cases even great.
It freezes so that in some more disastrous moments it falls, and in some cases it's quite tragic.
This concerns, however, mostly, a disturbance with a larger number of participants, where you would not be able to take a picture as much as anything else.
The sound page is okay and soundtrack is a question of taste.
In an effort to like the widest scale rather the younger audience created soundtrack from the category "every dog different village", but it is possible to assume that because of listening to music, someone would probably just buy a game.
Total impression from Need for Speed: The Run is so much disappointed.
If the game was avoided by completely useless mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say The Run is the best part of the NFS in the past few years.
But this is how the game works incompletely.
It's definitely fun, but prepare for mistakes to blow you in the eye by the power of the airport lighters.

Ambassador to the EU Vicen:
Czech Republic has the reputation of negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly broken the balance between individual institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years before the situation gets a little smooth, and before all players get used to their new role," the Czech Ambassador at the Legal Faculty in the European Union, Milena Vicena.
As long as she takes its motto "Certainly and open about Europe" seriously, she has shown in the first part of the lecture when it has been able to describe individual EU authorities and their relations so transparently and understandably that a number of Legal Faculty of the UK could be envious.
Vicena also welcomed the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuye:
"The criticism appeared at first that it was inexplicit, that he was a gray official, that he could not perform any role, and I must say that everyone had a breath that he had made a great job."
"He is a person who can listen to the twenty-seven Member States, to communicate well with them and has a clear vision where the European Union should go."
The new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as an answer to the question, "Who is this European Union? What phone number should I call?", therefore, as an important step to unify and more readable EU policy against countries like China or India.
No one wants to ban us cheese.
Vicena also devoted herself to the European Council's agenda to live and live in the nearest time.
The Presidency of the President of the President of the President of the Presentation of the Presidents of the Presidents of the Presentation of the Czech Republic has been considered successful.
The Czechs addressed the coming financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or arranged the summit for Eastern Partnership.
At that time, the government's fall has then identified a great negative which has severely damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, the "fact froll" was not only presidency, but also the following financial crisis that is addressed today.
Furthermore, the new seven-year budget of the Union must be approved, which is just due to the current economic situation, which is significantly complicated.
Whether the budget will be soft and savings that the sector will receive the advantage that countries will be supported more and less, all this is on the next series of negotiations.
The Ambassador also reminded her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels, "O Europe understandably."
"I really don't like ugly shortcuts, strange words, a hammer that no one understands.
How the citizen should understand that there are really no screwed or round corn in Brussels, bananas differently large, or that someone really has to banish us cheese."
He also wants to better use the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
There is a multi-speed Europe waiting for us
According to the Ambassador, the Czech Republic has the reputation of Eurosceptics and people who notice more negative than positive pages of the matter.
Furthermore, she regrets the low representation of the Czechs in European institutions.
It says that there are many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters, but also low support from the Czech party.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she raised the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
" Believe me, if the Polish and Hungary come to me and the Slovak approaches, the French next to me will say, "Look, what are you meeting there, what's your Visegrad four again?", and they're not even excited about it.
In the future, the Union, according to Vicena, awaits primarily new hard rules for the Member States' budget policy.
Very real, then, he considers the concept of double-speed, not more rapid Europe, rather than the new "European Federation".
"We have euro zones and lands outside the euro area."
"We have space in Schengen, we have a strengthened collaboration institute."
"The first time it was said to cooperate only the lands they want and those who do not want to stand down."
"Their institutions will be more and it will be strongly two-speed Europe," Vicenová expects.
In this regard, she also evaluated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye in promoting the principle that all the topics affecting the entire Union are to be discussed between all Member States, not only among the eurozones.
Brand story:
IBM innovator begins the second century of his existence
If someone was looking for a word that would express the IBM Strategy most precisely, it would probably be "long-term".
For a wide public IBM is a symbol of technological revolution, it is a company considered very current, and yet since it was established for a hundred years.
The basis of this long-term was the first head of the company, Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already given the password that a number of world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His password "Think!" became a print around which the life of the future giant (and also the name of an internal magazine that started coming up in IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of a carefully built company culture.
"For us from IBM, long-term thinking means continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for hundreds of years because she remained loyal to her basic values and was not afraid to change everything else around her.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second hundred we can achieve even more," Samuel J. Palmisano noted at the anniversary of the current director.
Processed system
Watson, in the 1930s, had access to care for his employees, just like the company of Bacia in Czech - the IBM people had a vacation paid, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a developed system for remuneration of the best inventors and businessmen.
However, IBM has a long-term relationship with the customer.
The company has been brilliant from the beginning in talent exploitation -- as one of the first world's companies, it has dismissed any discrimination, so it could choose.
In accordance with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that the Palmisana head of IBM in the next year is centered by a woman - Virginia Rometta.
The IBM has been working for thirty years, yet standing in the position of the selling, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been making so-called holes in recent years, on-line brainstorming, out of which many future strategies and innovations are exhausted.
No wonder there's enough ideas - almost half a million people work in the company.
Institution with a good name
A firm position in business provides the company with its strong internal and external image.
"In the beginning, IBM had rather the concept of an institution than just a technology company," said the Economist of Professor Harvard Business School and the author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technological company, but a company that helps solve business problems in the use of technology," George Colony added from Forrester Research Consultative Company.
As the company itself says, it is the difference between entering the market and creating the market at the same time.
IBM - or "Great Blue" - as her log in the United States has been familiarly named - has grown to one of the largest companies in the world in a hundred years.
It is apparently the most widest technology company - develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in the scale of products from servers to nanotechnology.
He holds the most patents of all American technological companies and five of her employees gained the Nobel Price.
Its invention includes bankomate, payment card, financial swap, line code or discette.
IBM has become the second largest technological company in terms of market capitalization (the first is Apple), when the first time since 1996 Microsoft was in.
View Forwards
Not all products and innovations have been hit in the taste of customers and time - IBM, for example, failed to bet on OS/2's own operating system, on-line Prodigy service or IBM PCjr.
"If your business is built on the move forward, you can't emotionally bond to the past," Samuel J. Palmisano notes.
That's why IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms - and if they do not work, then leave them.
Unlike competitive Microsoft, which is essentially standing and falling on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technologies
The IBM markets are largest participating in services, and nearly five are created by software and hardware.
In 1990, he was the strongest representative of the hardware with more than a half share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profitable assets worth $15 billion, investing $58 billion in prospective technologies during the same time.
Investments also continue from 2008, when the world has first overcome the modern financial crisis.
IBM acts according to his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who also increased the volume of investment during the major economic crisis.
It seems so far that IBM is passing the current crisis untouched.
The IBM share price has increased by 120 per cent rockets since the beginning of 2008, the net profit of the company is constantly increasing.
The IBM company password is to change everything, but not your values.
It is therefore possible to expect that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant can handle it.
IBM History: From the queen to flight to space
IBM (International Business Machines) created in New York 100 years ago, originally had a complex name Computing Tabuling Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was taken up until 1924 - originally used for office offices in Canada and South America.
The foundation for later IBM has compounded four companies whose history touches the 1980s of the 19th century.
The technologies, such as the famous "shoots", were owned by hours recording the employee's arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the supervisory council by 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson's boss to help him handle the company.
The leader then shadowed the founders of IBM - on Watson's thoughts has yet been built invincible company culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as prescribed by her name, began with the production and sale of all possible business machines - from the cuters of meat and cheese on the treasury.
During the first four years that Watson was head of the company, he doubled the turn of nine million dollars and began the widespread expansion of the company to all the world.
Watson was so unfair for the company that nearly forty years in the boss chair, his son Thomas Watson Junior was handling him out.
Under his leadership, IBM started working on artificial intelligence development, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA fly to the universe - to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 a famous human year to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - a series of IBM System/360.
The classic "care" which set up the computer standard at that time, named IBM 5150 came to the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers of the Chinese company Lenovo, purchased the consultant part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began full consultation and services with high value added.
The strategy that's been paying IBM in the last three years is the Smarter Planet concept, "Smarter Planet".
Its aim is not to use smart technologies in unplanned areas and improve the situation, for example, in transport or urban management.
She recently introduced a Smarter Commerce platform for the trade area, which helps traders to run the whole commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country.
She established her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM CHR also operates the centre of strategic outsourcing in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, and there is also a research team of the world level dealing with the recognition of the vote.
Richtary about the unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep that asshole, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Richtar (53) said the end!
After her husband Joseph Richtar (53) became not only a protector of Iveta Bartosh (45), but also a lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and return home.
But now she's not waiting, and she has made clear rules for another life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," explained Richtar.
When Darina Richtar in the summer she provided Bartosh’s asylum in her house, she probably didn’t even imagine how her marriage ends.
Although Iveta moved out of Rican after 30 days of insisting, Pepa didn't leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
During time, Darina resigned her husband’s relationship, and now she even gave him goodbye forever.
The fishermen don't care who his wife sleeps with.
If Richtar and Bartosh broke up only once, the open arms of his wife won't wait at home.
"He's a biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our common house, no one's going to chase him."
"But he will live not as my beloved, broken old asshole, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," Richtar said with the fact that she has left her husband and insists only on mutual decentness.
Joseph, the fact that Darina closed his back door, doesn't bother him yet.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I will be with Iveta, and I won't change it."
"The wife has set up a paper marriage, and I respect it."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, gardens, real estate, shopping."
"Darina and I have a totally normal conversation, but we don't share the beds together," said the Flash Richtar.
If Richtar finds a new love, she says she's not going to stop her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she's going with, and if she has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I'm in love with Iveta and I'm taking all responsibility," Joseph closed up.
The worst women's habits: Are you involved?
When you ask men if they can name any typical female habits, they usually all get out of the gloves very urgently.
Beautiful women, will you be aware of the following lines where there are several female habits that can perfectly pump blood in the veins of men?
Shopping
Does your second half count that you're addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like and buy a lot in discounts?
Then, in your case, you can talk about shopping as a nausea.
Some women realize that their shopping passion should at least be a little humble.
But tell me, who would resist it just walking through clothing shops, looking for a good falling finish, and then try all of them (perfectly in different colors) in the cabin?
Even though most women are hobby shopping, they can literally become a complete hell for men.
Just remember how many times you've told your boys to wait for you before the entrance...
Permanent Dissatisfaction
"I am not too fat?"
"I should lose at least five pounds -- should I start practicing?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Do these sentences remind you of anything?
Right?
Then you belong to those women who are obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their partners complain about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the frequency of this complaint increases, that makes women more nervous.
Order and purity first
It's like an infinite circle.
Washing windows, sucking, erasing the plate, washing dust, bath shaking - at least twice a week.
You're saying to your partner that he's stuck his dirty leg on a clean plate, the kids, that they scratched the screwed washing and screwed up a curved living wall, with which you've given so much work?
If you are suffering from this “failing, ” try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and ordered and purity should definitely not happen within the family in the first place.
This harmless desire for cleanness can endanger your relationships and family comfort.
Ripping
"You used coaches throw into the trash."
"You old socks will wear you tomorrow?"
"The wet scratch doesn't belong to the ground."
If you screw a few times a day like that, you know that you can reliably piss him out.
Of course you don't think it's bad, you want to make it all right.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to take that much...
Pleasure, chatter
For some women, there are also talks, talks, but also insults and combinement against someone.
Women are focused on relations, so they love to discuss things like who, where, who, who, and why.
I hope each of us gets a little bargain or a slander in there.
Hand on the heart, maybe it's owned by all women.
But the reverse is the waves of the most rough grain that they love and often talk, perhaps they despise and are for each other - especially in the framework of the women's workshop - especially dangerous.
Jager and Hooker helped assistants to win Philadelphia
The hockey attacker Jaromir Jagr participated in Monday's NHL match with two assistants on Philadelphia 5:3 on the ice of Carolina and is again headed by the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who added another subscription and was announced as the best player of the game.
Two assistants in the game also recorded Jager's colleague, Jacob Vraček.
After the fighting of the Overseas journalists, the Jager claimed that Giroux had predicted a great evening.
"I told him before the game he'd give him a hattrick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes such a feeling gets over you," explained Jager, after which Giroux gave a goal from the first shot of Flyers.
A little later, there was a second hit in the team with a Czech trail.
The vacuum fighted for the door of Hurricanes and presented it between the circles scoring Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first break, Patrick Dwyer was weakened, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to Flyers.
Especially Giroux.
After collaboration with Jagra, he shot the third goal, then he retailed his arrow in the fourth gate of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but it certainly belongs to the best three," appreciated Jagra of his center.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockeyist like him at the end of my career."
"I'm glad of it."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in NHL, my fellow players tried to play on me, now it turns around," Jager added.
Carolina made a drama from the game, Tuom Rutua's goal, and again Dwyer, who came out of a criminal shooting, came to the contrary to one gate.
But another complications didn't let Matt Read, who finished the number two to one.
"He hit greatly in our Pronger zone."
"He pulled out the collar, I picked up the speed and (Read) went to a remote patch."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," he described the last gate of the fight from his view of the Beauty.
Philadelphia won the East Conference.
The Czech defendant of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček won no fight against Buffal, in the second third he resigned because of the injuries in the upper part of the body.
Candiens lost two-wheel leadership and lost after penalt breaking 2:3.
One of their invasions did not change Tomah Plekanec.
The home coach rather than the lost points was overwhelmed by a large rear row, with only five defenses in the game.
"It's bad."
"We only confronted with one experienced player, the rest were young."
"But we simply can't do anything, we have to deal with it," Jacques Martin said.
"It's been all over us, and we couldn't resist."
"We were supposed to simplify the game, move a knock out of our zone."
We had spaces in this," added one of the P.K. Subban defenders.
The Czech Brancher Ondrej Pavelec contributed to the thirty hits of Winnipeg to win 5:2 over Tampo Bay.
The goals of Jets, who interrupted the five-way series of losses, divided five different shooters.
How travel prices developed since 1989
By 1989, only five state travel offices were allowed in Czechoslovakia: Chedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
Travel offices at that time sold only tours into the countries of the socialist bloc because travel to the West was very limited.
Thus, Czech tourists traveled to the sea to NDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Socy on Krym in the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
The light exception was from the period from 1962 to 1972, when the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime choked to the West and the journeys of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of socialism time was that the citizens of the Socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czech Slovaci) were not allowed to travel individually freely or within socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovakian wanted to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an executive letter from this country, otherwise there was no individual path perhaps.
Travel offices at that time also offered trips to the West, but it was necessary to stand the front overnight with a sleeping room or to have "well-known" in the travel office.
Nevertheless, it was not victory.
The so-called devious promise, which was a condition for the trip to the West, was not given to "politically unreliable people", which could not travel at all.
Since the Czechoslovak currency was not a free exchange currency, without a devious pledge, it was not possible to obtain funds (west currency) for the journey to the West.
However, the Czech Republic had most often spent a vacation in the country, which resulted in a large amount of chat and chalup that the Czechs acquired and survived today.
This is how the Czech travel has experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While by 1989, she was holiday in NDR or Bulgaria with our maxim, the Czechs spent abroad 4.5 million vacations in the world.
The giant paradox that we don't realize today is that we were not able to travel freely by 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia.
The visa responsibilities for neighbouring Western European countries were cancelled immediately in the 1990s, which launched a huge wave of short-term visits, particularly Austrian Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaci couldn't get to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to look at it for at least a minute.
For example, in Paris, the Czech travels in the parks in the states were sleeping, since our income then did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of the Czech travel was the ride of own food, can, salads, etc. to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely exchanged Czech crown, thus our tourists finally could buy Western currency after decades.
However, our life level and the average wages have increased, which has risen around 1997 at another important moment.
As a result of an increase in demand for travel, travel offices have started regularly preparing tours with charter airlines since 1997, making air railways able to settle quantitative discounts compared to the past unbelievably.
In the end of the 1990s, Czech Republic has already had visionless contacts practically in all developed countries of the world, except for the United States, which has continued to make our journey easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the revolutionary journey occurred in 2000, when it was due to a significant demand transfer from the Czech Republic historically the first direct charter flight to the exotics, it was to Thailand.
Since this year, there are direct charters with Czech tourists to warm remote countries, and this year's winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic until 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries will now visit about 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States has cancelled the Czech tourists' visa and thus our country has definitely been set up among the most excellent countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czech Republic spent more than half their vacations in abroad (50.3%) for the first time in history, including the costs of staying in more than 15 thousand.
The valous bunch is to find the Chairman again but threatens the pat
Almost five months is a Czech football without the chairman and threatens that the successor Ivan Haška, chaired by the Czech Republic's Football Association (FACHR), will not be known even after another extraordinary valous crowd that will be performed on Thursday in Nimburg.
Because there is still no agreement under which the electoral order will be proceeded.
Without it, it won't even begin to vote on which one of the three candidates will be elected.
The interest in the Czech football is in Jindrich Rejchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomasz Paclic.
He resigned his function in June and called on his colleagues to unify and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
But in the age of Hashk, the football slipped back to the spots between the two bond chambers that can't agree on a common candidate.
It was fully shown on September 16, when the new Chairman was to be elected.
Delegates of the valous accommodation to the National House in Prague landed for nothing, because the negotiations remained blocked and it was not just a way of choice.
In fact, there was no coincidence with the right to vote in the accumulation - whether only statutory representatives, or even the power-finished officers.
In this single point, there has been partial conformity since then, which has also helped the recommendation of the Constitution for the State and the right to which representation is not possible on the basis of full power.
But the disputes are still ruling the electoral order.
The executive committee has not made too clear to the situation, which is not, in fact, anything else.
The view of choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is, how do you proceed in the 3rd round to exclude the possibility of pat?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the terms or find another model," one of the three Vice-Presidents of FAČR Dušan Freeboda, who represents a professional football in the association.
According to the provisions of the model designed in the third round, the candidates who will have more percentage support in the chamber for no candidate.
Morava is allegedly willing to step down to win a candidate who gets a higher percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech Party proposes the condition that the winner must receive at least two-third advantage in this percentage calculation.
"If it would then dismiss the sense of two previous wheels, it would completely deny the two-commore concept," he understands the objections of the Freedom of the Sea, which makes it the best order to avoid and vote according to the valid positions.
It is a little surprised that Tomasz Paclic also agrees with it, although it is estimated that the rules set by the election order are satisfied with all candidates most to Pelt.
"I wish it had been voted by the stand."
"That there are no substantial nonsense as for the last valous crowd," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time and in his expressions, specifically against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
The new president will be known in Nimburg and believes that candidates will work together in the future constructively.
"All passions will calm down the eventual process of the national team at Europe's championship."
"The football will be on a happy wave again, it will be more willing to cooperate," says a Japanese official who has the greatest experience of the three football management both at the professional and regional level.
Raichl's more delaying.
"I hope so, but unfortunately, the situation is very distracted."
"It is not among the Czech and Morava people, but there are attempts to adapt the rules to their purposes."
"It can cause the blocking of the valous crowd to happen again."
"But I hope he wins a healthy mind," said Raichl.
There's no time left for all parties.
Some negotiations were allegedly to be played directly in Black Mountain, but who knows whether football generality will be complete for the game at all.
The aircraft special to travel to Podgorica, including Vice-Presidents of Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, did not fly from Prague because of a technical infringement in the morning and was looking for a replacement option as a part of the executive committee to the Barage Revenue.
Finally, there may be a decisive meeting at the ministerial level, which may be reportedly happening on Wednesday.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Technical Affairs, Joseph Dobeš, would like to make the participants split inside the strongest sports association in the country to the agreement.
There is a lot in the game: State grant, soccer confidence, and also a set of PLVs, which will address the new direction of Czech sports after the financial problems of Sazaka.
He's going to fight for the president because he doesn't see a suitable candidate
If the Football Chief Plizna Tomasz Paclic saw a strong candidate who would meet all his ideas about the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR), he wouldn't even be joined in the struggle for a top function.
"If a quality adept exists, I'm fighting for it and I'm not going to the election."
"But in the present situation no one has been able to find," said CTK Paclic.
In the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jinrich Rejchl, Paclík's motivation to just make Pelt, the alleged favorite choices, try to avoid the way to the FACHR.
Paclic also emphasizes that, in the event of his victory, he would only endure the role of the President until 2013, when the programme is a proper bunch.
In the function, he would like to see an experienced and high manager who is not too connected to football day.
"I've spoken to some people who would come into consideration."
"To me, it was crazy when some said that at this point, they didn't even want to identify the Czech football."
"I would like to change that view," he said.
Paclík said now the most disturbed Pelt's connection with the President of the Plzenian District Football Union, Roman Berbre, a man with a controversial reputation, known as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence the vote of delegates on the valley crowd.
It is so unacceptable for Paclík to stand in the presidential position.
"If he wins, the current state is reserved and nothing would move forward in football."
"In combination with the support of Berbra, which is an excellent merchant, it would not have done much more to football," said Paclick.
It also entrusts that Pelt's name has sounded in the hearings in the investigation of the corruption affair, but of which Pelta came out without punishment.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring to football."
"And how we would also look in the eyes of EUFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who also takes over his former statement that he would "sell the Plenish Club if Pelta became president."
In case Paclic triumphed in the fourth election, he could imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
He also considers another candidate of Rejchl, whom Paclic supported before a brilliant bunch of fiascosms.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would follow."
"He has great powers."
"I could imagine him as the head of the representative."
"But the manager would not be able to run the association."
"I also don't push my nose where I can't do it," said Paclick, who raised great attention in September by appealing to the judges' committee in charge with Ludjak Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damk.
Pacleck says he'd be a triumph to run the association.
He calls on his ability to manage private companies, and since last year, he is also headed by Plzni, which has celebrated the Prime Minister's Triumph in May with his support.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment to contribute to its cultivation."
"To limit the impacts of some interest groups that need to affect the disciplinary and appeal committee, which takes place in disgusting situations," said Paclick, who did not do their antipaties, for example, to the Spartian boss Daniel Christian.
He would also consider the strengthening of FACHR's relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, which would help lobby more money from the lottery tax for political tops.
"It is one of the key things that the new president should devote."
"If there is a gambling tax, as political parties declare, I understand their arguments, but they must tell where the money is going," he noted.
As an obstacle now Paclick does not even take its connection with the Plenish Club, as he himself claims that the FACHR President should be "overside".
Pelta is connected again to Jablonce, Reichl and Prague Duklo.
"It's not perfect."
"But I don't see the point of conveying my shares to someone hypocritically in the Pluzan Club and returning in a year and a half," said Paclick.
Pelta promised new FACR positions that would exclude the election pat
Two days before the full bunch of football association, one of the candidates to President Miroslav Pelta promised that, in the event of the election, the FACHR would have new provisions that would definitely exclude the disputes over the election order in the future.
The Jablone functioner is optimistic in Nimburg, before the fourth negotiation, and believes that the eligible fight will substantially suppress the possible today's success of football representation.
Pelta has already promised to focus on the representation and acquisition of finances in the case of the election.
He decided to go to the election before the last bunch, so he could use a two-month delay to defend and present his ideas about football management in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"They feel that it is the highest time to lead the association," thinks a man who is connected primarily with the Jablone club, but who has been in Sparta and the executive committee of the Union.
And that's why he thinks he has enough experience to drive the Czech football.
He is convinced that there is an eufory in the time of Ivan Hashk.
Unfortunately, on the June's valous accommodation were approved, which were not as perfect as everyone thought.
"If different interpretations were not accepted, we had the president since September," Pelta warned.
He has just reconstructed the most important document of the Civil Association as a branch to the delegates.
"If I become president, I will take it as my personal assignment and willing to take personal responsibility if it fails."
"It's a principal thing we can't be without," says Pelta.
He says he's still trying not to define against his rivals.
He had before revised that he could imagine collaboration with Jindrich Reichl, who he recognized because of his legal education, and he well knows that his contra candidate would be his first vice-president.
He has not attacked Thomas Paclík for a long time, who did not leave a dry thread on Pelt.
"The football moves something over a year, he's already got some success."
"His attacks, however, were inappropriate and many people in a way of the election campaign jumped."
"I therefore a number of them now doubt his real nature," he said to the opponent's address of Pelta, who is saying he remains faithful to the pronouncements he has already announced in September.
His strongest weapon, he believes, is the knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the representative.
It should be an exhibition soccer box.
"And I would also try to end all the affairs starting with the cause of the Bohemians or the sounds of the last year's corrupt scandal."
"I would then go to a meeting with the private and public sector to ensure enough money for the whole football," said the CTC sixty-year-old candidate two months ago.
Then he also promised that his arrival to football would not mean any personal cleaning.
"I should first meet the full of individual employees," he pointed out in the Strahov, where there is understandable nervousness from the long rulership.
Despite today's catastrophic scenarios that carry out an intensive bunch of people, they believe that the delegates will not go to Nimburg on Thursday.
"If the only controversial point is how to vote in the third round, we can move through it."
"The football needs confidence, and it only gets here by finally having his leader again," Pelta remains two days ago, perhaps the decisive day of its functional career optimistic.
Raichl promises FACR would start working hard under it.
If the new Chairman of the Czech Football Association was elected by the Vice-President Jindrich Rejchl, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Because Raichl promises that in the case of his choice, he starts to work hard.
He wants to make systemic changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the cause of Bohemians, to improve relations with EUFA and FIFA, to bring more money to football and to continue the work started by the former President Ivan Hašek.
"As the president, I would like to devote football as a whole."
"After international contacts with EUFA and FIFA through representatives, professional football, performance football after youth."
"I do not say that I would do everything myself," said Raichl in the interview for the CTU.
"I'm a team player and I want to share competence in the executive committee so that each member is devoted to certain areas."
"And I'll give hard tasks to move football a mile forward in every segment."
"Mnogy people would probably not be happy because it would start working really hard and not just criticize the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in football movement, he said he was thinking about not running again.
"I'm aware I'm working 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will always throw sticks under my feet and question every step I have," he explained why he was hesitating.
"But many people told me I shouldn't give up, because then others would give it up."
"That's the trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He's also motivated by continuing the work he started with Haske.
"In those two years, a big piece of work has been done, and I don't want to throw it away right now."
"There are launched processes that will be sounding in a few years, and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said with fear that if another candidate Miroslav Pelta was elected, the situation in the union could be returned to the time before the Hague.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's the thing Mirek Pelta does not think."
"There are mainly people who would do soccer so that it would be only for those chosen."
"I'm a lot of things that can be distracted, but I'm sure I'm not being away from someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football for everyone, because then everyone will be well and not only those chosen," said Raichl.
It also distorts the claim that he would only be the Czech President.
"Although some people are trying to say the opposite, I plan to make the maximum for Morava."
"For example, it is time to think about the second league divided into the Czech and Moravian part whose winners would go into the first league."
"The current situation would not occur when only three Moravian generals are in the liaison, which is a problem towards young players in Morava," Raichl said.
Since the boss of the Pluzny Club, Tomasz Paclic, also involved in the fight for the President, Raichl is not up to considering his chances to be elected.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me to be its Vice-President and sees the clear success behind me," said Raichl, who considers the saving of tens of millions of crowns on unfit contracts, the negotiations of TV contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law.
On the contrary, he considers the collaboration that the union does not pull for one rope.
While Pelt declares that he is "disqualified from returning to the Czech football trust", the other of the rivals of Paclík considers a strong candidate who has a soccer to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Plzni in that year."
"If he was chosen, he might continue with the things that Ivan Hašek launched here, and no matter how he would change his personal employment in the committees."
"He wouldn't crush it for his sake," Raichl's rivals evaluated.

The lying sign on the water, looking at the height of the artificially formed dome, swimming across the marble trails (grave a small naked boy, a child (will wings)) who waited for her on the edge of the pool and admired the closely restauranted separator.
If some swimming swimming she liked, she put it in her notebook in a moment - even with remarkable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 ploweren studied this way by the historian of the architecture of Meder and now presents them in its just published book "Badefruden (Badefruit of Bath) ": People's Swimming Palace in Mnich, the historic palace of swimming in Schwarzwald," The hard core of concrete buildings" in Taunus.
13 countries led her "The way for the most unusual baths in Central Europe": By Germany, Austria and Switzerland visited the locations in Italy, France, Czech, Slovenia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old Germany is a genuine entusiast of the sailing culture.
With sports, it doesn't overcome much, says Meder - it's just in the water, it's something else.
It is only angry that fans of swimming must satisfy the blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while the health runers can breathe the deceptive smell of woods or listen to the joyful swing of birds in the park.
"One day I asked why the sailings must be always so scary," said Mrs. Meder in Vienna.
"So I started gathering nice shops."
Water level doubles the architecture
The swimming in the scocanic pool and the ethical oil for sauna - the comfort factor is so large that it concerns all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders were trying, the swimmings could be a real pastern for the eyes, "Instead of the floor, a man has a water level."
"But it's transparent, on the other hand, but it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is optically doubled: high clone, peasant tiles, jumpboard boards.
A little format image link "Badefroden (Badefrouden joy from bathing) " provides on 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of historic oaz wellnes - but mostly the desire to jump into blue.
The remarkable examples have been discovered by Mrs. Meder's collector in search for Hungary.
In addition to beautiful medicinal bathrooms, such as 100 years old Shechenya baths in Budapest, she found water with the contents of nitrogens in the original beautiful cave (the cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal bathrooms whose pools are filled with alkalic water and are located in the building of bottle shape (Varosi Termalfürdö in Jasberna).
A beautiful view on the other hand offers many heated flours under the wide sky in Switzerland and Austria. As long as a person has a curish bathing room on the eyes of the whole city, the outside pool in St. Anton can be viewed in the snow covered by Arlberg - and: in the pair baths there is a window from which you can monitor the movement on the ski convention.
Hopefully the most remarkable design of the pool expects the bathroom guests in Längenfeld: Aquapark Ötztal looks like ufo that just landed in the Alps.
From three top open panves in the winter, a pair rises while the back of the mountain Ötztal faces to heaven.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not in every sailing room, the pool collector of Mrs. Meder smell of chlorine in the cream.
Many thermal baths are to smell cheese, in the Arpes in Hungarian Bekescsaba bath, it smells like a warm oil to the extent that a person can hardly believe that he has gotten into the treatment baths.
The smell comes from the medicinal water with the contents of alcal hydrogen hydrocarbons, which is almost black and whose seeds are crawling on the skin once only a person slide into the pool - somewhat special experience of wellness.
However, one place was also disappointed when Iris Meder was looking for nice baths: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate bathroom of Luhačovica, she met a closed area.
During the year 1902, the architect Dushan Jurkovic was closed.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the broken windows of the red-white-yellow secession building, she saw the growing grass between the tiles.
The disappearance was contrary to the magic swimming room in Schwarzwald: in Palais Thermal in Bad Wilbad.
These bathrooms already have three stages of construction; a person can discover not only new Romanian elements that originate from its origin in 1844, but also the Maurean hall in the style of Alhambra, which was connected around 1900.
Since careful modernization 1995, Palais Thermal is the favorite bathing site of Mrs. Iris Meder, not only because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"It's already some kind of performance, connecting such a variety of construction sites to such a beautiful complex," Mrs. Meder said.
In such a palace, the flooding into thermal pool is apparently a border issue.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank lets you check the commodity trade.
Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank leaving his agricultural trade?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Joseph Ackermann authorized a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
Then in January, the chief of the concert wants to get the consequences out of this.
Hamburg -
For the community citizens, it is clear: 84% of the Germans find it unacceptable according to one study to speculate banks with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of the questioned are even demanding that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions come out of this trade because the problems of the poorest world are deepening.
This is the result of the Forsa survey of the Foodwatch consumer organisation.
The study is based on the report Foodwatch presented in the mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann states in it that the stakes in global commodity markets are extorting prices to the height, and that is why banks are cooperating with the world's hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank Josef Ackermann, even though the large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting the same way.
Firstly, the commodity bets were thought to ensure traders against price shifts.
In the meantime, most experts agree that the capital market participants with the interest of high-risk trade were disconnected from offers and demands - and on the account of the poorest profits.
Otherwise, competitors in the United States responded to the criticism of Ackermann: He promised that he would check the cliffs and said that no trade "is worth having a good reputation of Deutsche Bank bet."
According to the information SPIEGEL ONLINE controls the international working group of the Foodwatch-Report.
By the end of the year, the control should be closed, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank, together with the recommendation of how to deal with it.
In the end of January, the bank's representatives would like to communicate the consequences they have.
At the end, there may be a reduction in trade with goods or even a complete refusal.
Ackermann works with his help on his image.
The head of the Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time strengthened his financial sector's criticism: "The sitting on a growing food price shows especially drastically how unreasonably banks today harm the general welfare."
Let Ackermann, as the highest bank lobby, be obliged.
"Deutsche Bank must scratch out of its portfolio all the items for which money is used for food prices," said Bode.
"Whether Mr. Ackerman is hungry or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's view appears at first as a surprise, but it is clear that the concertal chief several months before leaving his office would like to leave the perfect image.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board would not go to the supervisory council.
By turning away from a controversial agriculture speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about possible losses - he should finally deal with it with his successor.
Each other would confess investments in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
More than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, he published a Bode survey in which the Forsa Institute asked 1001 people.
Accordingly, 11% considers that Deutsche Bank is legitimate to offer investments with which food prices are linked.
Many customers of banks would also have personal consequences if they found out that their bank is participating in such trades: Each other would, as a result of the survey, declare all investments in which money flows into raw material speculation.
43% would warn known to such a bank, 49% stated that they would consider exempting their account and go to another institution.
Home of the 21st century in Vienna
Moved Pavilon
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with tops, falls and happy end: Austrian pavillon from the World Exhibition in Brussels 1958 gained prices, became a Museum in Vienna, remained empty and deserted.
Now it's opened again as an exhibition house.
When it burns for the modern war architecture, for clear forms, glass halls, courageous expansions and new construction materials that are typical for faith in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzera for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958 is an excellent and famous example.
Schwanzer's pavilion then received Grand Prix d'Architecture for his light and prosperous steel and glass structure.
The building is still considered a million of the current architecture.
He celebrated the architect by also building a pavilion of Austria for the next world exhibition.
With his legendary four-wave BMW-palace plus as a key performed by the side building in Mnichov at the end of 1973 internationally celebrated.
He was placed in Schweizer Garten as a temporary exhibition building designed by a pavilion after the world exhibition at the Vienna Südbahnhof (South Station), reconstructed and opened the 20th century Museum in 1962 - was named "Home of the 20th century".
But the suitable building for the museum was not, neither space nor technically - lacked walls to hang art exponents, no suitable climate.
However, it was used until the current art was expected in Vienna for a new stand.
Since 2001, the building has been empty, and it has grown more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz pavilon reconstructed, now bearing the name "Home of the 21st century" and will be used as the Museum of Current Art in the future.
On Tuesday night there will open the Museum Belvedere, where the palace belongs, the first exhibition - a happy purpose in every way.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere 2007.
Husslein-Arco, the promoted history of art with a significant career, i.e. in youth, a croscourist, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim's museum and as the founding Director of Musea modern Salzburg, has made a substantial reconstruction for politicians and monuments, provided public funds and private sponsorship money and determined use.
In addition to the current art, the works of the flyers of Fritz should be exhibited by the same funds, café and bookstore should be built and the office building must be built.
Strict surveillance, low budget.
The Crischanitz was then an ideal job.
Not just that he emotionally reconstructed and expanded the separate buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and won a competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer's Technical University Vienna and Pavilon was an "inconsistentially important place" for him, in which he "very every weekend" watched his exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he also knew the problems of the building, which already lost her generosity and lightness when he moved to Vienna and changed the use.
In this reconstruction, there were much bigger problems: Building was a "catapulte for energy", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass fasada were exchanged, used by glass fibres of exhausted isolation glass and a glass roof replaced by a special security glass.
The cold steel bridges were strengthened or replaced, and the azbest filled ceilings were sanctified.
Two underground floors provided a place for new use, the launched lighting channel between the building and the streets provides lighting, the bridge leads to the entrance - nearly new construction, but still the highest Schwanzer pavilion.
The original input door remained preserved, the building is coated in an old anti-corrected red brown tone.
And the movie is even exactly the same as he used to be.
And all of this for the strict supervision of the memorial office and the low budget.
"The material must have often been found that is good and cheap and also liked the Memorial Office," Crischanitz said and pointed out the broken floor of the basement.
Despite all pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and air.
He said it was difficult with a pavilion, "who came here from Brussels," said Crischanitz recently, typical "Drop-in-the-City history".
Such architecture says "everything in the wrong place" and still wants to "be the right self-conscious."
In this case, however, the home of the 21st century is not in an inappropriate place, because it happened a urban happily coincidence: In the circle around Schweizer Garten, a newly designed "The City Road at the Main Station" with office and residential houses.
And perhaps another lucky coincidence: The home of the 21st century could receive support from another Krischaniz building, because the collection of Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and as they hear, he's already dealing with the city about the neighbourhood in Schweizer Garten.
The road plans a winter crisis package in millions
The road set out a crisis plan to prevent winter train losses.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It's gonna cost millions.
Deutsche Bahn is issued in the fight against winter caused by trains and delays in this year, according to the report of more than 70 million euros.
The "Bild" has previously submitted an appeal to the internal concert plan that it is counted by 2015 in total of EUR 300 million investments.
It is said that better use of trains and rail networks should also be achieved under extreme air condition.
It is said that the number of internal and external employees of 16,000 persons is planned to remove snow on railways and accessories, among other things.
The aim should be to eliminate the steel to start operation and 90 per cent for the operation of the necessary shifts within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the chief of the Road Rüdiger Grube warned after meeting at the highest level with government and industry representatives against railways and delays during this year's winter.
In the last winter period, the road had significant problems in personal transport because, inter alia, there was lack of reserves under difficult air conditional conditions.
This is how many new regional trains have been waiting for the approval of the Federal Railway Authority for years.
Furthermore, the delay in ICE train transport is accessible
In the course of the years, it is also not possible that ICE train fixes must be more frequently verified when one ICE train at Köln's main station has occurred to destruction.
Deutsche Bank pays a million penalties in the United States
After the disturbance around Joseph Ackermann, there are new tramps in the U.S.: Deutsche Bank must pay millions compensation there.
As if Deutsche Bank had not had enough problems at home, the giant in its past in the U.S.: the Frankfurt Institute has paid $145 million in one countervailing procedure (106 million euros) to settle disputes for the bankruptcy of five large social banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage sheets.
The NCUA financial market regulator commends a number of large banks that the companies have made false promises to buy financial products; that risks may have decreased.
Such papers have lost significantly during the crisis on the value and have ripped banks with them into a ruin.
"We are pleased that we could address the subject without having to draw parties to court," spokesman Deutsche Bank said in New York.
The bank doesn't admit any guilt by compensating.
This also applies to Citigroup, which was committed to paying $20.5 million.
The NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the courtesy of both monetary institutions.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. association banks and helps bankruptces to protect customers' claims.
The NCUA is trying to get a compensation for the generated billion damages.
Now the ending comparisons are the first of their species.
The regulator also joined other large banks and summer sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In suspicious hypothetical papers, it is called Mortgage-backed Securities.
They're based on bank loans.
When the American bubble around the real estate in 2007 cryed, it became a number of financial firms fateful.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, U.S.-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed her mind.
Even though the event happened a few years ago, he's blowing the banks in a sharp wind.
Investors and supervisors have filed a number of complaints in order to achieve repairs or doubts.
The Federal Houseing Finance Agency (FHFA) launched the largest suit wave.
It points to 18 international banks that two American state funds dealing with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's real estate at shops with mortgages in a volume of approximately $200 billion have disadvantaged.
Also, Deutsche Bank has to face FHFA's lawsuit, which is more trades in total of approximately $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The Authority requires that the Frankfurt Constitution be responsible for "relevant losses" without prejudice to any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the requirements as unfounded and declared that she wanted to defend herself.
Warren Buffett enters 10 billion to IBM
Buffett's financial guru is investing strongly in the IT surveillance IBM.
Since March, he bought a share worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, an important American investor Warren Buffett has always declared that he will not invest in IT and computers, because long-term development of companies will only be difficult to predict.
However, he now read the IBM business reports and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
Much earlier, he had to understand that IBM offers services primarily and provides computer systems for the IT division of other companies.
The investment of Warren Buffett is considered to be a match for the knight in the financial world.
As a result, IT IBM is now called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett broadcast in the US Economic Radio station that he bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5%.
Buffett sagte that neither IBM knew anything about his engagement yet.
He praised the management that he tried even for the proper profits during the economic crisis.
"You've done a great job," Buffett said to the strategy.
IBM has been betting for a long time on lucrative IT-services such as the operation of the calculation centres.
More than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice and performance computers for companies.
Buffett's been avoiding technological companies until today.
It claims that it only invests in undertakings whose activities he also understands.
Instead, Buffett struck on a cargo railroad, after the manufacturer or after machine manufacturer.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway owns around 80 own daughter firms also shares in a number of high-concerns such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, former Münchener Rück.
The 81-year-old master took over the 1960s of the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and built one of the most valuable businesses in the world.
Still, his way of life is modest.
He is therefore a cultural figure for many investors around the world.
His almost unfair sense of money earnings brought him a nickname "Oracel of Omaha" (Omaha's miracle).
When Buffet's investment became famous, the IBM shares increased before the bureau started by one percentage.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, has a total value of more than 220 billion dollars on the market and is placed together with Apple and Microsoft as the most valuable technological enterprises in the world.
In Microsoft, so much Buffett, but he wouldn't want to come in.
The founder Bill Gates says he's a confidential friend.
Threats are material
Following the discovery of the Zwickau Buildings, Turkish media suspect the German legal state.
The newspaper even speaks of bloody ideology, which now lives again.
The killings of eight small Turkish businesses and one Greek in 2000 to 2006 had a legal extremist background.
This report was responded with fear and concerns in Turkey and within the German-Turkey population in Germany.
Because for many German Turks, it returns to the scary that was long considered dead: from the burning attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Sollingen in May 1993, there was no comparable violence with the right extremist background.
There was never doubt in Germany.
However, the discovered legally extremistic network reveals the scope of which the dimension cannot be observed for a long time.
"Renewed bloody ideology?" were the titles of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk" online.
The Sabah newspaper, on the contrary, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators was to be a secret police officer of the Constitutional Protection Office and fears that the German authorities could also be involved in the right radical moor.
The Turkish community responded reasonably: she mentioned the weekend of demonstrations by silence in front of Brandeburg's gate victims of racist violence.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, along with German and Turkish politics, recalled the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkey Labour Agreement.
In joyful colors, a common life was embodied - as a history of success.
As a polyček here, several Turkish media reporting: "Germany's gift to 50s" is the title of the article in the Turkish online platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also, the issue of Hürriyet has not been married to Germany so as to prevent this thought connection.
"It starts to smell," the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
It emphasizes that people who paid taxes and their work have contributed to the renewal of Germany were killed.
The most critical discussion is discussed in the German Croatian Internet Forums of the police process and its late success in search.
Why didn't the German authorities think much earlier to search for the suspects in the right extremist circles, the authors wonder.
So many show at least a rhetoric emergency for the use of drastic means: "If the activity continues so surfacely, there will be nothing else to immigrants but their own defense and arms."
"It might be the best self-defense."
"The quality of explanation and suitableness of the punishment of the whole network is very strongly dependent on internal peace in Germany," says Selen.
Which means if internal peace in Germany is threatened, they explain the assassinations in Mölln and Sollingen in the 1990s.
The photograph of the burning site in Sollingen is deeply injected into the memory of the Germans and Turks.
Because no other event has shown to Turks here more clearly that there is a massive threat and the Germans that untrustedness and departure can result in right violence
However, assassinations made Turks more apparent to each other.
Do not repeat past errors
The Turkish press was particularly criticised by the failure of German politics after the assassination: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mölln.
After a burning attack in Sollingen, he sent a condolent telegram to the Turkish state president, but he was allowed to represent his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then, in his speech, to calculate the fees that the Turks were paying.
It's quite as if the value of a person was measured according to the amount of his tax.
The current reporting of Turkish media again shows how deeply the untrust of many German Turks in this country's legal arrangement is.
In addition to the efforts to explicitly clarify and the new assessment of legally extreme terrorism in Germany this time, this requires open words.
Scandal Bank near the Curysh Lake
The most friendly bank of Europe has no seat in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered almost bankruptcy in the financial crisis and from then on from one crisis to another.
Now there's a German to compare it.
That's not what Axel Weber thought.
After his loud departure from the leadership of the Federal Bank, in July, it was known that 2013 would enter almost the same spectacular new job: the President of the Swiss Governing Council of the UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in career.
Axel Weber looked forward publicly, praised Switzerland for his beauty and UBS for its new acquired solidity and told friendly notes to future colleagues.
"De UBS has reached the turn."
"I'm looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September, it was clear that everything would be completely different.
One UBS dealer in London circulated all bank security systems and lost approximately 1.7 billion euros.
The head of UBS Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland a recognised banker, had to leave.
The President of the UBS Administrative Council is also as burned - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already become known that the Weber bank has been advised since February 2012.
And the Presidency of the Administrative Council will take over in May - not only in 2013, as the bank communicated on Tuesday.
It'll be hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economy and emission banker, and he would certainly need time to work.
Suddenly, he will take responsibility for the bank's strategy, which has just once proved to deserve the title "Bank of the biggest scandals in Europe"
However, UBS is enormous - until recently, she was the biggest managing of property in the world - and slipped for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, so it seems, will not remain proud of the Swiss bank saved.
It started in a financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS took excellent reputation.
The image of a silent and solid but also smart owner of property combined with ambitious goals: She also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
So UBS 2007 managed on one side with $1.6 billion more money for rich clients than any other world bank.
On the other hand, the investment bank went into the League of the biggest world banks
That was an impression.
Former banker and later a long-year-old banking professor in Curych Hans Geiger tells: "I always put UBS to my students as a model of a good bank."
"And from today's view, how could I just be wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it was for the first time evident that something in UBS was wrong.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, head of the office, who was still considered highly intelligent and brilliant banker.
A few months later, he knew why he left.
The Investment Division of the Bank screwed up Subprime-papers and had to write down billions.
In order to stop it, she revised UBS increases in capital of really 13 billion francs.
Therefore, she found really investors, however, those over whom she would have recently emphasized the nose: the Transparency Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that a person had not even known his name.
But it was just the first stroke.
In April 2008, it developed worse.
The Bank had to acknowledge new billion losses, the President of the Governing Council, Marcel Ospel, 2006, the second best paid Switzerland Governing Council, resigned.
In October 2008, there was a disaster: UBS stood in view of its mistaken investments for the financial crisis from a crash and had to be saved by the State.
Nationalbank bought from UBS for tens of billions of troubled valuable papers, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs to mandatoryly exchangeable bonds for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole Switzerland was shocked - because it noticed how dramatic it is for the small country when it has so large banks in its territory.
Finally, the UBS 2007 balance amount was more than five times higher than the performance of Switzerland's economy (see picture).
"We can't save UBS once again," says Bank Expert Geiger.
The first catastrophe is the second.
For a few months, UBS has капitulated in a tax dispute with America and has demonstrated its willingness to issue data of the prosperous customers who, as possible, reduced taxes by the bank.
Furthermore, she agreed to pay $780 million - as returning unlawful profits from these shops, including a penalty bill.
This revealed UBS more or less openly that it helped to reduce taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in a competition for rich clients: a discreetness sanctuary.
After this scandal, Swiss bank secret was no longer what was earlier.
There was a withdrawal from the head of the branch and the President of the Administrative Board.
And the exodus of customers' money.
Thus, the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas over a few months: in investment banking due to bad speculation and in the management of the property to help reduce tax.
And just when it got a little relaxed again, just when it was thought that UBS was recovered again, here comes this unhappy business anabase: the only dealer wasted 1,7 billion euros before the bank noticed something wrong.
And it's clear: with risk management in investment banking, it's obviously still unsuitable.
"The case of Adobali must have found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Jansen, an economist and Finanz professor of financing at the Bank Institute of the University of Zürich.
The Finance Director of the Great German Bank is also sure: "The problem of UBS is that he does not control risks."
However, it was exactly the idea of caution that Swiss bankers have made up with long ago to become guardians of the great property of the world: no risks too much, so money security -- also from this side, the world has fallen down again.
Swiss bank treasures have become a symbol for unrestrainable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngle for specially quality chocolate.
UBS Centre in Curych is still suitable for the cliché of the good Swiss private bank - is just a little bigger.
The location is classical.
The Bank has its headquarters in Curish Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Curish Lake, which is incorporated by the snowtops of the Swiss mountains.
Buildings here are beautiful, trade rentals belong to the highest in Europe.
The jewelry such as Tiffany's are found here between Swiss traditional stores such as Sprüngle sugarstones.
For centuries, Swiss banks are located here: from Nationalbank through Palast der Credit Suisse to the elite private banks like Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is entering with heavy rotating doors.
Inside the walls are covered by marbles, standing in front of them with powerful skin chairs, next to the bank's logo, a big direction towards the "serif".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank, both Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suiss, but sometimes - suppressed or betrayed, as found by the chief of a small Swiss private bank.
His name would rather not read in the newspapers, eventually closing, like all the Swiss bankers, as well as with both big banks.
UBS may have increased too much, it finds -- especially in the investment banking, where the Anglosas have also expanded.
Swissmen don't think they have anything to say.
"And if they were, they'd adapted to the English ways long ago."
In fact, it was an English investment banking that changed the UBS, leading her first high profits and then a disaster: No European financial institution lost as much money as Schweizer Großbank in the jungle around Subprime.
The catastrophe was obvious on October 15, 2008.
"In that Wednesday, the government coalition of a small seven-million country took place to the greatest rescue action in his nation's history," wrote Lukes Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
As soon as 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros approved by politicians to save from the bankruptcy of a large bank.
How could that happen?
If they talk to Swiss bankers, they see your problem mainly in UBS size.
In June 1998 two of the three Swiss banks joined in a powerful concert.
A bank has emerged, which has already been too large for small Switzerland - and has grown still.
However, it helped that both different banking precedents of UBS were supplemented: One rich but asleep bank in Curych with burden in the management of property and poorer but internationally more involved.
Suddenly, internationally-nationalized investment bankers came to benefit from many money that could have made a big rule.
With this increase, UBS are linked to two names: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, head of UBS and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the Governing Council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a team of the future," said Bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest, who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, a man who's been emoting around the stomach, who's made himself completely up from banking science."
But Ospel said he relied on Wuffli at the end.
And Wuffli probably made the decisive mistakes at the end, "If he thought his models were reality," Geiger said.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clearly, pride was before the fall.
UBS employees are clearly remembering the holdings of leaders, on which Concerning Chief Wuffli repeated the same password: Snatch Goldman Sachs from the throne down.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank of the world.
She introduced "League Tables", a sequence that documented the success of the banks of that time.
In it, UBS tried to place it completely upstairs.
She's done a few steps.
In the deviation shop and shares, she participated in the games completely upstairs.
However, the entrusted advisors emphasize one weakness: in the international interest trade, in the language of the bankers "Fixed Income", there may be a great distance behind the biggest banks.
UBS probably has spaces in American hypothetical products.
In order to close this space, UBS was committed to an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Hungary after growing, invested both the bank and its founded risk fund in the American investments Subprime.
She developed into a powerful machine that transmitted valuable papers to American hypothetical loans and transferred, while he also kept risks.
Also, when the other banks have long been looking for an exit.
"It's still in the summer 2007 when the real estate market was in flames, there UBS was buying," said Geiger's bank expert.
How big the eurories are, so deeply falling.
One manager had to go after the other when attempts to clean up were more difficult than they thought.
UBS positions have become a catapulting seat, and until today they are hoping.
Now who runs a generos bank, he has almost unsustainable work.
They need to find a strategy for the bank that all close business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger has already got an idea: End of investment banking, concentration on property management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go this far (just yet).
But investment banking is to be strongly killed, that's how clear it is now.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present its future strategy to the world.

3500 scratches.
That's not enough.
UBS needs vision.
Who's wrong with her?
What does he want to make money?
These are the questions Axel Weber has already raised.
But in public, he's only saying that his lady will find her apartment first in Curych.
Next year.

Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places, ravens are placed field as "the birds of trouble," but from cities, these highly intelligent animals cannot be released, according to experts.
Some love them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: the crows belong to the image of the city for centuries, yet in some communities, they are gathering complaints of the inhabitants of uncleanness and noise caused by animals.
But it's not against "the problem birds" yet in the visual.
The hatrans of the field may not be released from the cities, the experts declared at the first symposium on crows in East Africa.
There, experts from the entire community have consulted on possible exits.
They're looking for alternatives in cities
Nature protectors also carried out the problems of the cities from the exode of particularly protected field ravens: The use of agricultural chemistry is about increasingly ruining traditional areas for life.
The persecution, the growing plant, and the cutting of typical trees for the nest of birds make life difficult.
The crows are protected.
Great colonies with over 600 nest couples are among others in the Westfall Soest, northwest, including in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Brem and Leer.
There the 2005 controversial project of mass killing crows in the rural district called negative titles.
The critics marked the catching of animals into birds' traps and killing the sticks especially brutal.
"Normal expulsion, fear, nothing brings," so much urbanist and landlord Werner Klöver found out of Leer.
The removal of the nests by scratching water or cutting trees has often undesirable consequences, also said Manfred Kaiser's environmental expert from Lahr in Badensk-Württember.
"The animals retreat, the great colonies stick and divide to other places."
Fear is thoughtful only as an exception in hospitals, homes of pensioners or schools.
"We have to live with them, we won't get them away."
Without the nearby territory, the problem of the cities cannot be solved, the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
The combination of expelling animals from sensitive housing areas and attracting them to sit in other places.
"Information tables instead of chain drinks" promoted the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different treatment of animals: "One heat in the face we can eventually stop with self-consciousness."
Mrs. Jürgens co-organized in Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg's scientific return path to which the information tables provide lessons about the life of a highly intelligent field crown.
The project is already accepted by tourists.
Also, Mrs. Jürgens had her own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by the bird: "This is about every volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
Intelligence and animal skills are legendary: The arrays are not only using a help to reach the pample, but even as a help they make their tools.
Researchers from Cambridge University have recently tested behavior on four field crowns, how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that the stones must bring the destruction of the construction so that they can get to the larva of the mole.
Without a great training, they recognized the size and shape of the stone must have to cause a collapse of the surface.
In the second attempt, the smart crows then had to solve a bigger problem.
In the vertically built war, researchers placed a small powder with a larva mole.
The birds couldn't reach their captivity.
Of course, the researchers put their wire in there.
She formed all four animal hooks that she used to hunt out of the tube for a holder.
Three of the four Polish Ravens even managed with a sequence.

But after the rest, the European Deputy Commander of 2004 made it clear with four hits.
Peter Jiracek ended for Czech Republic in 81 minute also the last doubts.
This is what the master of Europe leaves from 1976 to the fifth in the European championship.
The men of Coach Michal Bilk with the Legionist of Bundesligy Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomasz Pekhart (1. FC Norimberk) had also been lucky and had to overcome a terrible second at the beginning phase.
Branchar Peter Čech prevented reflectively at the last moment the possibly own branch of Tomah Sivoka ().
Black Mountain had its greatest possibility when Duo Stevan Jovetic and Damianovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired at 40 minutes from the border of the criminal territory only closely around the Czech gate.
After the rest, the restrained belly must have saved the place of the already slaughter of the Czechs of the world class, and the FC Soul attacker (50.) again declined.
The Branch made it clear shortly before the conclusion.
Turkey missed a football miracle from Zagreb at that time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul Turks did not cross the state of 0:0 in Zagreb.
While Guus Hiddink, national coach, almost surely has its place at the third lab at the world's world championship 2002, must relieve, Croatia is allowed from its fourth participation in the final circle of the European championship.
Before 31,000 audiences at the Maximir Stadium should have experienced almost a tale start.

Constantin Vassilev (57) balanced for guests.
Ireland has set a pace from the beginning, but it must have waited until 23th minute before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had his first good chance.
Only in the last minute, the Estonian defense prevented the possibly leading branch.
At 32 minutes, it was pretty far.
After the unsuccessful defense of the defender Paul Londonka, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball over the line at state 1:0.

Personal massacre
Emotionally strong new book Peter Englund entitled Beauty and mourning: The Confidential History of the First World War (The Beauty and the Sadness: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with such a long list of appearing figures when your head gets away.
One advice about how to behave at that time: Take this page out carefully and make a bookmark.
Because you are very well introduced to all the people in Mr. Englunda's romantic story and this list will serve you as a navigation - as a lightlight - in times when you will feel confused and lost in different situations as men and women in the story.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and a journalist.
He is also a new place at the Swedish Academy, which gives the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we're talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite properly, as an antihistoric work.
It contains several very famous names, important contracts or famous battles, but it is almost missing by Ambassadors, energy journalists and discussions on tactics and equipment.
It's not even a book about what happened, it explains the author, rather, "the book of what it was like," he talks about "feels, impressions, experiences, and moods".
"Beauty and mourning" combines war experiences of 20 less dozen men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanics to the hill, doctors, savior drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become war captives, lose ends, mad or die.
Their lives flip like the flames of candles burned in the church - new ones are joined in the fate compound, while others are extinguished.
The book of Mr. Englund is different from the classical historical novels.
It edits the idea that the first World War was just about horrible battle fights in the West Front.
"Beauty and mourning" also profoundly examines other places where war drama was carried out: Alps, Balkans, East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are dealing with the problem of falling on the bees of the nest, spending Christmas in the shadow of pyramid or dealing with the presence of much-tse.
Almost from the beginning, it is a very touching reading.
The war will absorb lives of people like some natural disaster, like a hurricane of Katrina smelling with a fire dust.
When the shooting from the guns starts in the distance, and you're the woman who's home with your children, will you run away or stay?
Who's actually coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on, even why the whole war was scattered.
"The vacuum arising from the lack of facts," Mr. Englund observed, "had been filled with allegations, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and fams."
"Beauty and mourning" watches stories of individuals, such as Florence Farmborough, English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are taken from the universe from biography, letters, and other published materials.
The descriptions of their lives may sound scary and bondful, but through the inclusion of small moments and details, they are completely alive and confidential.
Many of them talk about suffering and dealing with it.
In the story of the German students, the author says, "Replacements, all over the place."
"Coffee replacement, imitation of aluminium, rubber imitation, paper ties, wooden buttons."
He goes further and describes the replacements of food in Germany.
It refers to the "mass made of lissed rice cooked in wooden fat (and supplemented with false bone), tobacco from dried roots and dried potatoes, wooden shoes."
It mentions that there were "837 registered substitutes of meat in the production of coconuts and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
One American finds in itself internal populations for wildness and brutality, which is the war saying, "You will finally realize that this is human nature. Not sitting in comfortable chairs with cigarette and whiskey, evening newspapers or good books and pretend that this mask represents civilization and that there is no barbar behind that scratched me in the inside."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that with the greatest probability, he will soon die and no one will even notice that he would grieve.
"When a person finally agrees with sacrifice, he would at least expect it to happen before a grateful audience," he says.
Instead, he feels like a "convict he hangs secretly."
Other notes relate to the departure of old Europe and the occurrence of new horrors.
"Conflict has become increasingly economic competition and competitive fight," Mr. Englund wrote, "the war between factories."
He caught what he said, "new kind of beast of the century coming: an explicit and ideologically sworn mass killer in the clothing cut to peace that he does his bloodshed without getting up from the table."
People behave completely unexpectedly, subordinately with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch some sexual illness so that they could avoid service on the front.
"The most gross example of this behaviour was trade with a gonococco gnois that soldiers were shopping and shopping with it in hope of ending in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate people put him in their eyes, which often blinded them until the rest of their life."
In this Swedish translation from Peter Graves, the prose of Mr. Englund is swift, but it is not manifest, which is perfectly suitable for his human theme.
In the dozens of small outputs, the way the war "built uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start to ask why their leaders are forced to fight.
The best books about the first World War mostly worked with signs, such as "First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussel or Romans like "In the West Front of Peace" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most embarrassing completion that the popular scientific literature does not have.
But I won't give it to you.
But you will feel like the author suddenly jumped out of the book, pulled the page out of your hero list and burned it.
After the previous error this time, the precisely scheduled case for a minute
She participated in hundreds of police officers, some in the helmets used in street troubles.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the park Zuccotti should be almost empty at that time.
No one knew about the action except a few highly built officers, the other was first said it was a exercise.
The police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence emphasized how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
It was not allowed to repeat cases of the past weeks when, for example, the use of pepper sprays against demonstrators, thus violating the rules of separation and, in addition, the wave of sympathy to the public was transmitted to the squatter side.
This is why the police operation aimed at cleaning Zuccotti from demonstrators was launched until two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
The leaders have been inspired by operations performed in other cities.
The massive exercises for behaviour in crisis situations took place in Randalls Island, which was preparing for action in Zuccotti Park.
The leaders have strengthened the so-called training for disturbance -- anti-terrorism measures involving a rapid movement of a large number of policemen -- focusing on the city part of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River River.
The orders to move to the park were literally "on the last moment" declared by someone who originally had been explained only as "training".
"I know a couple of policemen who were also called to this action, and no one definitely said to them that they were going to Zuccotti Park," the person who spoke only provided that he remained anonymous.
"The fact that it was going to Zuccotti Park only knew the highest position of the members of the department."
One of the reasons for secreting was the lesson that the city had once received.
On October 14th, the city officials had to clean up the park, but then they resigned from the plan, because once the demonstrators heard of it, they included them before the operation started in the park for hundreds of people.
The Tuesday action was attended by policemen from various units, including intervention groups from around - dozens of policemen who are usually used to strengthen quarters with a higher level of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day he was coming to the park and leaving a lot of people again, so one hour at night was the ideal time to start the action.
"It was appropriate to do it when it would be in the park as fewer people," he said.
Before the units arrived, the Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge Bridge bridge, cars of emergency units with circuit lamps and amplions.
The lights and recorded report of the amplions frightened many demonstrators.
When members of the regular units entered the park in their blue winds, many demonstrators packed their stuff and left.
The police claim that until 1:45 in the morning, she didn't touch the only tent, so she wanted to give the demonstrators time to pack things.
Other police teams were observed as they gathered on the edge of the park so that they could get into it if there was a need for arrest.
The reporters were forced to leave the park.
The chief spokesman of the police department Paul J. Browne claimed that it was for their safety.
Many journalists, however, feel that the police were trying to prevent them from seeing their units in action, and, in addition, some policemen treated them grossly.
Mr. Browne argued that television cars on Church Street were able to record without problems along the west border of the park.
The police went in the Western direction, and the density of personal protesting matters, including luggage and igelite bags full of clothes, went behind them by teams from the hygiene department that immediately buried everything left in the park.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were pulled out of the park. Documentary image materials appeared a moment later on the Internet.
The most inhabited group of demonstrators stood near the kitchen in their camp, which was near the center of the park.
Some have created a bullet, and the police have launched their methodical arrest.
About ten people in the center of the camp have tied each other.
And two people tied to the tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency members were called to cut the locks.
Until 3:30 p.m., no arrest was held in the park, Mr. Kelly announced.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, and the police said.
Mr. Browne said there were approximately 142 people in the park.
The majority of arrests took place because of the "organisation of extremities and resistance in arrest," he explained.
Joseph J. Esposito, commander of the police department, was the highest uniformed officer in the department.
The surgery was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, detective commander.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he had not shared with the management of the operation," Mr. Browne said.
The second group of policemen waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between the streets of Liberty and Cedar Street, in case it was necessary to call her.
The street of Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and the street Pine Street, a block south of the park, were raised.
From these places, the police developed a protective belt even further from Zuccotti Park.
In one place, police officers were observed, many of whom had equipped shields, as they pushed people beyond this border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The most wildest night events went south of the park.
About five o'clock in the morning, a demonstration was observed south of Pine Street, jumping on the hat of the police car, and some other who released air from the tires of the police van.
At one moment, a piece of slippery flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protestant was hospitalized.
The Committee Union of Assistant Workers will sue the city for release
The committees representing hundreds of school assistants who have lost work last month are planning to sue the city in the middle. They argue that release was not necessary and that it was also discriminatory because of the unreasonable impact on schools visiting poor students.
The Court of Justice is likely the last option to remain to the unions in the area of the District Council 37 in their attempt to reverse the release decision.
On October 7th, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parents coordinators and other employees who belonged to among the most paid employees of the city. Their releases were described as the retribution of the city for the last spring had not been allowed to access the healthcare fund to managed workshops with which the city wanted to stick a hole in the budget.
The city's representatives категорically rejected this charge.
At the meeting of the City Council last month, the Minister of Education, Dennis M. Walcott, said that the release was part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the Council immediately contradicted that nowhere in the budget was spoken of exemption of subsidiary workers.
The representatives of the City District of the Council 37 announced that they have already completed the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would sue him.
Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education will be accused of the process, while the complaining party will be eight employees, of whom all are African Americans or Spanish, as well as most of the other assistants who have lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman of the city’s law department, said that the city had not yet seen a complaint, so it would not be made available to individual charges.
According to the proposal for the complaint that the New York Times managed to obtain, the committees focused on the quantities released in poor parts of the city to support their claims for unfair deeds, because they believe that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have been denied sufficient funds for a long time.
They pointed out that, while schools in Staten Island were not even released at all and in part Upper East Side only at least, in Brooklyn, section 23 of District in Brownsville lost 17 school assistants and parts of District 8 and 9 were released even 46 assistants in South Bronx.
Recalls that at the Public School 36 in Harlem, five of eight assistants lost their job, even though it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The complaint says, "It is not a neighbourhood full of mobile parents who can gain funds to compensate the deficiency in the budget."
The public school budget 36 was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way to calculate bonus finances for each poor student reported.
In addition, the Committees argue that the Directors of High Schools could be confused in the way that a document authorising the release of parents' coordinators was written.
The document used the word “excess” to describe the action, thus canceling the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the teacher's movement from the school's paycheck list to the database of available workers whose refund is paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parental coordinators were released," states in the complaint proposal, "and not only moved to the database at the position of available workers."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to accept a agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, the Republicans and Democrats in the Congress seem to agree on something about the rebellion in Libya.
However, before the revolution had to succeed, for a long time, the ruling dictator Muammar Kaddafi had to be captured and killed and participated in United States units.
On Tuesday, the Commission for the International Relations of the Senate will decide on the expressions supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCaine (Aris.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn) in which the Libyans should congratulate their successful rebellion and American units for their "freety".
"We want to appreciate the courage of the Libya people who have started reconstruction of their country," Kerry said.
"The two parties of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
The sentences mentioned may seem innocent, but no debate on Libya has been easy until yet.
During the summer, the lawmakers of both sides constantly argued between themselves and the White House on the change of a series of declarations for approval or the rejection of the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution allowing limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House because of the different views of both political parties, so it was never voted in the Senate.
However, the same day when this proposal was rejected in the House, the Chamber also rejected measures to stop the financing of American operations in Libya.
By this, an American mission in Libya was literally in a legislative clearance - Congress criticised the way President Obama managed the mission, but his members were obviously not so irritating to stop supporting him in his beginning.
The height of the Congress event eventually preceded.
The rebels won Tripolis in August, and on October 20th was killed by Kaddafi.
The mission was officially completed on October 31st.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission for International Relations in its statement "congratulates Libya's people for their immense courage and remarkable abilities made in their efforts to release their people" and "approves men and women of the United States' armed forces and their allies who have joined the Libyan population's operation for extraordinary courage and professionality."
The statement also "reaffirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and unreversed transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the Commission receive a new proposal full of support for international relations, or will the legislators be re-separated into two halfs, such as the approval of the June proposal?
Against the last version, Senator Richard G. Lugar (Inde), the Chief Representative of the Republican Party in the Commission.
Lugar's speaker said on Monday that the final version of the new proposal has not yet been seen.
In the Parliament this week, a supplement to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority of almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first supplement to the Constitution relating to the budget or other theme to which the entire House or the Senate will vote.
The other legislators have not yet been able to push their proposals to the vote itself, even though they have hardly tried.
Goodlatt's proposal is only one of 68 supplements to the Constitution, which were presented in the Congress and touched wide scales of different themes.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to the House and to the Senate - and others are only a small exchange of others.
Only in the House can be found at least 15 versions of the supplement on the balanced budget and another set of items that would like to "regulate federal expenditure".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their advocates -- especially the starting Republicans who want to improve their reputation -- can be praised by their "authorism".
The budget regulation approved in August requires that the Supplement relating to the balanced budget be voted by the Charter and the Senate.
In March 58 Senators voted in favour of an unbinding declaration to support the formation of such an additive.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to discuss the limitations of the periods in which members of the Congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods to be president.
The representative of Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a number of supplements that would guarantee, in addition, the right to quality education and medical care.
A permanent proposal remains an additive prohibiting the marriage of the same sex couples and an additive prohibiting the burning of the state flag.
Some legislators also want to allow the abolition of federal laws if two thirds of the states are against them.
Although members of the Congress seem to be very active in proposing different supplements, they do not considerably disturb from the average compared to previous flights.
In 111. Congress offered 77 supplements, while in 100 were 66.
Their activity is even bleeding compared to the beginning of the 1990s, where, according to the statistics, members offered more than 150 supplements every two years.
But they were not far more successful than the current politics.
The latest supplement added - the 27th supplement - was ratified in 1992, but, in fact, the Congress was designed in 1789.
"Beating but not defeated," said Gifford in her first television interview from the shooting.
Ten months after she was injured by the shooter at a public meeting with the voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Aris.) appeared on the state television on Monday night, she sang together with the melody from the "The Sun Will Come Tomorrow" show and announced that more than returning to Congress is worth healing.
Giffords appeared in the series "20/20" at the ABC News Station with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that the creation of a sentence still caused her problems and needed help in walking.
The whole show documented her difficult reconnalescence, which was necessary for the injury caused by a bullet that hit her skull in front, broke through her left half of her brain and went out of her head.
Three months ago, she suddenly returned to the House to triumphedly participate in the voting on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview from the January shooting, during which six people were killed and another 13 were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and singing -- and she described her recovery as "threatening".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, she answered the 14-year-old Giffords, "That's pretty good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the watch special of the series "20/20", which was transmitted in the evening of the publication of the new book of this couple, entitled "Gabby: Story of Courage and Hope".
The Specials have been watching the whole Gifford Reconvalescent since the 8th January shooting.
On the videos that Kelly filmed during the first week, it is seen by Giffords in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar over the whole forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can't do more at the time than just raise one or two fingers.
A few months later, Giffords was caught sitting in a wheel chair and teaching her how to perform simple activities.
Shuffling with your head.
Pulling the lips.
And then, her first word, "What."
During a few days, Giffords said another word - "toast", when she required changes in her breakfast.
Videos sent by ABC stations show that Giffords played a hard role in recovering music: Congressman is singing on them with a therapist on the song "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" from Cindy Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During the interview with Gifford, who spends two hours a day of therapy, Sawyer told her that she didn't remember anything from the day she was shooting.
Her husband said that Gifford read the paper articles about shooting until 12 March, when he first asked who was the six who was killed in the incident.
The suspect Jared Lee Loughner is being held in a prison in Missouri, where he is waiting for a trial under the influence of violent drugs.
"All people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Awful, horrible, horrible."
Kelly Sawyer said that at one point his wife said during the reconvalescence, "I lost."
"So I said to her right now, Gabby, you didn't lose," said Kelly.
"You've only got a loader.
But you can handle it, you'll get together and you'll come back even stronger than ever before."
Military units meet rather with compassion than respect
This event was a Wall Street gallacher who delivered millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who have no roof above their head.
Kid Rock sang a ballade about power, frustration and loss.
There were hundreds of soldiers, sailors, flights, and marines around him.
The gloriously dressed crowd rose up and was thrilled to shake.
"Mans and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who had produced spring benefits.
The celebration evening also attended the Chairman of the Committee of Heads of the Office, except for it, Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of military units a little differently.
"All were represented as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant that well.
I know it is.
But what I saw wasn't respect, it was pity.
Such contrary impressions only illustrate the difficult relationship between the army and the often measured, sometimes celebrating the American public.
The army is without the shore by praise for its sacrifices.
But this praise is worth something, they say soldiers.
The public acts more and more like she regrets the individual in the uniform.
"We are not at all victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the units in Iraq and soon leaves Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This theme is very sensitive to military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or to corrupt relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger they had to face once returning back from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most of the words of regret are made in silence and private between war veterans.
When two sons of the pensioned Colonel Mark Cancian returned from battle action where they served as members of the Marine Marines, their father warned them that the people outside the army would look at their service from two corners.
In view of some, he will feel respect and amazed because they defeated the enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
Others, however, will swing the head if "beneath the surface is not covered by the evil, violent veteran," said Cancian, who participated in the fights in Iraq and took place in Washington in the government after return.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some people who were interviewing him suggested whether he could resist the stress associated with work in Washington so soon after his return to battle.
"When you talk about your service, you must count on negative reactions," Cancian taught his sons.
The anxiety of the army is partly a source of American indifference to wars.
The achievements in the battlefield are only a few of the country's recognition that has only small awareness about its own army and in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan finds little benefit.
"As a nation, we do not respect military heroism as we used to be in the second world war," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded US units in Afghanistan.
Instead, the recognition of politicians and the public focuses primarily on the suffering of men in the weapons.
The soldiers are designated for the number of actions they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost, or for the scope of their injuries.
The army faces a growing pressure to strike hard against rape
This week it decides whether the trial of 28 women and men against the army will be initiated for alleged inactivity in the event of rape.
If not, they are ready to file a suit by hundreds of other proposers.
The first class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was reportedly raped by her colleague from the army, 25 years old, and she was pregnant in 11 weeks.
It happened in October 2008, and she was headed to the casaries on the air base of Miramar north of San Diego. After dinner with her friend, she ran into her male colleague bearing a 12-beer box.
He asked her if she could join her, so she could drink a little in her room.
"I got a warning light in my head," Lyman described.
But the birth Texasan completely ignored her objections.
I thought, "No, he's 19."
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
He claims that just a few minutes after they entered her room, the man went to her, threw her into bed and raped her.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other existing or former members of the army will wait for a hearing verdict that could have a historic impact. This will happen in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be about whether the charges against the former defence minister Robert Gates and his precedent, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought before court.
The accusation states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to fight the spread of rape in the army, which is in contrast with the constitutional rights of soldiers.
In February, however, the charge was filed by Washington's lawyer Susan Burke and the prosecutor had 17 members at the time. During the following months, their number increased to 28 to 25 women and three men who all claimed that they were raped or otherwise sexually attacked by their colleagues in the army and that the army failed after the notification of these attacks in the investigation, punishment and any prosecution of justice.
Burke claims he's following the neck of the highest built commanders of the army, because the problem starts just with them.
"The Army is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in position to avoid attempts to take action against such acts?
Burke also claims that since February, she has contacted at least 400 survivors, many of whom could become part of other complaints in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than to collect all the charges in this case - she put all eggs in one basket, as she says, - she will file complaints in more different cases, if it is necessary to prevent the pressure.
The Defence Department team is headed by the State Representative of the United States Neil MacBride, who, together with his colleagues, instructed the case to refuse.
The judicial documents obtained by Newsweek are detailed in the defence strategy - in principle, the current or former soldiers cannot sue the army for the injuries they suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to the Rules of the Supreme Court of 1950 called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is responsible for the injury suffered by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged injury concerns the military service of the prosecutors," the document states.
The Ministry of Defence refused to express this matter.
However, things have changed since the 50 ’ s.
Although women are still officially not allowed to serve in battle, it is only a wording: in modern wars only hard to find a clear front line.
In wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, women's troops played an increasing role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female gender soldiers fell between these wars - two-thirds of them directly in battle.
It's time for modernization in the army, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her struggle, but three other legal representatives are dealing with her.
At the Yale Law School, visitors of the veteran seminar on law services are preparing for four major military academys for alleged development of the atmosphere supporting hatred to women.
Despite this, the non-profit organization of American Vietnamese veterans collects grounds for its prosecution against the army. This suit focuses on the diagnosis of "personal violations", which was allegedly identified in the victims of rape to have a cause for their release - according to activists, such as Ana Bhagwati, belonging to the group of warriors for human rights Service Women's Action Network, it is quite common practice.
In December, her group filed a proposal for a complaint against a State organization for treaty with veterans accused of discriminatory practices to be held in processing requests for assistance by persons who claimed that they were sexually attacked in the service.
In the Congress, nine separate proposals submitted by a group of Senators and Members from both political parties and proposed a number of corrective measures.
According to the Prevention and Resolvation of Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defence, 3 158 sexual attacks were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains not reported in most cases and according to its own estimates, the number corresponds to approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated number of 19.000 incidents that occurred in the year concerned.
The report issued in March also examines the criminal prosecution rate of the suspects: 20 percent of the cases reported in the army in 2010 had reached the court, which is half of the civil justice system.
Prosecutors in the case of Deputy Burke describe the attacks only as the first of the whole series of traumas.
For example, the first class soldier Lyman reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after what was expected to happen.
During the night, she said, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape to 11 different members of the police, doctors and commanders.
All the examinations needed to identify rape and the blood of the attacker was found in her bed - from the wound she made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman's hearing was graduated before the court, during which she was questioned whether she had loved her friend on the day of the attack.
Six people were called to witness the reputation in favour of the alleged perpetrators who eventually had been released.
"I remember the day the sentence was sentenced," says Lyman.
"I felt like I was right there at the place of birth -- I ran out of the courtroom."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember that I said to my commander, "It wasn't his judgment, he was mine."
The Lymans ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed the personality disorder, thus identified it as a disadvantaged service.
In January 2010, she was released from an unhonorable army and therefore without the right to interrogation.
Whether the case of Lyman and other prosecutors moves to another stage or not, it's a long run, says John Turley, a professor of law at the Law University of George Washington.
Of course, he notes, "From my perspective, they should be able to move into other stages of discussion."
However, among them and the verdict is a doctrine that was criticised since the first time that the light of the world saw.
I'm a life criticist of the doctrine Feres Doctrine.
The army has been behind for decades because their obligations do not succeed in keeping the same level of motivating incentives and intimidating means.
He adds, "The chances are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
Only if good people are willing to fight.
If it is not decided in their favour in the hearing, Burkevoa, the lawyer of the prosecutors, will gather hundreds of other persons prepared to file a complaint and start working on other causes relating to this subject.
"We will not stop the army in this issue of fighting where there will be no reform," he says.
Or until we die, according to what comes early.
Walls have eyes: How scientists study you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became a new face of right extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-employment views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July's murdering rage, after which he remained in Norway 77 dead, attended his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could have acted alone, he was definitely not lonely in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time in the computer preparation, chatting with some millions of nationalists supporting the right groups on the social network sites.
After the tragedy this year, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - just go to Facebook.
"We realized that getting them is not really that difficult," says Jamie Bartlett, the chief author of the recent report of the British Research Team on the European Digital Populism.
The personal information in Facebook is so extensive, says Bartlett, that the scientists were just enough to use the ads on the site, and so they defined the searched demographic group - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team, across Europe, found half a million fans of right groups, focusing on them and sending them advertisements, but instead of inviting them into a new group or offering them some diet products, they called them to meet the questionnaire in which questions were raised regarding the level of their education, relations to violence and optimism in view of their own future.
By means of Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different legal groups in 11 European countries - without leaving the office at all.
"It's a completely new way of conducting research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: the on-line advocacy of the right groups are the universe of youths who push the growing rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, "the ones who combine their online activity and offline activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind the computer screen."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one of the examples of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, healthcare scientists and politicians use these pages to study everything, from health problems to social trends that cover up status updates, wall contributions and pressed buttons "I like it".
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each day in the average will provide three different information, which literally makes this social network "information supernova", which is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic work in which the Facebook word appears has increased against the state five years ago to nearly 800%.
For some scientists, Facebook's magic is giving them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"It used to be true that when you wanted to conduct an examination among people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should get into a side where they would never let you go," says Bartlett.
"It's all off the Facebook -- you're just going straight to them."
Others argue that the site can offer a way to identify the social and health problem and avoid them.
In a recent study, Dr. Megan Moren from the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who discussed their drunken performances on Facebook were much more threatened by alcoholism than students silent about this subject.
Morenov suggests that the students of the site monitor and offer help to a student who is publicizing too many drunken statuss.
"The problem cannot be resolved unless you can diagnose it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, a co-autor of Dr. Moren and Director of the Centre for Health, Behaviour and Children's Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We found a way to identify the threatened children that we wouldn't have the chance to discover otherwise."
Facebook itself constantly pronounces the data of its users.
The information team of the sites has developed statistics on the relationship status and on Valentine's Day, elections in 2010 and the coefficient of the national satisfaction (usually with the use of information they had access - the Internet freedom supporters have long claimed that the website should have its information treasure access to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching whether they like it or not - in exchange for the possibility to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site needs to provide personal information.
But what if the Facebook users become part of the research they don't even know?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect off-line data. However, online data are accessible to everyone.
"I think most users didn't even think scientists could look at their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist in London Knowledge Lab, on the 2006 study that he conducted with the use of public Facebook walls of his students.
"When it was for them, they took it in the way that the information was only between them and their friends."
Then it is also to consider the question of methodology.
Even when researching off-line, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
There is no way to verify how much information on the profile and contributions on the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you're doing outside Facebook are two completely different things," explains Selwyn.
That's why Selwin, who has spent years research on new technologies, thinks that the pencil and recorder continue to remain the best possible tool that can be used in research.
"When you go to the real world and talk to real people, it's something you can't replace," he says.
"Communical research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities still happen off-line."
Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public judicial receipt
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to launch two attacks, during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, during his first public hearing in Oslo, he described himself as a fighter of "resistance".
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and among the Norwegian templar knights," he declared before the court where 500 people gathered.
"I object to the court because the mandate has given you an organization supporting the ideology of hatred and supporting multiculturalism."
"I recognize my actions, but I don't admit any guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivika interrupted during this monologist because "he didn't want to give Breivic an opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could report his opinions."
For the same reason, he rejected Breivik, who brought a preparatory speech with him, to allow the end of the hearing to address his victims’ relatives.
Nesheim also commanded the police to keep Breivika in custody for another 12 weeks, banned any contact with the media for four tonnes and announced that the competent authorities would have complete control over all his visits and all correspondence over the period of eight weeks.
The hearing attended about 30 relatives and survivors.
Some came in hope that they would be able to look Breivic into the eyes, others to make sure he was held firmly under the lock.
They have all participated in moving the case towards a rapid closing.
"I felt he looked cold and inhuman," said the NRK commentator one of the survivors' attacks.
"It was nothing pleasant, but I can say for myself that after I saw and heard the suspect, I went a little further."
Breivik, in dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional all the time hearing. At the arrival and departure of the building without trouble with view of present journalists and survivors in the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre idea that he was part of a larger resistance movement, the judge said he was not crazy, and noted that there was no proof that he had a co-complice.
For someone, it may be a comfort that the attacks of 22 June seem to be the work of the only extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, it does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish it could look like a beast, but it's not," said a relative of one of the victims.
"If I did, it would be much easier."
7 Lessons from a lost conversation with Steve Jobs in a movie to the movie this week
Once Steve Jobs died on October 5th, the views of people who compared him to Henry Ford began to appear and chose him as his genius, the greatest modern inventor.
On the recently re-shaved Jobs interview, which was poured for a special film that is heading to the movie this week, all Apple fans will be the fact that his creative mind fully understood business processes and work flows behind its products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer and a self-named hippie member, but also a pedantian organizer and a man who put every smaller thing into the least detail -- he believed that many businessmen suffer "the idea that a really great idea is from 90 percent of their work... [but] between the excellent idea and the excellent product is still a long way of work."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show Triumf computer mads who discussed the dawn of personal computers. During the film, a unique, more than an hour interview took place.
At that time, Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and had full hands of work with his new NeXT computer company, and he was impatiently looking at how a wide public would accept the Internet.
In the television show, only a short part of the whole Cringely talk was used and the original copies of the interview was traditional that they were lost during the transport.
However, shortly after Jobs died, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
This material, mildly cut, forms the base of the 68-minute picture of Steve Jobs: The lost interview that is heading towards the selected movies this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who has spoken unwilling to provide longer conversations, Jobs is very surprised that he can talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And it also appears to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking when it is to see Jobs’ answer perfectly thinking to be the most precise and precise.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism is floating on the surface, when Cringely's questions are acting impatiently and inducing him to get to more important problems and topics.
The interview was recorded before the Pixar era, iPod or iPhone, and it appears to be scaryly prophetic thoughts when Jobs evaluate what other companies do well and wrong, offering his own vision of the future in the fields of computer techniques.
One thing is to read Jobs' post-mortal reviews of his career, but on Jobs, who we see here as a desired dreamer in the flower of his genius, is something raw and inspiring.
He has his own vision of how things might look and look.
It took not long, and after he said his thoughts, he also began to introduce them into practice.
Quick summary of seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which is definitely worth note:
How he learned how to manage:
"In the years of business, I've always asked, "Why are you doing this?" and the answer was the same every time, "Well, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does, never think about business things.
I found out.
Jobs continues by declaring his efforts to simplify the accounting in Apple.
He was totally confused by the way the cost was recorded - often started with the sign "standard costs", it could only be thought about their height. At that time he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that trade costs could be determined during a moment.
How he did the pope's barrel:
Jobs recalls the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to efficiently break into the phone company and call freely anywhere in the world.
The device has been written in the past, but Jobs’ enthusiasm, when the Blue box describes as a tool of power, is literally infectious.
It tells us how they tested the device with Wozniak using a pay phone and during the call they were allowed to reconnect from one AT&T network to another while using as many satellites as possible.
"We got at least half a dozen times this way around the world, so when we screamed in a pay phone, it called a minute later from the second phone at the door," Jobs laughs.
"We were young and we found that we could build up a thing that could be able to drive infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world."
We made ourselves a small thing that managed to control much bigger huge -- it was an incredible experience, and I think without it, Apple would never have come up.
Jobs continues with a description of the joke that they nearly reached to the end with Wozniak. By means of the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called to Vatican and asked if they could talk to the pope, making themselves as best as possible for Henry Kissinger.
The Catholic church members were gradually called to speak to an American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before they wake up to the phone even the pope itself, the two fell up and broke up.
How he fell in love with technology (and called with Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old and he was looking for replacements to build a kmitometer, he found a number on Bill Hewlett's phone list and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute conversation, Jobs had secured summer brigade in Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I've ever met at the time, and it formed my view of what a company really is and how it should be treated with its employees."
Jobs later became one of HP employees who visited the company research laboratory in Palo Alto, where he saw the "first desk computer ever made".
He was big as a trunk, he had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him right away.
As a teenager, I walked up and higher at HP, screwed around that computer and started writing programs for him.
How innovations invent:
In several places, Jobs talks about how they invent new products in the run.
At the beginning of his career, when he went to sell a few boards with general connections, one customer asked him to gather the entire computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days during which he had to invent, mount and add finished equipment.
Later, when he was in Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember having quite wildly argued... screaming at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost 300 USD] when I stopped having fun, I went out and found a designer."
90 days later, we could make a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How the big company gets breathing:
A long time before he led the resurrection of Apple, Jobs prophesied that many industrial leaders in his vision would collapse and lose their market share.
"Let's say you're working with IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better copies or printers, so what's next?"
You have a monopoly market, so society can't be more successful.
At that point, the reconstruction and marketing are already in place, so the companies are headed by people who are responsible for this, while the people who are responsible for their own products are being shocked out of the decision-making process.
Technological genius, which led to its insufficient position, is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - competitiveness and technical knowledge are necessary.
That's exactly what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have owned literally the entire computer industry.
She could have been ten times bigger than she is, she could be Microsoft in the 1990s...
But instead of winning, they made a loss.
How he takes innovation as a form of art:
"It's still a long way and a lot of work... and as the great idea develops, it's changing and growing."
During that time, you'll learn a lot about him.
You have to join a number of compromises - certain things are just electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You must have 5000 things on your mind all the time - different concepts - and put them together...
Finally, it depends on the taste - you're trying to think about the best things that humanity has ever created, and you're trying to make it a certain way of trying to make them in what you're doing yourself.
Picasso said good artists are copying, but the best artists are stealing.
I've never been ashamed of robbing the best ideas.
The Macintosh company was so amazing and successful because people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, history and coincidence also the best computer experts in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, they would have done amazing things in completely different sectors.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opponents of the Healthcare Act when their case was dealt with the court.
On the day the Supreme Court seated behind closed doors to discuss a politically controversial question whether he would accept an objection to President Obama's healthcare law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a festive dinner sponsored by a legal company to participate in the trial.
The event occurred last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the proposals.
One of the cases discussed was the complaint filed by 26 States that questioned the radical treatment of healthcare approved by the Congress last year, the law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed that the complaint would be heard, but in March a 5.5-hour negotiation is expected, which will further develop presidential elections planned for 2012 and will be in full stream during the decision.
A lawyer who will stand in front of the court and endeavour to reject the law will be most likely to be Paul Clement, who served as a general prosecutor for the United States under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's legal company, Bancroft PLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies who helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society group, which has been defending conservative legal principles for years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations of doubting laws, called the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which there are huge funds in the process.
The dinner was held in the Washington hotel a few hours after the trial on the subject of the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the highest representative of the Republicans in the Senate, and the contested opponent of the Healthcare Act.
And the introduction of guests?
This is nothing new: these two judges have been participating in the federalist group for years.
And it's definitely nothing that would be contrary to the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempted from the obligation to follow the principles of conduct under which lower federal judges are subject to.
However, if not, their behaviour would definitely fall under the principle of C4, which states that "the judge may participate in actions that are currently related and other organisations in order to gain funds, however, the judge must not be a speaker, a honourable guest, nor be introduced to the action programme."
However, the relationship of Scalia and Thomas with two legal companies effective in the case, as well as companies with enormous financial interest in this case, had enough to warn the activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference against the code of conduct is in contrast with the claim of several judges that the Supreme Court acts according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause organization.
"The judges drank and had dinner for social benefits with legal representatives waiting for their case to be discussed before the court."
Their presence and assistance in acquiring funds through this action undermines their legs with all claims of unemployment, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little understanding against their critics and told them that they also combined their judicial obligations with actions of groups such as the Federal Society.
Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a highly built conservative activist.
In addition, Conservatives suggest that the ethical problem has mainly Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia with Thomas.
Kagan worked as a general prosecutor for President Obama's government when the first objections against the law came before the court.
The Critics of Kagan pushes her to deny her involvement in the case, and claims that she fought for the law so much that she could now be unemployed.
Kagan didn't mean she was going to retire.
Boeing received a record contract for aircraft worth 18 billion USD
Airlines Emirates order 50 two-way aircraft Boeing 777 with a possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner airlines to Aman Air, for which it incases more than 1 billion USDs.
When a company gets a order for 50 pieces of its products, it is usually no reason to celebrate.
However, if this company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 aircraft is combined with the records of 18 billion USD, it is something different.
Similarly, the important report is where Boeing received the contract: the Middle East, growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to the predictions issued on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2 520 airlines worth $450 billion in the next 20 years.
The Boeing announced its biggest order in history on the dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 biennial Flower Boeing 777.
The senzational order came from the airlines of Emirates residents in Dubai.
Boeing at the 2011 Dubai Air Show announced that airlines are able to buy another 20 aircraft, which would result in the total value of the procurement of 26 billion USD.
On Monday, Boeing announced that the airlines Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, sometimes also called Dreamliner, which is proud of much better fuel consumption and passengers.
The total price of these six aircraft exceeds 1 billion USD.
"One is a great report for the whole Boeing company," Neal Dihora, analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the nations of the heavy oil.
This means not only that they have money to pay for aircraft, but the rise in the price of engines - mostly damaged airlines, because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so crucial because the country itself earns oil at higher prices.
This is important, because they are not as likely as in other airlines that they could convert or postpone the orders of aircraft because of the increase in fuel prices, Dihora says.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
Emirates' procurement for airlines strengthens Boeaing's leadership on the market with a wide body and brings to close airbus SAS that tried to distort Boeing Boeing's dominance with its A350 transport model.
The winning of Boeing comes four months after the airbus representatives announced that the first flight of their largest A350 aircraft, which is a direct competitor of the aircraft 777-300ER, will take place.
The departure took place because customers demanded greater useful loads of the aircraft and flight, so the manufacturer took time to add the engines to the greater power of the engine.
The cost of Boeing Co increased by 1,5% to 67.94 USD.
The Mexican President's sister was allegedly defeated in the Michoac elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Valleion, from the PRI, helped hunting for the governor's chair with drugs.
The sister Felipe Calderon seems to have lost the position of the governor in Michoacan in violent state elections. On Monday, she later declared that one of her opponents were helped to win.
The preliminary results have contributed to the leadership of the governing elections of the Western State Faust Valley of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The attacks of members of organized crime in the entire election process and especially in the last day of the elections are alarming not only for Michoacan, but for the whole of our country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview day after Sunday elections.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the public opinion group... entertaining the election urnas, building road bargains... and letting people vote in order for the Pri.
The Pri Party has ruled in Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when the presidency was lost.
However, it plans a rapid return to power and victory in the elections in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
The PRI Party hopes to win in July in presidential elections.
Vallejo seemed to beat Calderon, which led a day before the elections, just very closely.
Calderon, a conservative candidate for her brother's National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Valleyon as a winner.
The third was Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left side of the Democratic Revolution Party, or the PRD, which has yet controlled the governor's office. For reasoned and unfortunately, the persecuted party is in front of the presidential elections in 2012 about a very unfortunate loss.
Aureoles also refused to recognise preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of the state called Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to recognise the results.
Michoacan has been controlled by drug cartels specialized for marihuana, heroin and metamphetamines for a long time.
This is the birth state of President Calderon, and in Michoacan in December 2006, the war fight against traders was launched.
However, violence continued.
The mayor of the PAN, Luisy Marie Calderon, was murdered only a week before the elections, and many candidates of the elections have gone away from fear.
However, whatever the results of the elections in Michoacan appear to be for the PRI party, winning the party will help gain a new impulse.
The expected representative of the PR party in the presidential elections, Enrique Pena Neto, congratulated Wahington Valley and said, "I think this victory could be very encouraging for the next year."
ADB Bank calls upon Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank called on India and China to be prepared to help save the Eurozone from its serious debt crisis, otherwise it could have a total decline in the world economy that would have a negative impact on the growth of the economy in Asia.
Rajat Nag, Director-General of the ADB Bank with the residence in Manile, said that two of the fastest growing economies in the world must "do whatever they can" to help rapidly recover the monetary block through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned the Bric Group [Brazilia, Russia, India, China] of all European difficulties are watching "too unexperienced" and said that Asian financial assistance in combination with European leadership and funds would help blur the long-term decline of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who could help Europe in the crisis is suitable," he told the Financial Times during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia may be protected to a certain extent, but she is definitely not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do."
The European Monetary Association has been difficultly tested for a serious debt crisis for months.
In the last days, the loan costs of Italy have increased dangerously, and the presidents of the Governments of Italy and Greece have withdrawn.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that the global economy could retrieve the recession and the calls have started to be called to link new leading economies and help the Eurozone find solutions.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be directed through IMF, but he noted that mutual aid - such as the purchase of debts to the European Union financial aid fund, the European financial stability institutions - would provide more negotiating opportunities for Asian partners in the European countries.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do whatever she can" to help the Eurozone, because its own economy is now suffering from decline in exports and drying the flow of foreign capital.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and unstable," he said.
"We are standing before a difficult task and we have to keep high growth."
"It's not an alternative, it's a naked fact, because how else we could find employment for dozens of millions of our young men and women."
Others suggest that developing economies, such as the Indian, have nothing to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be very difficult to explain the assistance for Europe for 1.2 billion people in India when 800 million of them live from 2 USD or less per day.
"Once they could find out that the Greeks are retiring at 50 and enjoy vacation on the beaches, which would probably be hard to explain," he noted.
Lee Howell, Director-General of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why Indian supplies should be used to maintain well-paid employment to many Greek citizens in badly managed and loss sectors such as railway transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis was threatened by the "dangerous dominant effect".
The bank's forecast that between 2011/2012 in Asia 7,5% of economic growth will be faced with the "risk of decline" due to the European threat.
He declared that vulnerable developing markets must create "plans of unforeseen expenditure" to be protected from decline and significant capital flows from their economies.
Pentagon's warning about possible defence scratches
The Minister of Defence, Leon Panetta, on Monday in Congress, correctly put it under the kotle when he warned that the automatic cuts in the budget can threaten national security and cause a financial chain response starting in Pentagon and continuing through the battlefield in Afghanistan to civil mounting lines.
The Pentagon will have to spend a reduction of $450 billion in the next ten years, but it is now afraid of a reduction of $600 billion, unless the Congress concludes the expenditure agreement.
"The impacts of these cuts would be destructive for the entire resort," Pantta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the unableness of the Congress to reach the budget agreement and that the so-called obstacle would cause 23% of the standard decline and stop many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction used in this unreasonable way, most of our construction or ship projects will not be able to be performed - you cannot buy only three quarters of buildings or ships. Besides, there might be serious damage to other modernisation efforts," the Panetta wrote to the Senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is going to run so fast, we will also have to almost surely send civilians to a coercive vacation to be able to meet the target requirements."
"Those changes can shake with the faith of those who care for our army and seriously damage her readiness."
Finally, the cuts will also touch the battle units, he announced Pantta.
"Although the accounts for the financing of possible military operations in the invasion are not directly touched, the operations there will be negatively affected by serious changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"It will also occur in the contractual staff, which will result in the delay of contracted contracts supporting the war effort of our people."
"The states of payable employees will be reduced, which will also result in delayed payments to suppliers and subsequent violations of legal and political support."
Both Senators cancelled Pant ten days ago and asked him for details on possible impacts on automatic defence scratches at the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequences of the defence ministry could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military force."
"We are strictly against this hard measure," the Senators announced in the joint statement on Monday after they published Pant's letter.
"It's not about the conclusion we could live with, and we definitely don't want to sign it."
"The planned cuts are a threat to national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"It is only to see if Pant's letter and fresh warning increase the pressure on the Congress that approves the budget and strengthens the votes calling for leaving the Pentagon from the list of distorted areas.
The Panetta has recently been opener in the interviews about possible scratches, even though he himself has moved to his high position in Pentagon with long years of experience with the approval of budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was running into a hard fight.
At the press conference held on a minute week, the Minister of Defence indicated a brief picture of what his resort can wait - a shell of the army, but within which the core will be missing.
"He'll be like a ship without the sailors."
"He'll be like an ammunition brigade."
"He'll be like aircraft without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like the army of casarens, buildings and bombs without a sufficient number of trained soldiers who could complete the mission," Pantta said at the beginning of the Pentagon speech.
"It'll be like an emotionless unit, unprepared and unable to deal with a possible enemy."
"As a result, he'll be welcomed to aggression..."
In the Annex added to McCain and Graham Panet, it sets out how the reduction will result in "explicit operational risks: late responses to crisis, conflicts and disasters; significant restrictions on the possibilities of elevation and planting around the world; the predictable unacceptable risk in future fighting operations".
Furthermore, the Panetta added that some of the largest defence projects could be expected to be terminated, including those already tested, and those that are only in early stages of planning.
For example, the project F35, planned new bombarder, the balistic submarines of the new generation, the new coastal battleships and the new land fighting vehicle, which the army and the marine marine troops wanted to replace humvee.
By stoping further development and testing F35, 80 billion USD would be saved during the next 10 years, but its advocates claim that it is a necessary further step in improving the army, which is necessary for the country to address possible threats by China and other rivals.
How to recognize a lie
A long view of recent newspaper titles suggests how serious and everywhere lies and lies in daily life are.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has full hands of work with the accusation that he sexually disturbed several women - both parties claim that the second lies.
The managers at the University of Penn State were accused of a false testimony when they tried to hide records that a pensioned football coach sexually attacked the boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was captured, as it was told by the launched microphone to the US President Barrack Obam that the Israeli President of the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie was able to destroy all the careers and stable the stability of many countries.
The New York Congressman and the Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made himself a fool when he published the information that was immediately withdrawn by uncertain evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of abuse of finances from his campaign to try to hide his unmarried relationship.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that ripped around Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period of his sexual interference with Monica Levin.
It's all about cheating stories at school and university.
There are cases when teachers give their students test answers only to make them look good in their judgments.
Mentors who should teach the opposite are sending the message that lie and fraud are acceptable.
How many frauds do we meet?
Studies show you're lying somewhere between 10 and 200 cases in one day.
Suppose many of them are mercy lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times during the first ten minutes of their first meeting in their life.
Determination of lies, or "recognition of lies", is the necessary skill that everyone should be able to gain for personal or job reasons.
However, this is no social game that would be similar, let's say, Sharada, when a person shouts: "I have you." Recognition of the fake is a serious science sector working with scientific data collected during the past six decades in prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths of lies were distorted.
Liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're screwing, cocking, red, or shining.
Nonetheless, do not make it difficult to observe and disclose liars.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from the vibrant building, the small expressions in the face, the way of creating questions and their time.
I spent a few years gathering scientific knowledge from a large and developing facility relating to determination of lies and it is clear that the discovery of a lie is a modern skill that you can easily learn and in today's complex world can help you very much - especially if your jobs include employment, interviewing, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them sink in caution, direct their emotions and intuitively realize how the other party accepts them.
From research, we know that extroverts lie more often than introverts that men say more "self-centric" lies, while women call more lies "focused on others" - mostly because they protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than free people (but they say, mostly are "unsensitive").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
It's called "beginning observation."
He will have later findings to compare with what.
Note the holding of the body of the subject, his laughing, the voice work.
You should know if someone always knocks his feet, so that you don't unlawfully accuse him of lie only because he starts to knock his legs in the middle of the meeting.
Then try to determine the concepts of false verbal and unverbal behavior.
However, consider it only as warning signals, not as evidence of lie.
Lying people can stop moving the upper half of the body when they try to remember their invented story, the top shoes can turn to the door, swim to the east, significantly change the holding of the body or show "relief after the end of the conversation" - excessive breathing and changing the position when a difficult story is behind them.
People performing interviews often issue a false signal that the interview is at the end, just to see how relief will look after his end.
Beware also the language of the subject.
The famous story is about how Scott Peterson once broke himself and used the past time when he claimed that his murdered wife was alive, which led to a full search of her body.
The deceptive individuals can also express themselves measurably: "I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Levinsk" or a difficult question they will repeat.
The most common verbal signs are only very minor.
Someone can use a lot of "slowing tongue" when he answers the difficult question, "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... according to my best consciousness."
In such an answer, we do not know too many facts and often it is another warning signal.
There is no spell that can be revealed by any lie, but it is possible to gain skills that can be detected by a lie.
With these skills, a person will have a greater chance that he will not fly to a liar and a fraud in his personal and work.
The controversial plan for the construction of oil pipes will be transmitted after the threat of the delay of approval by the American Government
A few days after Obam's government threatened to defer the approval of the planned oil pipe from Canada to the Mexican Gulf - by putting communities against itself, but calming environmentalists - the company with the building of pipes has announced that it is willing to redirect the project to move again.
The TransCanada announced on Monday night that it will move the planned route of pipes from the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is convinced that the project will be approved anyway.
The company notified this decision at the press conference in the headquarters of the Nebraski government.
The TransCanada column Alex Pourbax claims that the company is convinced that the construction of the pipes will eventually be approved, although it will guide a different route.
This notification came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week declared that it defers a decision on the federal authorisation of the project from which it would not conduct a study of possible replacement routes that would prevent Sandhills from interfering in the area of Nebraska and the water layer of Ogallala, the wide underground water supply.
"This is really moving forward," said the Republican representative Lee Terry from Nebraska for Fox News.
The new ecological assessment ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably resume any decision until 2013, thus a year after the elections in the next year, however, the authorities refuse to play a role in the decision.
In his written statement last week, Obama described his decision as a request from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and expressed his support.
The 1,700 miles long pipe will connect Canada and the Mexican Gulf.
From Alberta's province to the raphineries in Texas, he's running 700,000 barrels of oil daily.
This way, six States will need to cross.
This project is completely hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by workers who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear at work on the pipe.
However, the lawmakers in Nebraska have set up against this plan and considered the introduction of laws that would make the company not interfere in the Sand Hills region and in the water layer of Ogallala, the main source of drinking water and elaborate.
The existing study on the environmental impact ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would only have a small negative environmental impact, but the source of energy industry said that the inspector-general inspector from the Ministry ordered a new review of the entire original study process and focused on two issues.
One day, whether the Lobbist, who hired TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a consultant of Hillary Clinton in 2008, did not represent a conflict of interest in the programme.
Furthermore, whether the company which was hired for the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of vomiting the screwed up because of her.
The New York family claims that Patti LaBelle's singer singed up awfully into their Manhattan house and frightened their daughter so that she was frightening.
The exit of the hit "Lady Marmalade" scared the 18-month Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personal change, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of foreigners," says her family in the lawsuit filed to the Manhattan High Court.
On November 10, last year, Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a teacher in the school, and Genevieve were about to take a family trip.
When Kevin Monk landed the car, Roseanna Monk came down to their house's baggage in the Riverside Boulevard part and carried Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped at the door for a moment and put her baby away for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind my back and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said "yes" and I left to pick her up."
Labelle irritated the pregnant woman.
"Aggressive tone she told me, "You shouldn't put your daughter at the door," Roseanna Monk said.
"I said to her, "I don't care about your opinion."
She was pissed off and started talking loudly - she screamed the lowest expressions...
She had a bottle of water with her, and she started pushing water out of me.
He claims Genevieve had a hysterical attack.
"I told that woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
Labelle was on her mother - who still had Genevieve - threw her in her arms - and had to stop her until her escort, which then dragged her into the waiting car, told Roseanna Monk.
Meanwhile, the daughter screamed so much when she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter in which Labelle asked for apology, but they had no answer.
The lawyer and speaker of Labelle's singers do not respond to our calls so they can speak to the whole cause.
The complaint requires closer compensation but family legal representative, Sam Davis, that he took the case free and that the family plans all condemned money to devote a charity organization dedicated to cancer children.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to accept her responsibility," Davis said.
"This behavior is completely unacceptable, especially if it is targeted against a teacher from school holding an 18-month child in arms."
Climate disadvantage has reduced the economy
During the first year of the government, Maria López Valdeze increased unemployment and unreliableness in Sinaloa, foreign investments decreased and economy with them
In 2011, it is the first year of the Government of Maria López Valdeze, which is called the Government of Changes. This government has brought great expectations for economic progress, however, because of the inadverse climate conditions at the beginning of the year, no growth has been observed and even the decline of the main indicators of economic development.
Low February temperatures caused millions of losses in the field of agriculture, reduced the growth of the state economy, reducing economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year. In the field of agriculture, a historic decrease of 31.16%, which has broken the dynamic and other economic sectors.
According to the report on the damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damages were recorded on 582 835 hectares of land processed, of which 78.03% have been completely destroyed and partial damages have been found in the remaining 21.07%.
The decline in economic activity has resulted in a continuous increase in unemployment in the state by November. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the level of unemployment in the state has been recorded during the first three quarters of increased growth. From January to March 55,053 people of the State of Sinaloa, which represents a level of unemployment of 4,53% of economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5,28% and between July and August, average unemployment continued to grow and reached 6,19%, which represents approximately 74,000 unemployed people.
Less Liquidity
For unemployment during the year in the state of Sinaloa, more factors can be explained. According to Gerard Löpez Cervantes, the Director of the UAS Economic and Social Science Faculty may explain indirectly, on the basis of the steps carried out at the public policy level.
"We are witnesses of increasing unemployment, which relates to various factors, among them is the loss of liquidity on the market because of the restriction of resources due to the legislation approved by the Congress in the fight against laundering of dirty money. It is not easy for people who are illegally enriched in dollars to earn, invest them or use them for something," he stressed.
Suspension of migration
Lopez Cervantes stated that demographic factor is also involved in unemployment growth.
"The number of people who go to work for abroad, to the United States, has decreased, however, because of the reasons of an inadequate entry and then because even when these people get out of the border, it is difficult to get job for them. Thus, people stay and require work from our state, and so unemployment grows," he said.
Incompliance
Analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa also deteriorates because of the growing insecurity that prevails in the field of work. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of employees in the state work without taking the doses of the social security management.
Other features of the labour market, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and independence. In this administrative territory, the lowest wages from the country are listed in the Mexican Institute for Social Security and the Secretariat of Work and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa was deeply under the national average of 7 375 pesets by September.
Reduction of direct foreign investments
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the increase of unemployment in 2011, the highest decline in foreign direct investment has also been recorded in the past 10 years. According to the Ministry of Finance between January and June, direct foreign investments of $630,697 were achieved by 87,74% compared to $5,143,312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State invests 17,280 million pesets per year. These investment were mainly directed to services enterprises.
Debt
In connection with the economic decline scenario, the Government of this state requested in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesso, which would be intended for investments in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas to restore the economy. The local congress approved a loan of 2,600 million pesos. No debt profits were recorded until November, in no sector of state economy.
Reaction
According to the representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government, Maria López Valdésa, pointed out the lack of governing government capacities.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, chairman of the National Transformation Industry Chamber, declared that in 2011, the will of individual sectors, including the government itself, was missing.
"The growth of the economy in Sinaloa was really small during this year. We need to work intensely on getting back the land that we lost this year. In 2012, we have to double our efforts, lacking harmonization of the efforts of all of us and especially the right and synchronized functioning of this new government. Let's hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economy slowness
Loredo López said that events such as freezes at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and limited its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement has been caused by a number of events, including freezes. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy that did not recover quickly enough to restore dynamicity that would enable us to achieve the acceptable levels of movement of processes, products and services. Therefore, at the end of the year, we have experienced deeply under the expected forecasts," he stated.
Re-determination of the mission
According to Theodor Salazar Uriarte, President of the Officer of the Mexican Confederation of the Republic of Sinaloa, it is necessary to push the state to more dynamic productive activities.
"We generally observe that we are working. We believe that a long-term plan should be prepared to re-define the objectives and economic directions of the State, because it is important to mobilize all the potential of the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
Work that's in front of us
The President Coparmex emphasized the importance of identifying the vision of the future that would better manage the efforts of the government.
"I would generally say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, some progress have been made in economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He stated that the current administration has shown progress in the governance of public policy.
"There are elements that allow the government to claim that the government is trying to be convenient. I can say that there is a work done here and I think the government is aware that there is also a lot of work before us," he said.
Condemned for 8 kg of marihuana
The Citizen Navato was sentenced to five years of prison and 100 days penalty for holding eight kilos of marihuana.
The General Prosecutor informed the Republic that the convicted dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted for a crime of health threat, specifically for holding marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 at a meeting at Cipriano Valdez Street, opposed to the station 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
Dealer drove up white colors in the van of type. In his car, he had a black bag and a small bag on the seat of the rider. The soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marihuana.
For these reasons, the secured man remains available to the Judge of the Second Division and the procedure remains internal within the Centre for the Legal Effects of Crime.
Dutches contributions to projects
Social projects that are part of programmes such as Habitat, Public Rescue and 3x1 for migrants are facing the danger that they will not be brought to the end or that they will have a great delay because of the missing economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of urban social development has stated that if construction work has been progressed so far, it is now threatening that the government of the State will not be able to provide appropriate supplies that require funds of more than 11 million pesso per three programmes.
He stated that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesso. The state appears to be 25%. Only the Federations and the city were added to work until that time, so it is possible that the projects will be delayed.
"They have to provide nearly 12 million and even though the year is coming to the end, we have not got anything, even though we had to get a piece in July," he said. "To not waste our time, we started and continued very long, but we missed the money."
He stated that in last year, the State did not fulfil the supplies of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, so at the beginning of the new period, the city had to ask for a loan so that more than 7 million had not been paid by the government.
"The same thing has happened to us in the previous six-year period, because the state has not had economic capacity to participate and programmes continue. To get to the programmes mentioned this year, we have to get funds that would cover what he had not finished," he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a pledge from State representatives on the transfer of these resources, he stated that the request to Armand Villarreal, the Secretary for Administration and Finance, was sent to the Secretary of Finance to speed the proceedings and the corresponding percentage arrived as soon as possible.
"They were supposed to provide us 12 million and even though the year is coming to the end, we have not even got a pesso."
The Court approves "the end of analogical broadcasting" in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analogic signals is one of the most important changes that the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional lawsuit submitted by the Senate and the Ambassador's House against the Presidential Decree, which wishes to speed up the so-called "out of analogic signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
The minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juana Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderon did not exceed his powers by issued a decree that set out individual steps that would lead to the transition to the earthly digital television.
This result was rejected by the complaint filed by the Senate because the qualified majority of eight votes were not achieved so that the court could express itself to the constitutional or inconstitutionality of the mentioned decree that remained valid.
The proposal for the judgment made by the Minister of Olga Sanchez Cordero presents the possibility of pronounceing a decree as non-constitutional, because regulating all issues relating to radio and television is a matter which, according to the law, is reserved by the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel).
Only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Members supported the constitutional dispute in trying to fight the decree. The Ministry of Sanchez Cordero accepted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described in it, leading to the transition to digitalization.
The ministerial meeting also decided to reject the complaint filed by the Ambassador's House without taking into account a discussion on the proposal that is also in charge of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his presentation, the Minister stated that he did not identify the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal execution cannot structure through the general standards of measures to prepare public administration.
"I don't think that even if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is a federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The replacement of analogic signals is one of the largest changes that the world has experienced in recent years. It is related to the better use of the radio spectrum, the better quality of the signal and more channels.
He believes that dismissal of the change would mean distracting the benefit of digitalisation, which requires decisions in the matter of public interest, because digitalization is not just a technical dimension, but "she also affects economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he emphasized, these questions "require the operation of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, includes a number of competences that the Constitution is entrusting to the Government of the State".
He recalled that a number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to the digital system and have done so through their governments, even though they had highly specialised technical authorities.
He stated that it is not possible that the government, by issueing an inappropriate decree, which is to a certain extent interfering with the area of the competences of the Congress, has introduced in the field of administration to comply with the laws prepared by legislative powers.
In Michoacan, they analyze the possibility of compiling "glass by voice"
According to the data published by PREP, the difference between the first and second elections of the governor is less than 27 per cent. No votes of 879 of 6074 elections have yet been calculated.
The possibility of compiling "vote by voice" appeared in this year's elections in Michoacan, where, in accordance with the statements published by the Preliminary Election Programme (PREP), the difference between the first and the second seat in the Governor's elections of at least 27 per cent has not yet been recorded by the votes 879 of the total 6074 electoral counties.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute in Michoacan (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that several days ago, on 9 November, the Election Authority approved a number of measures to harmonise local standards with the Federal Electoral Reform.
As it will be recalled, Michoacan has not officially confirmed his political constitution or its National Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Act. The State Congress has approved reforms shortly before the legal period for their entry into force in this election period, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel recalled their publication in a specified period in the Official State Journal that he had any objections against them.
On 9 November, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative power and declared the vote of the head of the State in the constitutional reforms as "incorrect and illegal" because he has no right to "allow or vet".
On the question of the possibility of compiling "glass by voice" María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that by approval of the relevant measures, the General Council of IEM will be able to perform partial and general electoral computation by the local electoral authority.
In this way, a partial summary of votes, one or more electoral packages, will be possible under the following conditions: the election results do not agree; there is no record of the computation of votes and the calculation in the corresponding field or is not available by the Chairperson; or if there are errors and apparent violations of the electoral results.
Furthermore, the total recalculation of votes in all election urnas will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential winner of elections and the candidate in the second place is smaller or equal to one percentage point; when an explicit application of the representative and/or the coalition that proposed the candidate in the second place appears at the beginning of the session.
The total recalculation of votes will also be possible when the difference between the probably winner and the candidate in the second place is equal or less than one percentage point and when there is an explicit request of the political party whose candidate ended in the second place. In such a case, the electoral packages with partial computation will be deleted.
It should be mentioned that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and second place of less than 0,16%, even though 129 of the total 923 elections have not yet been compiled.
His last will
His ashes will be dispersed in the mountain of Zapalname, confirmed by the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. During Monday, the celebrate ceremony and the respiratory Mass will take place.
According to the family, the colonel's final wish was that his ashes were dispersed in the mountain of Zapalname.
Once the family Bacio Cortése, along with the others who died in the accident, received the highest honour, returned to the capital city of Coahuila on board of the Mexican Air Forces. The family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
In the afternoon, the Colonel's ash arrived in a chapel in Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family and friends also came.
At 5:30 a.m., a good-bye was held at the Technological Institute in Saltillo, organized by his former students from Technology School and members of the American football team, Felipe Bacio, who was also a member during the graduation preparation.
"He wanted to return to Saltilla and his wish was that his ashes were dispersed in the mountain of Zapaliname. This is what he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the top of his life, "this was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a lovely brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young and entered the Aviation School Collegio del Aire in Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said that even the truck was driving, but he always went to his dream to become a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "he barely arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahagun to Saltillo."
A young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapatan at his uncle’s promotion, so he is convinced that he died in his favorite life: aircraft management.
They gave him the last goodbye.
Felip Bacio Cortés, a colonel of the Mexican Air Force, said goodbye to all the honors that he came to give to him governor Jorge Torres Lopez, citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the only Mexican Air Force, the leaders and students of the Technological School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he was in the study and sports.
Bacio Cortés died in the last days after the helicopter fell, who was driving. There was also a government secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora, and another six persons, all the officials of this state.

Three abandoned dead body were found on Cadereyta NL ship.
Several hours before the findings, military representatives presented the media of 11 persons detained in this area for crimes related to organized crime.
The bodies of three men killed by shooting into different parts of the body and head were found on the abandoned ship of Cadereyta Jimenez, Nuevo Leon.
The road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level known as El Castillo, was found on a mile from Cadereyta to Santiago.
People who were moving in these places noticed that a chamber with a bee-coffee fence had opened doors from time to time.
When they looked in, about three meters away, they noticed three people’s dead body, and they immediately warned the authorities.
One person had a sports shirt of yellow color and dark cotton pants and was not shoeed. A man also lied in a sports shirt with white stripes.
A few meters further was the body of another person dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three were lying face-to- ground.
According to the data obtained in places, all three people were probably murdered elsewhere because no bullets were found.
The board of the cabin was found messages addressed by one group of organized crime the other and a number of bullets, both to build and on the door.
11 suspects were arrested in Cadereyt.
The National Defense Secret presented 11 persons, including youths, who were members of the criminal group, especially in the area of Cadereyta, which was associated with kidnappings, murders, persecution and illegal funeral.

They were accused of illegal funeral in general Terran, China and Cadereyt.
Wednesday a new Italian government will be appointed
The appointed President of the Government, Mario Monti, will tomorrow meet with the Italian President to present him a new government that will face the crisis that holds this country over the ruin of the economic disaster.
The appointed President of the Government, Mario Monti, will tomorrow meet with the Italian President to present him a new government to face a crisis that holds this country over the ruin of the economic disaster and puts the whole euro area in danger.
The Presidential Palace issued a report in which he announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Georgi Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could create a government.
The government is expected to represent a complex majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government is taking power.
Monti declared that he would present the president's results of his conversations with political parties in an effort to create a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told the journalists.
Monti explicitly did not say that he would be able to create a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well marked," he added.
Monti has completed the government's creation process in less than three days, which is much shorter than usual. In the meantime, Italy is trying to fight political and financial crisis, which has led its debt to an unsustainable level.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Montim must approve a hard package of savings required by European leaders, and only so it will be possible to renew the broken confidence of Italy.
Monti's high pressure has been developed to hurry. For the instability of the markets, the interests from the Italian BTP bonds with a ten-year fee of 7 per cent boundaries, the level where Greece and Ireland had to ask for salvation.
Emma Marcegaglia, chairman of the Italian Employer Organization of ConfIndustries, told the journalists after the Montim meeting, "We said we'd be very supporting this government."
We believe that this government is the last option for Italy to get out of this intense situation.
Monti's hope for success has been significantly multiplied by the support of the PDL Silvia Berlusconi, who has forced the crisis to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are determined for good results," she told journalists Angelina Alphano, the secret of the Mediterranean Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is important, because until this time, a number of its members were contested against the government with the technical majority of Monti.
Support for Parliament
The new government of Monti must have strong support for Parliament to promote unpopular savings reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in a given effort could cause a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks joined the pressure and warns that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monti started negotiations with political parties, unions and business groups, youth and women on Monday.
The bike ends Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed President Napolitan on Sunday, which allowed a very quick process in response to the crisis.
After a short decline from the end of the last week, when it was obvious that Berlusconi would demiss, the interests of the Italian bonds returned to the critical border and responded to the uncertainty of whether the new president of the government would make success.
To save Italy, whose public debt is moving at EUR 1.8 billion, would be beyond the possibility of current euro area financial reserves.
Monti declared that his government should endure until the next elections planned for 2013, despite the general forecasts that claim that the politicians only give him time to make reforms and then announce early elections.
Monti pointed out that he would like to integrate policies in his office, but the major parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to bring Italy out of the difficulties that the country has gotten into because of financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that both untrusting and disagreement among the parties complicated the attempt to integrate in the government and political personality.
Spain participates in international matches more often than the Costa Ricans
Of 22 Spanish footballists, ten will cross the border of 50 international matches.
On the side of Costa Rica, only one of 22 caucused players came to a number of 50 matches.
The giant contrast on the side of Costa Rica, if we compare 22 players of both countries that met at a friendly fight today at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world champions and Europe, number one of the monthly FIFA ratings, have a wide range of inter-electoral matches in class A, Kosta Rica has only the defence of Michael Uman, who was the only one who played 50 international matches.
This number reached last Friday at the Panama (0-2) stadium Rommel Fernandez.
The Spanish footballists who play in the Falls of Stars and in the powerful clubs of the English First League, maintain intense activity over a year at League Championships and home cups and high-level fights within European cups such as Champions League.
We also need to add experiences from the national Spanish team in the complicated rivals on the European and World Championship.
Kostaric players have very limited options for foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, Concaf, which is considered to be the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign combats from the Spanish representative has on its account a Brancher Éker Casillas, who last Saturday before England (the loss 0-1 in London) reached an ex-brancher Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international fights.
Casillas will also enter today against Costa Rica and get a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernandez, the key player of Barcelona, has 106 matches on his account.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced last week, together with other Spanish players with hundreds of matches on their account, including Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle attacker Schalke, Raoul Gonzalez, with 102.
Carles Puyol also approached hundreds with 97 fights.
Follow Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fabregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and close to Michael Uman, the left wing of Junior Díaz is moving with 48 matches and Branchman Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Furthermore only 5 overcome the border of 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santi Cazorla (32), ALVARO Arbeloa (31) and Raoul Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches Roy Miller stands with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest didn't even cross 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Kostarice Victor Bolivar only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are waiting for their first match.
The best shooter of Spain is David Villa with 50 goals and follows Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rica side, Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Kvinteto included the country in its tour at the occasion of celebrating twenty years of existence
"The road to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes real."
In an exclusive interview for Viva, the Jeff Ament Basist of Pearl Jam said that the group is ready to offer one of the best concerts on the National Stadium next Sunday.
We waited for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that the possibility to play in Costa Rica represents a dream fulfilled for them.
This is what the Basist and the founding member Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively to Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent within the tournament at the occasion of celebrating twenty years of existence and on Sunday 20 will be at a unique stop in Central America.
This day will be performed since 19:30 at the National Stadium with the Angel Group The X and national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an illustration from the interview that you can find in the La Nación website on the Internet.
For your Costa Rica, it's a dream fulfilled. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans experience?
The road to Costa Rica is our dream that becomes real.
In South and Central America, we were barely twice, and experiences were excellent.
It's a beautiful country and I believe we can stay here for a few days.
So we are so happy that we can bring you our music.
I ask, because they literally love the group here, the fans experience these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your greatest fans?
Thank you for standing with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica.
Some people speak of the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that cause you more pressure?
Some of the biggest shows we've been showing in the last 21 years have been formed in the horizon for several weeks.
We showed a few great shows in Sao Paulo and hopefully we got into the form for a concert at Costa Rica.
Actually, we're looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we like surfing, we like jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and her waves fit to surf?
We have a lot of surfing friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends are going to surf in Costa Rica or to Nikaragua, or to Mexico. These are the best places to surf, and so we learned about Costa Rica, through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you've prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we have no limitations that we can't do.
We'll try to show the best show with various songs. We'll try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans a good and different repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes other songs, so it's hard to choose which songs we play every night.
When we have two three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played for a long time, we focus on them and we are also surprised, because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten about it.
So the show is more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
This tour you celebrate 20 years of artway.
If you look back, is it hard to believe everything you have done?
Yeah, sure.
First of all, I think none of us could imagine being in one big rock group and staying in it for more than 20 years, that sounds like a dream.
We realize how much it has been given to us and feels that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we like to make music.
We're lucky to see the places we've always wanted.
We couldn't get better.
What meant to you that you were an important part of the generation of grunge?
We have always been honored to be part of this group in which they are represented by the great ones themselves.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when the movement comes from a group of friends, it's not often happening.
From time to time, a group will form in the city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to rise from one city at once.
We're proud of it, and we're honoured to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we play with some other.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on the tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honoured to be part of this movement that came up in Seattl.
It is also very unusual that a group like yours keeps together and that they still have the same members after those years.
Yes, we four have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) has joined us 13 years ago, which is already much longer about ourselves than the usual duration of the group.
I think for the first time we all are lucky that we are still in this world and the second part of our role plays the fact that we're constantly interested in each other.
We are all close friends, and so we managed to open musical paths that allow each one enough freedom to experiment.
We believe each other, we appreciate the music of another, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship with the word of glory was not easy, but thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, we gradually became more eager to find balance.
We try not to go too much on the tour, because it's very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for music, you will remember that you have to respect the music and what you gave it. You must not let yourself abduct by being famous, rock stars. This has never really been interested in either of us.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we were writing great songs, and at first, it was something great.
As a band, we existed for three years and we never gave any album until Andy died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us. When I listen to some song or look at photos, I remember Andy how amazing he was, how I laughed with him. It was always joyful working with him, laughing, talking about music or soccer and many more.
She was an incredible person and we missed him very much.
The National Group of Las Robertas will be authorized to start a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as jumps?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals, and we liked this group most, so we're wondering what Las Robertas offers alive and must be very funny.
Why are you always changing Yellow Ledbetter words alive?
That's the question for Edie Vedder, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he adds the first one to attack him.
Who's affecting you as a basest?
A lot of people.
I was first attacked by Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk about the Basites I like all night.
How did Pearl Jam keep the grunge, even though it's no longer in fashion?
I think we've always felt easy to separate from the word grunge.
When it comes to grunge, I imagine groups that I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all the other people that came up in the same time. And if music is so valid today, it's something great, because it's music worth listening and groups like Mudhoney today play better music than ever before.
At first, your music had a slightly dark nature and now it's more positive.
What's behind this change?
That's interesting, because I feel that there's a couple of tracks in the new album that are lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe, which are considered very dark, even though they can sound positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them to me, I cried, and it's deeply dark.
I think when you grow up and you have some trauma in your life, you lose someone from your family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs for me represent this.
I also think you can be a happy man and still make a dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was re- hospitalized for medical tests
On Tuesday, former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital where he would be tested because of the muscle loss suffering from the lower endpoints, his medical doctor informed him.
72-year-old Fujimori, who has been deprived of 25 years of imprisonment for violations of human rights committed by his Government (1990-2000), suffered from several diseases, including the cancer of the language, which has been operational four times and have the doctors currently under control.
Ambassador Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, said the Canal N TV station that Fujimori will be testing in the National Institute for Neoplastic Diseases within three days, where they should find out why he is hurting and why he was losing powers in the lower ends.
Aguinaga said that according to his opinion, Fujimori could have mercy for humanitarian reasons, however, the former president himself does not want mercy because he feels innocent.
He was operational four times because of the tongue cancer, dropped 18 pounds, and other problems were added to such problems as severe erosive gastritis, cysta on sline, kidney stones, high pressure and circulation problems in his feet, said the doctor.
Fujimori has been dismissed since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was convicted to 25 years of prison for the death of 25 people killed by the killing eskadra of the army acting illegally in the first years of his government.
Mujica visiting Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation led by the Uruguay President, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and entrepreneurs, begins to visit Mexico on Tuesday. Its aim is to achieve the expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch the political themes of the region.
Mujica will meet with its Mexican Proteisk, Felip Calderon in Wednesday. It is the most important meeting of a wider visit with political, trade and representatives of the Uruguya community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan presidential office.
The meeting of both presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political matters between the two countries," Uruguay presidential office published on its website.
According to local communications, Mujica will try to force Calderon to support Uruguay in a dispute with France when the French President Nicolas Sarkozy incorporated the South American country to a list of tax paradises at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkoza threatened that countries that will continue to remain in the position of tax paradise will be excluded from the international community. This statement has caused a rejective opinion by Uruguaya and consultation with the Ambassador in this European country.
Mexico President G20 since November. G20 is a group created by the most powerful developing and developed countries of the world. The Latin American country has concluded an agreement on the exchange of information to prevent double taxes since January this year.
The Uruguay Government has been endeavouring in recent years to concrete fiscal exchange agreements with a view to getting from the "black list" of the Economic Cooperation and Development Organization (OECD), which are countries which have not introduced all the required international tax cooperation standards.
From a trade perspective, Mexico and Uruguay have concluded the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which strengthens the exchange of goods between the two countries.
The beard installer runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been intimately struggling for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the spoils of the evil Bowser, but he has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of girls with stereoscopic technology.
The title that arrives this month in all shops around the world has been created from the beginning to use all the characteristics offered by the Nintendo 3DS transmission console that allows you to play three-dimensional games without using glasses.
"Mario is a figure that must tell how to work stereoscope without glasses," said the press specialized for Nintendo in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game Nintendo created specially for this carrier" because until this time, successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptation of already existing titles.
The Nintendo speaker stated that other than the picture is 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and flexible party.
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", which is the task of attracting less managing users.
Once you overcome this level, you can go into the "second round" at the levels of games that are more difficult this time.
Furthermore, users can choose real time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of action. But it will be necessary to play in 3D to overcome the various challenges and "do not be subjected to optical lies".
This new input of Super Maria in 3D also assumes the return of the figure to the transmission console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays note to those who watch and repeat the successful formula from previous parts. It is that the beard man's installer will have to pass dangerous mine platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in movements, in the area, in clothing, and also among enemies, Luigi also appears "play" in Luigi.
Colom approved the issue of Portilli to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he has taken steps in the issue of former President Alfonse Portil, who is to respond to conspiracy in the United States in order to launder 70 million US dollars.
This is the end of a process aimed at answering Guatemala to the request of the northern country that requires the issue of Portillo so that it can be judged.
At the press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judicial and executive power and that he remembered that the criminal court had already ordered the issue.
He assured that during his mandate he "no" interfered with the court decisions and allowed all the editions that had reached his desk.
In addition to Portil, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be issued for murder and severe health damage and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's step means an execution step after all judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted in order to lead the trial against the former president who ruled in 2000-2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after its legal situation in Guatemala will be resolved and guaranteed compliance with human rights.
Portillo was found innocent in the case of fraud of 120 million in the Ministry of Defence during his presidency. This process was preceded by the issue, but the Ministry of Public Revocation revoked and returned the case to the game.
Trinius helped 6000 young people in the state of danger
The organization formed to help the children without education to avoid being at the edge of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the existence of the organization of social support of Trinius is very important: 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion have received assistance. The organization has been helping them overcome the difficult situation for 25 years.
This should be added to a long hundred jobs that have been obtained for this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary also helped to present a balance within the accommodation act that took place in the former production sites of Fabra and Coats and which attended more than 300 persons.
In 1986, the Triniova organization was established in Trinitat Vella, with a view to helping young people with low education, without work, dealing with drug addiction or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
A large number of representatives of organisations and institutions attended the meeting in San Andreo yesterday, who have cooperated with the association in the past 25 years.
A variety of political representatives, during elections, showed the united nature of the work that Trinius performs.
Together with President Generalitat, Arthur Mass, and his precedent, Jordi Pujol, the former socialist advisor for education, Ernest Maragall, and the former mayor and the contemporary ecological and socialist council Richard Goma.
The Fabra and Coats also delivered the current advisor for Social Prosperity and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of Social Work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mass said that Trinius had emerged in a very difficult time and that today, too, has a number of obstacles, but he added that the work that the association has brought to this day is a good foundation.
The President stated Trinius as an example of how to combat the ugly circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is not for this organization and for the work he does, nothing new," he said.
There was a relocation of an employed house in which giant partys were held
Inhabitants owned 11 out of 13 apartments in a building in Balmes, 51
12 occupants left the house yesterday at noon without resisting
It all suggests that the nightmare of the neighbours from 51 in Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people volunteered yesterday at noon to leave the building that they were illegally living and where they organized giant parties that were awakening the neighbours, leaving the building from the court order without having to interfere with the police.
After the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent the repeatation of the situation.
"The entrance will be watched from now on," said the manager.
The occupants who took 11 out of 13 apartments in the building - the rest are resident - took all electrical and partially and water equipment, painting walls and left waste all kinds, especially alcoholic drinks.
In the first three apartments there were huge parties that took up to two days and wake up other renters.
There's a discoteka near the building, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europe Press that since the building was busy, markets fell by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque emphasizes that the occupants of the building were making her somewhat competitive because they were selling drinks for 3 euros, and it was worth 10.
Furthermore, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors because of noise, but the problems were not caused by the visitors of the discothectic, but the people of the hired house, and especially those who attended the partys that were held here, whose frequencies and intensity have increased over the past weeks, according to the disturbed inhabitants of the area.
The owner of the discotheque explained that the problems were so large that they even agreed with the building owner and for nine months she forgives her rent.
The city police also confirmed that over the past weeks they received more complaints from the neighbors on the situation.
The Chairman of the City Group of the People's Party of the PP at the Council, Alberto Fernandez Dijaz, last week demanded that "the building be immediately relocated and thus ended with the problems of civil collaboration suffering by the neighbours and the destruction of the area".
The Chairman of Humans explained that only one floor was prevented in the summer, but in the last months the occupants got into all the floors of the building and nearly all apartments, and in one of them even had been robbed.
In this direction, he added that "needs to end the punishment and to be consistent with the acts against civil liability that occurred in the building."
The city police also cleaned up the building in Nou Barris yesterday.
At 1530 minutes, the police got into the building 35 on Mont-ral Street after the neighbours who saw her enter the building four people.
All four were immediately detained.
Park or mountains?
The architects gathered on the occasion of an exemption of a procedure that brings more than a dispute about the fees.
The City Election Procedure at 16 gates again opens a debate on the role of the Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-80s, during the largest flower, the Corporation of Metropolitan de Barcelona (CMB) already disappeared, this management printed several pamphlets to support the Collserola park.
The plane defined the mountain as a big metropolitan park of Barcelony.
Furthermore, it was complemented with a number comparison with the New York Central Park.
After CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the top border of Barcelona. The Catalan metropole is one of the small ones that are not oriented to the axis north - south, but up (hore) - down (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park goes this way.
Because the reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wildlife instead of the bear Yogi.
This was the position until September, when the city stated the mega competition of 16 audiences for the same number of gates in Colsserola.
The gate, of course, records the idea of the park.
Either this or someone's trying to put the gate on the field.
So the only question is: Colserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, as from a purely organic perspective, and on the basis of the city's reflex, this question becomes the central theme of all Barcelonean architects.
It's already as shattered as if two members of this old casta chosen in the elevator meeting.
And this act caused one of the rare coincidence between what three Barcelonean architects think and the more prestigious university professors.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: Election Procedure has its justification.
According to Roldan after the issue of the bay party, "is necessary" to discuss "horse side", so the expression of Ildefonse Cerda on green apples was not reached to the end.
"We must be based on the principle that the most diversified Barcelone Park is the beach.
Besides, it's a great availability.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect for which the name "free to Collserola" is "lexicological trap," we cannot imagine it as "as entering the park, but rather as the definition of the zones where it can be operated".
Modol, like Roldan and Bayona, with the experience of urbanism, qualifies the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with a "some danger".
The danger resulting from the "insecurity presented today by the public place project" after the 1980s experience that had "his singing lab" in the area of the Forum.
The first concern is the limitation of the borders where it should be built.
"Something to define means to make another step," it is essentially to move a step further.
"The new urban and planning tools must be remembered, because these current (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM) can cause a real disaster."
If we focus more on the question, Modol thinks that the valley scroll of Collserola can be considered "park", but the Barcelona part is not, for the reasons of purely topographic.
The Modol also recalled that there was already a job done by Patronate de Colserola, which "can't end up on the garbage", even though the Council welcomes the fact that the Council offers its graemics that it will interfere with the project from the "first time".
In addition, it understands that the nearness of the mountain and town is some kind of a passage that allows the architects to engage in the debate, but "he doubts" that this should be just this technical profile that leads multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills", he adds), which is necessary to create: "Architects should be only instruments".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that has given the name of this game is complex, because there is a lack of a global vision of Collserola in the electoral proceedings: "It has been announced 16 election procedures which dealt with all the axis of the mountains - the sea, but there is no long-term study that would look at the area and understand it as a whole."
This causes at least him to join all 16 electoral procedures.
Otherwise, the project of one gate can inject the concept and definition of the architect of the neighbouring gate.
According to his opinion, the Council should guarantee that the zone located directly above Rhonda de Dalt should secure the entire area of equipment that would ensure a gasway crossing between the city and green.
Casino excused Jonas Larrazabal to be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the Legislative Officer Cadino Red granted mercy to Mayor Monterrey's brother in the process in which he was pursued for alleged extortion.
Manuel Jonas Larrazabal spent 72 days in prison and now will be released after the Legislative Officer Casino Red granted mercy to the Second Criminal Court in the District, which discussed the extortion case in which the brother of Mayor Monterrey was charged.
Following the assassination of Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photographs and videos on which Manuel Jonas had to ask him to pay the economic quota to allow the city of Monterrey to operate illegally in the betting house.
After the public prosecution, the State Prosecutor launched a criminal prosecution of the brother of the Panist Mayor. On September 2, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
Then, after 4 hours spent in front of the Agent of the Public Ministry, number 3 for property crimes was transferred to prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the capital city of the State.
This is where the following 49 days remained after the second Regulation was issued and the Agency of the Ministry of Public Refugees reversed the possibility of cooperating or organized crime.
On October 19th, he was transferred to a criminal court in Cadereyta for suspicion of blackmailing the owners of Casino Red by a amount of one and a half million pessoes. However, he remained only a few hours in prison with medium hard supervision, because he was threatened by death.
The leaders allowed him to stay in city cells in San Nicolas de los Garza during the process.
On October 25, he was given an order to arrest, issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yanez, who declared that nearly two months after the investigation, there was a gathering of sufficient evidence to prove Jonas' guilt. For example, evidence includes the payment of the amount of 1,5 million peso to the casino representatives in exchange for the promise that the operation would be allowed.
This Monday, the Legislative Officer of Casino Red, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez, delivered to Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the brother of the mayor of the region.
During the legal negotiation with the representative of the Ministry of State, appointed to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez whether damages were corrected and who of the companions decided to grant mercy.
On the basis of the official record 197/2011, legal mercy is granted to Jonas Larrazabal. There will be no complaint in the process that has been conducted against him. It is also impossible to request damage or punishment.
After receipt with a legitimate authority about 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yanez, came to prison in San Nicolas de los Garza to inform Jonas that his official mercy was granted and his case was deferred to the archive.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate provision for his release.
The secretary Dionisio Perez Jacome presented details about the air accident where the governor, Francisco Blake, died, and seven others.
The Secretariat for Communication and Transport (SCT) informed that the results of the investigation of the accident in which the Secretary of Francesco Blake Mora died and other seven people show that the helicopter was directly affected by the full-force terrestrial, without having the chance to try forced landing.
At the press conference Dionisio Perez Jacome, the Secretary for Communication and Transport, stated that the pilot had concluded that climate conditions allowed flights before the aircraft were launched.
"The parts that appear to be indicating that the unit has arrived in contact with the field several times, the wings have connected into the tree branches of 25 meters from the place where the unit lost the body."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it fulfilled all the requirements for the transport of staff.
Furthermore, he noted that no parts on the ground were found on the basis of the investigation carried out in the area of the attack.
"In search, it was found that parts of the plane were not located elsewhere, so the plane struck into the land as a celisty.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 persons, satisfied all the requirements for the transport of persons.
The terrain shows a scroll of 7 to 30 degrees.
The secretary assured that at the moment the most important is to get the results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take a few months or a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Support Services, declared that at the time of the crash, the presidential headquarters had a travel speed and an accident occurred in a soft elevated field.
"That information supports the hypothesis that during the accident it was a regular transmission operation," he said.
At the press conference, SCT Perez Jacome named six basic points of investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the airlines, the flight has been implemented under visual flight rules, which means that the crew must see on the ground during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM report indicates the adequate conditions for launching, in accordance with this, the plane is heading towards the border, and the scope of the clouded layers between the DF and the State of Mexico were seen in low heights.
Selected routes:
Probably because of the dark crew, the crew was looking for a lower area and a greater visibility to the Cuernavaca Valley.
Place of stroke.
The co-ordinates of the crash and the last record of the helicopter from the radar are consistent, it is likely that before the crash there was no loss of control or disruption of the flight trajector.
Distribution of the remains of the aircraft in a limited territory:
The information that we currently have is available allows us to assume that the crash occurred on an equal trajectory and from the side.
The plane of the remains of the aircraft suggests that the helicopter was integral at the time of the land attack.
There was no fire or explosion recorded.
There were no evidence of the explosion or fire at the scene of an accident.
The latest results of the investigation show that there could have been several contacts with the land.
During territorial work, the remains of the plane were found at up to 9200 feet above the sea, the area is considered to be above the slope of seven to 30 degrees.
Fotografies show recordings that are likely to break down along the mentioned route.
Information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could contact the country in several places.
Following a careful search in the area of the accident, in a area larger than the territories of expulsion, no remains of the helicopter have been found, which strengthens the presumption that the crash occurred in the state where the helicopter was still incompatible.
The Mexican Health Insurance Institute has launched gene research that causes obesity
The Institute for Health Insurance is conducting research in order to discover a gene responsible for the abundance of children and teenagers. The study is conducted with support of experts from the IPN Institute
The Mexican Institute for Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it has been conducting research in order to reveal a gene that causes obesity in children and young people. The study entitled "Genetics of obesity in children and youths" will enable you to gain the results of overweight.
In the report of the Head of the Research Medical Unit in the field of Biochemy from the National Health Centre of the 21st century, Miguel Cruz López explained that a multidisciplinary team composed of doctors, sisters, food experts and social workers was established.
This team is based on the support of specialists and students of postgraduate study from the National Public Health Institute (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnical Institute (IPN).
The research can also be included in a wide public, which has or has no permission. People can come to the participants with IMSS sports centres in Valle de Mexico, where every youth council will be tested for 8 hours.
He emphasized that research began in the Cuauhtemoc Sport Centre (Mexican State) and since 8 October, this activity is also carried out in the Nezagualcoyolt Sport Centre (East of Mexican State).
Once data are obtained from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue in the Independence Sport Centre (Južno from the Federal District) and eventually in the Morelos Sport Centre (Northern from the Federal Centre).
He explained that the aim of this research is to identify the components and the importance of genetic development of obesity, and to track the risk factors in Mexican children and young people, preventing chronic degenerative diseases.
At the occasion of the International Day of Diabetes, which is celebrated on November 14, he recalled that the aim is to collect data from three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and oversight of parents, for the application of specific questions on nutrition.
The questionnaire will also ask for physical activity and family analyses of inheritance diseases to avoid risk factors that may cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney insufficience.
He stated that each Saturday all participants perform anthropometric measurements (weight, height, passport), blood pressure measured, glucose levels, triglicerides, cholesterol, insulin and genes are studied (seek to identify genes that are participating in child obesity).
Cruz López stated that this research reflects the concern of the healthcare over the alarming growth of child weight.
'Health surveys carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that only in the course of six years, there were 77% increases in obesity in boys and 47% in girls. The dramatic growth also occurred in the case of overweight,' said the IMSS expert.
He stated that one of the reasons for searching for indicators is that the population of the country is different from the other populations of its genetic history.
He informed that the average Mexican has 65% of Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This is reflected in genes responsible for diabetes and overweight.
He explained that generally, the genetic of obesity is generally explained as incapability to burn the excessive energy that we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they are given a total appraisal of the status of children, so as to find out whether they have some famous overweight or obesity.
He stated that even the presence of dark color waxes (acantosis) on the neck and prelocation indicates the probability that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-sugar conditions.
The information is still confidential, the doctors transmit it to their parents in writing and explain all the measurements and changes in their lifestyle to avoid illness.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, massiveness and other chronic diseases: seating lifestyle that means the lack of daily physical activity, the full-day seating before television and the use of vehicles instead of walking on short distances.
The overweight also causes a large caloric income, this is a larger consumption of sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fats and proteins and genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
In Asfalt of UNAM, there will be no exclusions
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the UNAM Chemical Faculty creates modified asfalts with polymers and thus creates a mixture with better functionality, regardless of climate conditions and temperature
If it was properly taken care of duration, it would not be necessary to fix nearly 200 thousand bullshits after each rain period in the Metropolithical area of Valle de Mexico, Rafael Herrera Najera, a scientist from the Chemical Faculty (FQ) from UNAM, who also added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt liabilities were adequate, there would be significant limitations of the motion, or even it would be possible to be completely removed.
In his lecture, the Technological cause of the embarrassment that he made during the International Year of Chemicals, he announced that the laboratory under its leadership develops modified asphalts with polymers, which should create a mixture of similar characteristics such as asphalt, but also greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Najera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climate, for example in some cities in the northern country.
He explained that asphalt, the hardest part of oil, is the coupling of hydrocarbon molecules, the molecule with a large molecular mass called asfaltens, and others with a low molecular mass called malteneses.
The viscoelast nature of asfalt is that at high temperatures, approximately 180 degrees, it acts like liquid, at 120 degrees has high viscosity and at 50 degrees is almost in a state, while at low temperatures asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that asphalt resistance in the streets is not united, but changes during the day under meteorological conditions and temperatures, noted the expert on chemical engineering.
The Chemical Faculty Scientist observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de Mexico are covered by an flexible plate formed by six layers of material, of which three last are mixed with asfalt.
Among the top layers is the asphalt cartridge, made by small stones filled in asphalt and then compressed.
He emphasized that every stone that forms a cartridge is filled with asphalt.
When cars are passed or pressured, it is possible that the forces in the plate are well distributed.
If it was a modified asphalt, it would be even better, the chemical engineer believes.
He added that the asphalt cartridge is placed on the last layer called a coat, made by gentle stones, which is also a sand filled in asphalt.
Since this layer will be contacted with the cartridges, it must have more mechanical power than the asphalt cartridge and must ensure the wiring of the cartridge.
As part of the lending will be exposed to a large burden, the coat must have sufficient fat and must be careful about the material made from which it is made.
The climate, especially moisture and temperature change, is also an important factor that needs to be remembered. In particular, the water has a great impact on the functionality of the asphalt cartridge.
Once the ground is wet, the water is spreading inside and it's hard to get out, it causes softening all layers of plate and thus the rise of the bullets.
He explained that during the generation of molds, the first film will be destroyed and then the asphalt cartridge is damaged. But it does not occur at one point, but it is a slow process that should be stopped by the first marks using appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National Scientists' system, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the creation of molds, and that is why the fatty of each single layer of the plate must be consistent with the load of vehicles and must be guaranteed that this burden will not exceed, and only so we can prevent the frequent formation of motion.
Rafael Herrera warned that asphalt is still waiting for us, and research is at the beginning. For example, asphalt emulsions that are already available on the market in other countries are easy to fix the edges without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing the Valle candidate to become a new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that contributed to Melina Ramirez Serna has not obtained Miss Colombia's crown.
That's how Valle gets the 14th title of the first multimiss.
Valle del Cauca hasn't reached Miss Columbia's crown again.
Melina Ramirez Serna had to be satisfied with the winning scene, obtaining a silver crown and a sharp based on which it became the new multimiss Columbia.
On the basis of the results of the last final in Cartagena, in which the conquered and squeezed Miss Atlantico, the Department received the 14th title of the first miss. Melina has thus joined the representatives of women from Valle del Cauca, who have reached the victory coronation, but have finally been announced by the first multimisss. Between them belongs Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena ALVArez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanke (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garces Alure (2000), Catalina Giraldos (Gyraldoc) (2007), Aphanie (2007).
The question that many people ask.
The result is the defeat of a great favorite who in all the previous circles showed that she had to become a new Miss Colombia, not for free became the Queen's police and the Best Face of Joile de Volgue. These titles, for example, have been reached by Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, which followed the title of Miss Columbia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to appoint it only the First Multimiss is that she did not convince her answer to the question, "Which book liked you most and why?", put by Martin Murillo Gomez from the literary edition of Leamos.
The candidate answered:
"I read a lot. I believe very much in the role of literature, I think it's one of the forms of culture. The book that affected me most in my childhood was "Little Prince", a very deep book.
It is a book that is part of the universal literature that we should all know, and today I have a book from Irene Nemirovski, Russian authors. It is a beautiful book called "El Ardor de la sangre".
However, the answer did not like because of the term "culturalization" and secondly because the candidate did not explain what individual books mentioned to her.
After the end of the ceremony, Melina declared that she is calm and is happy with the result: "The world is wise what is to happen will happen.
And you people read, if you can, the little prince is a beautiful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed her favorite position.
The Godotic journalist indicated that the fact that the candidate was the most favorite, the most famous and the one that took away all the previous prices (Gastronomic challenge of Oster, public title for the best art dress and the Queen's mother), raised the jealousy of other applicants, stressed the queen, which then struck up on the scene.
It was evident at the first presentation of swimming at the beach of Hilton and during two shows before the final crown.
Even though it shineed on both, it was known that she lacked strength and inflammation that the representatives of Magdalen and Atlantico showed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the Canal RCN program, believes that Melinda has won the title of the first multimiss confirms the fact that a candidate who gets most titles at the contest finally does not go with the Queen's crown.
Furthermore, the Valle had a rather indecent view of the media in recent days, and it was not worth it.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of its interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
Only on the edge, two days before the international member of the jury, Lucy Doughty, said they were looking for a woman who will know the social needs of her country.
"In Miss Columbia's competition, beauty itself is not enough, it is necessary to see more than just physical beauty. It is important to focus on social feelings. It is important that candidates have been involved in such projects before they enter the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that the candidate Valle lost points because of the lack of her background and fibrosis, which was apparent on her ass. This is entirely contrary to the jury's verdict, which has chosen Miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, the right nutrition and the responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernan Orozco, who is preparing the queen, admits that Melina had no best body that there were better girls, "but the problem with the fibrosis on the ass, which, in my opinion, was not too famous, they took her points until the last day."
Meanwhile, a journalist Guido Hoyos in Cromos believes that the Valle family made a mistake when she made several surgery.
"The surgery's fine, but they didn't make it in Valla.
The body was never her strong page, and here she chose her tax."
Because of this appreciation that was first made by the National Beauty Meeting, after the swimming show, a cruel predictions had been fulfilled. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymund Melina had made so that he could not finally give her the highest crown.
Whether it is true or not, it is sure that Melina has launched a year of her rule today, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia at various international competitions, where it will be appointed by the National Competition itself.
Nevertheless, it will be entered into history as one of the queens who, despite the collapsing success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
This was the work of the inhabitant of Cali who identified the body of Alfonse Cana.
The Cali fingerprint expert went into history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfons Cana.
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4th, last year, a CTI fingerprint expert entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the highest leader Farc: "Alfonse Cana", by comparing fingerprints.
Of seven fingerprint experts working at the CTI department this week, the Eliazar Gonzalez, the man from Puert Tejad, who worked in the field of trial for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked at the Council in Choco, where he had to run through the forest for more than five days to get to the place where the bodies had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle's capital city and after graduating the relevant courses, he began specializing on fingerprints. This science is dealing with a study of skin shaving, which is the hand and legs.
In the week when an operation was performed against Alfonsa Cana, Eliazar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night, he went to Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he would have to identify two bodies and suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerille in the world, so he was asked to take a card with the fingerprints of Guillerm Leon Saenz (her real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigator team to the place where the corpse was located, he didn't recognize him because of his physical perspective.
He had no beards, he was dressed like a villager in a given area, without glasses, much slighter.
But the prints don't lie.
In addition to the galton lupe, the ink and the transplant and the light of Eliazar began comparing the dactyl records of the body with the card records.
The eye didn't disappoint him: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was authorized to confirm whether it was really the highest commander of Farc.
Search for tracks
For dactyloscope from Sien de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos showed to Eliazar Gonzales at the press conference of Operational Services against Canna is very important.
Many people don't know our job.
Dactyloscopy is exact science, without the possibility of a mistake that can play a key role in deciding crimes.
In addition to the identification of corpses, these people help research crimes such as stealing or murder and confirm the identity of captured persons.
When they get caught, a lot of criminals present false documents or they don't have any papers at all.
We take their fingerprints and we're looking for them in the database.
The investigator reported that in the case of injuries, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house in the house because the thief was on the ground to pull out the treasure full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended to collect fingerprints, but in this case we could get a fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the perpetrators who participated in several stealings," he recalled.
The fingerprints can also confirm or dismiss suspects in the case of murder.
Recently, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around them.
On the basis of the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and the bottle's fingerprint could really be confirmed.
Although it can't be confirmed 100% that he was a murderer, it's obvious that he appeared on the scene of crime.
The CTI fingerprint expert explained that the items are "cleaned using chemical or physical reactive substances".
When it appears, the transplant or tape is used for their collection.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is a database of deliquients, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians whose data are not transmitted anywhere," the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as it appears in the CSI TV program.
Just like everything that shines, there's no gold, not everything you touch remains a trail.
However, if it can be used, the corresponding comparison must be performed.
"Abusiveness" protests in New York
There were hundreds of manifestants in the Zuccotti Square where they wanted to be established.
Many of them waited for a cleaning order and moved to the nearby park.
The members of the Movement Object Wall Street provoked the representative of New York on Tuesday when they tried to get back to the Manhattan Square, where they were taken out in the morning, and then tried to pick up another New York park.
The hundreds of manifestants were pressed to the Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get through a court order, which allows the "angered" to come back to the place. The second part of the movement responded to cleaning by taking the park in the north of the city where there was another detention.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will sit in a different place and continue a legitimate battle to return to Zuccotta, both through the meetings and peaceful manifestations," said one of the speakers' movements "Let's beat Wall Street," Mark Bray.
Bray stated that the reply of the "reluctant" to the camp that the mayor of New York himself ordered, Michael Bloomberg, had reached the court where Judge Lucy Billings had issued an order that prohibited the violent displacement of the site and allowed the manifestants to continue here.
Furthermore, the "agitation" also took the other park located on the Central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the land of the farm in Trinity Church.
At least for an hour, they managed to take a place, but then the police came and detained some manifestants. Bray didn't know the exact number, but he said he saw the ties put on to some journalists.
The organization assures that several hundred people had accommodated at the site, and the delegation of religious representatives also came to express their support and to try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed. The trials are expected to be held on Tuesday and during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the displaced manifestants even distributed and distributed copies of a court order and even gave them to the members who were watching the square, which caused "some small conflicts," Bray, who condemned the fact that some police manifestants were beaten.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities to immigrate members of the Okupa Wall Street movement or to use "laws that have been published after the ceiling, or to prohibit access to the park with stores or other places they used before".
The mayor Bloomberg stated for the press that, in view of this court order, the city has suspended the reopening of the public space and the manifestants noted that local laws prevent them from returning states and spaces.
The highest representative of the city personally defended the morning dismissal of Zuccotti Square, the operation where 200 persons were detained and which were accessed because the manifestants "violently violated the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered to evacuate the square because it was "the place where people were not going to protest, but to violate laws and in some cases to hurt others," because "some trades received threatening letters" and "sousedes were worried about the quality of their life".
"The early cleaning was awkward and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests on the penalty of the American working people," he added the speaker's movement that accused the mayor that "he doesn't respect freedom of expression."
The representatives of the Okupa Wall Street also stated that they plan to organize "great actions" on Thursday in collaboration with communities and committees to remind two months after which the protests lasted, because they started on September 17th.
Pamela Anderson will represent Miss Maria in a special Christmas TV show.
Together with Michael Bublé and other important Canadians, the TV program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" will appear on 1 December.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant at "Home Improvement", a swimmer in "Baywatch", a rabbit in "Playboy", the wife of the year's musician Tommy Lee and now the model will be Miss Maria in a special Christmas show of Canadian TV.
The private TV TV station announced today that Anderson and the Sentimental Song Michael Bublé and other important Canadians would appear in the "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st and will enthusiasm the Miss Maria.
The CCTV today showed videos from the TV program, in which Anderson, also known from the Internet home pornography, appears with her ex-husband, the "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Leem, as the Miss Maria, holding a doll in the slippers representing Jesus.
Like Joseph, Peters, a famous Canadian Comic of Indian origin, who recently acted as a moderator on the tournament "My Violente Torpedo of True" Charlie Sheen.
Crome Anderson and Peters will appear in the special Christmas TV singing of the Canadian Bublé, who married in Buenos Aires at the end of March with the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, who is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian at one of her concerts in New York "Liss".
Japan returns to life after a devastating earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% due to household consumption and thus ends the period of falls that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, now recovered from a destructive earthquake that has risen into the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country had to face since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government calculated material losses to $300,000 million, the wound that despite the difficult world situation is well healed.
After three quarters of fall, the GDP value between July and September has reached such a position that it was possible to turn the page with definitive validity: GDP increased by 1,5% compared to previous quarter and by 6% per year.
The results of the second quarter - for Japanese, the tax year begins in March 2012 - also assumes the largest rate of growth compared to January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partially explained by the purchase of machines necessary to renew the areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunami.
Investments have increased by 1.1%, expenditures fall by 0.9% compared to January to March. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy comes exclusively from the impulse that forces the crisis to exploit or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan awakes, especially because of the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of the Japanese GDP.
This variable has increased by 1% by increasing the cost of vehicles, roads and free-time activities.
Stigma yen
The flows have been conferred to the internal market when yen - Japanese currency - has become one of the "saved values" for investors who flee from the euro area's debt crisis and from the alarming prognosis of the United States. It is a privilege that is also a major burden for export companies.
With a stronger currency, products in abroad are more expensive, which is negative for the country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony have been composing their weak results in July until September just the yen course.
While the markets continue to be surrounded by the EU border countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government is careful.
"We must look at risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of the flood in Thailand and the rapid increase of yen," stated yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohis Furukawa.
Indeed, the perspectives are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most of the Member States reported clear signs of economic slowness in September.
The indicator that predicts improperity in the world's economy has shown that the economy of the main powers is slowing down.
It fell by four tens to 100.4 points in August.
The Eurozone has even reached under the average of 100 levels. It has reached up to 99.13 points.
Athens are spreading uncertainty again
Papadimos says that savings will be approved, but the conservatives will not sign any written obligation
With rapid and risky boundary guarantees and uncertainty that has reconsidered, Greece is increasingly involved in the labyrinth, leading to a major debt crisis in Europe.
The presumption that the "show" of the new transitional Greek government is given to Brussels rather than the true belief of political forces is being confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lucas Papadimos, yesterday admitted that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of 100 days received at his appointment will probably be short for their application, the President of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, declared that the new savings measures will no longer be supported and repeated his requirement to put new elections on the expected date on February 19th.
"The main task of this government is to apply the Summit Decision of 26 October," Papadimos declared yesterday during the parliamentary debate, which will summit tomorrow by voting on the government's trust.
A package with 24 programmes to support employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax escape will be among the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, the message of Samaras does not clarify any doubts about his attitude: "We have committed to helping the transitional government, but we have no longer committed to anything else."
The Chairman of Conservatives went a little far to the EU and the MMF address in his speech, and these organizations have to unlock 8 billion that Athens urgently need. At the same time, he declared that they would not support and sign any commitment on the implementation of savings measures.
The European Commission, already irritated by the impact caused by Papandre's referendum, emphasized yesterday that its requirements are invincible: it does not block any assistance unless the new government and the representatives of the main parties sign "written obligation without binary and perhaps as soon as possible".
Speaker for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafai, explained that the inspectors from Troy will return "very soon" to Athens and will deal with the new government on "what it needs to pay the sixth part" 8 billion. The definitive date is not.
The Greek patches have a little more time from what's going on.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The queen raises Spain's privileged position in relation to this type of finance
Spain has "done a significant position at the global level as regards microfinance".
The queen Sofia recalled yesterday that in the last two decades the country became the second donor of the planet, with regard to this tool of cooperation, whose fundamental is that it is a tool for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It is a tool based on human trust.
The Queen launched yesterday the 5th World Summit of Micro Loans in Valladolide with the belief that "no doubt" is that this type of operation "is ultimately necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations until 2015. "Especially, the objectives are to achieve a reduction of half the number of people living with less than one dollar per day, that is the amount set by the poverty threshold."
Spain "will continue to work" and extend the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and takes this task accountable", emphasized Queen Sofia, who hopes that initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which will take place until Thursday, "to ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", which are primarily designed.
"We have already achieved a lot," and "a lot of challenges are still ahead of us."
The summit on micro-borrowers should be not only a discussion forum but also a platform that supports "base targets".
Her Majesty explained that the goal is by the end of 2015 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services and to get 100 million families above the poverty threshold under which they live.
The concept of the micro-borrowers to Spain and to other countries of the world expanded after "which the pioneer of the thought of Muhammad Yunus has come to this trip," the Queen said and added that it is "act of justice and the necessary recognition".
The father described this instrument as a "amazing idealist who went to the way of fighting poverty." She met his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladež to meet her place directly with his loans policy.
Following this experience, the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as the Coast of elephant in 1999, Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I could establish continuous development, the Queen explained that by its support of this project, she earned the title "the head of the family" in Valladolid yesterday.
The Queen Sofia finished her performance by calling participants to participate in the discussions and search for solutions and thus allowing them to continue to fight poverty.
"Ethic imperative"
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, declared that solidarity "is an ethical imperative", which must be managed by all democratic States.
In this sense, she said it would be a mistake connecting cooperation with developing countries only with the period of ballooding, because this cooperation is "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believes that the micro-borrows represent "serious and fair policies to eliminate poverty", and now more than ever before, the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the solidarity criteria and do not allow solidarity to become victims of scratches.
For Spain, the micro loan is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The National Secret for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, welcomed the success that celebrated the concept based on giving confidence to people whom everyone else closes the door. Mayor Valladolidu, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed the participants in the city who "opens his gates to the spirit of solidarity that is infectious".
CDU suggests that the European President be voted on the basis of general election law
Without serious difficulties for the Chancellor and Chairman, the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel took place on Monday, on 14 November, in Libya, the first day of the Christian Democratic Union Congress (CDU).
The question of the future of Europe was not originally, but it took place on the autumn, especially to meet the members of the party who consider government policy today against the Greeks and perhaps tomorrow against the Italians as lax.
The proposal on the President of the European Commission was adopted by the leadership of almost unanimously.
Only nine of the numbers of 1001 delegates were against, and 10 delegates had delayed the vote.
A few-mileon fruits are concluded by Angela Merkel's presentation and followed a few hours later, Wolfganga Schäubla, a very pro-European finance minister, did not leave a place for doubts.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summarized into the slogan: the response to the crisis "not less than Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs are dependent directly on euro".
According to the chancellor in Europe, "The time of change has come."
This could be expressed by changes in the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the European Union's control of the euro area budget policies, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of the universal election law "to give Europe one face".
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by the Congress, whose inspirer is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all the twenty-seven countries agree quickly on this revolutionary step: against the opposition of Great Britain and the leaders of the CDU think the same position is taken by Nicolas Sarkoza.
But the direction is exhausted.
Similarly, the delegations rejected a large majority of the proposal to assess the weight of each country in the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which would obviously result in strengthening Germany's weight.
She was concerned to calm the climate within her side, the Chancellor made several links to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. She did not try to gain a congress by talking about "small" European states or countries in troubles willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
For a proposal on Europe, one paragraph of the importance of "Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago, there was a bloody battle in Lipska.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleon Army.
What is a fraud in the worklessness?
After support, the UMP parties and the government shall launch an offence against worklessness.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be visited in Bordeaux on Tuesday, on 15 December, and will visit the Social Assistance Authority, where it will speak on the topics repeated since 2007 on the fight against social fraud and the distribution of solidarity.
As an accompanied by this offensive, which is due to the will of carrying out savings in the context of increased strictness, but is not less clear from the right presidential campaign, the right majority wants to focus on working inability.
First, due to the budget savings, the government intends to force employees of the private sector on the fourth day of worklessness before they start taking support in the disease.
Clearly, without the company's consent, the employee who is sick would lose four days of remuneration, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
Measures risking many evil blood but which, according to Les Echos, 280 million euros could bring.
As well as measures to be accompanied by further measures of symbolic achievement: to give public employees one day unsaved worklessness (do not have any incompetentness in relation to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are subject to discussion, the right majority also launches the theme of fraud that is aimed at criminals associated with working incompetentities this time.
"Controls will be much larger and more: if you are arrived, you will return," Xavier Bertrand noted at the interview of the RTL station on Sunday, on November 13th.
Like in other cases, the effects of the notifications appear to be slightly unreasonable with regard to the truth of illicitities in the worklessness.
These were actually the subject of continuous monitoring since 2002 and the political effort that produced their fruit.
The French are not more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to Caisse nationale d'assurance of maladia (CNAM - state health insurance) more than 237 million euros of daily refunds were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Health Documentation, the daily refunds, with their 11.3 billion euros, represented 5% of health expenditure in 2008.
Of this amount, 46% were related to maternal contributions and work injuries and 54% were related to job failures, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
I mean, only 2,5% of health costs.
According to an Alma Consulting Group, the French had average 14,5 days of worklessness compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
Average which covers certain derogations: another survey published in 2007 on Monster.com work opportunities pages showed that 75% of the 40,000 questions of French employees responded that they did not choose any working day of inability.
Another study, this time conducted by hospital insurance institutions, states that in 2010 37.8% of working failures were shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% lasted longer.
When we compare them to their European neighbours, French employees are not more than inclined to work incompetent.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001, total absence (for health reasons or not) was decisive in France between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in Great Britain and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in working failures represents only a very small part of black work.
As for fraud, these are just a small range.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic controls aimed at job failures for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM concluded that at 1.5 million checks 13.8% of 285,000 carried out due to short-term failures "not authorised or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incompatibilities longer than 45 days, 11% of cases of "unauthorized or unauthorized" were calculated to 1,2 million checks, i.e. 132 000.
Therefore, a total of 169,000 "unlawed" cases for several million employees who have been incapable of work.
A number that represents much less than a number of black work.
According to UMP Dominiquea Tiana, author of the June report on this issue, this number would represent 9 to 15 billion euros missing in the selection of taxes per year, i.e. more than the total daily refunds and thus infinitely more than the frauds associated with the last mentioned.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new salvation plan
Greece will need a new rescue programme to restore its economy.
On Monday, on 14 December, the parliamentary President Lucas Papademos said that 100 days of unity to his government would not be sufficient to fulfil this task.
"To re-establish our economy, we need support of our European partners and a new rescue budgetary plan," the chief of the government said when he was exposing his first public speech in the middle at the beginning of a debate to vote for confidence in Parliament.
The application of the decisions adopted on 27 October at the summit of the euro area will be "the main task" of the new government, since the participation of our country in the euro area, he added.
As a result, Mr. Papademos assumed that the public deficit of the country would be from now on to the end of the year "in the surrounding 9%" of the gross domestic product since it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new savings measures
The Leader of the Right Antonis Samaras expressed its support on Monday by already approved measures to try to escape the debt crisis, but noted that his party was not obliged to any additional savings measures.
"We will not raise a hand for no new measures," Samaras emphasized the meeting with the Members on his side of New Democracy.
We agreed on the objectives of reducing deficit and debt and fighting waste, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr. Ollim Rehn, the European Economic and Monetary Commissioner, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not block the necessary loan of 8 billion euros without a written guarantee of all parties to support the proposed measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and would not sign anything under external pressure.
Eutanasia and associated suicide must be legalized, the Commission of Experts said
According to the Royal Canadian Company, the Canadians have been denied death.
In the matter of palyative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palyative care, even in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of the Canadians really accept the possibility to talk to the doctor about the conditions they want to die and make decisions in this sense.
This is one of the extensive conclusions of the Royal Canadian Company, which included six experts working in various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Commission recommends that the government change the criminal law so that it allows the associated suicide and eutanasia, if this option is necessary for a patient considered to be competent to take such decisions.
In the beginning, experts quote the recent survey of independent Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Perhaps Canada is situated in the 10th place, the study notes that "medication of death in Canada has led to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death."
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of the Canadians have no access to palyatic care, we are informed by experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite the desire to die at home that most of the Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average applies to all Canada, while the Québec province is the highest number of 86% of the dead in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of eutanasia and associated suicide, the authors of the report conclude that they go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that the criminal law relating to eutanasia and the associated suicide does not want to change anything.
According to experts who have also understood the control of all countries where these approaches are legalised or not considered to be a criminal case, there is no evidence that this deterioration causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in practice of eutanasia or associated suicide to persons inadmissible or disagreeable.
On the contrary, Mr Jocelyn Downie, a co-autor of the report, confirmed more than a number of cases of these excess in the countries where eutanasia and associated suicide are not legalized yesterday at the teleconference.
"Eutanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is performed in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are inclined to eutanasia
Recall that, according to an examination carried out by Angus Reid in 2010, 85% of the Canadians have already spoken for eutanasia because they believe that they will allow people to relieve their suffering at the end of their life.
And 66% believe that legalization of eutanasia will not mean that we're sending the message that the life of old or disabled persons is less valuable.
With regard to persons who practice an associated suicide, 41% of the questionnaired persons believe that they should not be prosecuted in court.
In the case of maintaining or interrupting patient care, the situation is less clear, say reporters.
The list of their recommendations also suggests that criminal law indicates that derogation from the treatment for which there is legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The Commission of Experts also requires that professional doctors be educated to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of their life without being afraid of a criminal persecution.
In the matter of palyative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palyative care, even in cases of cancer.
Finally, in the matter of palyative or final silence already used in Canadian health facilities, the Commission requires that it be considered at the time when it is no longer used to reduce the physical pain, the eutanasia and to be subject to the same procedures.
Exceptions of other experts
Some medical experts have already commented on the conclusions of the report of the King's Canadian Company.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, medical specialist, qualified the position of the reporting experts as "extreme" among other things because he does not limit the practice of eutanasia to the sick at the final stage.
"This opens the door to the situation where anyone who was tired of life and who was more than 18 years old could ask to help him commit suicide," said Pierre Deschamps, who studied the summary news yesterday.
P. Deschamps also underscores that it looks like the authors of the report are building a person's autonomy over all the other values that form the social prevalence of society.
Because in society, he says, there are warning marks and limitations."
The medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "potential objections to the conclusions of the report qualified as "the eutanasist".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Canadian Company, doubts particularly the data of the report on the absence of doubt in some countries where eutanasia and associated suicide are legalised, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the US state of Oregon.
The king of Jordan invites President Assad to resign
Damask is talking about "completion"
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Basar al-Assad's representatives showed up yesterday before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syria, President Basar al-Assad, who resisted Russia and spoke of "completion" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership in the Lisa of Arab States, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, have taken an opinion for President Assad's departure.
Jordanian King Abdallah II was yesterday the first ruler of the Arab state, who called President Basar al-Assado to see in Syria where about 40 civilians and members of the regime were killed," he passed power.
"If Basar had the interests of his country on the heart, he would have to demiss, but he would also have to create conditions necessary for the new stage of Syrian political life," said King Jordan, the neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview for the BBC station.
On its side, Turkish diplomacy chief Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the efforts devoted to Turkish mediation in the Syrian business regime since the beginning of the year were not crowned by success.
"Those who in the Middle East do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them, will leave," he declared with an instant on the neighbouring Syria, with Turkey's increasingly stronger line.
The United States rejoiced with "increasing consensus against Assad and the unfair negotiation of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, the countries like Turkey apply increasingly stronger tone" in Syria's repression, noted Mark Toner, speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced, during that time, 16 civilians and 19 members of the intergovernmental forces died in Deraa in the south of Syria.
According to this non-governmental organization, two other civilians were killed" in the shootings and focused shooting from heavy bullets in the city of Jobar" in the Homs area.
However, during the press conference, the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid Moullem estimated that the country was "to the way out of the crisis".
Otherwise, he responded lively to the decision of the League of Arab States to stop Damascus of membership, which, according to him, constitutes a dangerous step.
Syria's 'not going to go away', he added, with certainty that's not going to succeed in the "competences against Syria".
After its decision to stop Syria, membership is being considered in the present League of Arab States 'mechanism of Protection of Civil Persons' and plans to send 500 human rights protectors, journalists and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe is also favourable to the idea of sending UN observers in order to help protect civilians from repress of a regime that he considers "paranoid".
The new special meeting of the League is called for tomorrow to Rabat to take an opinion on the plan for the resolution of the crisis decided on 2 December and in which the army was particularly expected to be withdrawn from the cities of detention and the release of prisoners.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov considered yesterday the decision of the Liga of Arab States "fake", while China urged Syria to accept the crisis's plan, while it was totally avoiding the support of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and victims by Italy
The next chief of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for a little time to form his team and start applying the program that will contain "familiar" to regain confidence lost in the last months of the Berlinisconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with political parties yesterday before meeting the representatives of experts and employers today.
It should be composed of a relatively thin cabinet consisting of technocrats not belonging to the parliamentary parties.
"Monti talked about the important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a Member of a number of parliamentary groups participating in the interviews, after meeting with the designed ministerial president.
The Chairperson of the Chairman of the Parliament's House of Justice, Gianfranco Fini, expects Mario Monti to ask Parliament to express confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation ends by introducing a small team of 12 ministers to President Georgio Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented on the nerve last night on the financial markets and asked for time.
In "democracy, the exact terms apply" as regards the preparation of the government and its programme, he emphasized and added that it is "true that the markets will be patient and understanding".
His appointment by the president was first accepted favourably, but the anxiety again appeared after the unexpected failing of industrial production in the euro area.
The appointed Minister-President should draw up a Technology Technology Technology team, even though he emphasized that he would also like to adopt "politicians".
He expressed his conviction that the new government will last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next elections.
According to the President of the Parliament's Parliament's House, the new government will be trusted by Parliament by Friday.
Mario Monti promised after his function to deal with urgent urgency and to make Italy a strong member of Europe.
The speaker of European Commissioner Olli Rehn emphasized that "and our new government diagnosis of Italian economy does not change."
The European Union is convinced that, despite the savings plans adopted in the past months, the Rome will not achieve its goal to balance its budget in 2013 and require new hard measures.
The Chief of the Entrepreneurial Union, Emma Marcegagli, who meets Montim on Tuesday, focused on the need to renew the economy 'or the country that does not show growth cannot obey deficit parameters.'
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004), recognised for his expertise and independence, "professor" symbolizing according to the authors of the "invitation to seriousness" and "Other Italy", represents an "epochal change" for Italy after 17 years "berlusconism".
His team's lifetime will be a great stranger.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy has to place national debts for 200 billion euros by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helped Iranian nuclear programme
Soviet scientist Vjačeslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator used for atomic weapons, announced on Tuesday an American NGO specialized for atomic risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) and other documents escaped from this UN agency.
Last week, the MAAE announced its "value concern" as regards the "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the ISIS Institute widely drawn from the MAAE documents, V. Danilenko (N. 1934) should work for three decades since the 1960s in the Soviet Military Research Centre in Čeljabinsk (Ural), where it should be dealt with the production of synthetic diamonds by the explosion method.
In 1989 or 1991, he was to leave the centre to establish a "nano-diamonds" in Kijev.
His economic difficulties were to lead him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before he returned to Russia, he was then to cooperate from 1996 to 2002 at the Iranian programme.
In its last report, MAAE recalls "jaspit data that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" was based on the work of a foreign specialist who did not only know this method well, but who, as one Member State informed the agency, worked during a substantial part of its career on this technology within the country's military nuclear programme from where it comes."
Antimuslim criminal acts and delicts have increased by 50%
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of criminal acts and delicates targeted against Muslims increased almost by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence were mildly declined or slightly increased.
According to these numbers, the total number of violence committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% of the increase in the process against the Catholics, decreased by 4% in the offences against the Jews and total increase by 14% in anti-religious criminal acts and delicates.
The total number of "hatred criminal acts" has risen very easily to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% have been motivated by the FBI by racial differences and 20% of religious differences.
"After the loss in 2009, it is disturbing to see these criminal acts and delicacies rise again," the organization of Human Rights first emphasized the growth of anti-muslim violence is particularly important," the organization added in its communication.
"Human Rights First has emphasized for a long time that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hated criminal acts, must be considered serious violations of human rights," Paul Legendre adds.
"American government can and must do more to deal with these criminals," he adds and estimates that this could take place by improving police reports of "hatred criminal acts".
The "hatred criminal act" in the US federal law is the inheritance of the fighting time for civil rights.
This law was adopted after Martin Luther King died to punish violence related to race, colour of skin, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter service provider introduced a change in design on Monday to enable its users to observe the activities of followers, which somehow illustrates its Facebook services.
New offers "activity" and "name" allow better and directly to know the activities of other people who are watching you or those whose answers ("tweets") are you.
This allows you to know whether they are allowed to monitor contributions, whether they are logged in to new accounts, whether they have favorite contributions, etc.
This new Twitter face was tested "in August on a small percentage of users" before it was extended to the whole network on Monday, told the AFP speaker Twitter Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, who was known for his little instinctive function, with the terms of somewhat disagreeable (RT for repeated spread of the contribution of someone else, next Friday pour recommender de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi and un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable and celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users immediately in their "tweets" differently assess the importance of this innovation.
"It's useless, it takes a lot of space and it's too much like Facebook," says @jamb123.
"The Activity function will help me better monitor some of my Twitter elements," he sent @dannycronstrom.
Austria
Writing a golden rule on a balanced budget into the Constitution
The Government of the Great Coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, who are in Austria, decided on Tuesday to write "the golden rule" of budget policy into the Constitution to reduce public deficits and avoid the possible reduction of Austria's rating agencies (AAA).
It was the very social-democratic Officer Werner Faymann, who announced this decision at the conclusion of the ministerial consultations in a situation where the Austrian public debt is 74.6% high above the criteria maximum of 60% of the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solutionability was reduced by only one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay the interests each year by three billion euros more," a multianchor and foreign minister, Christian Democrat Michael Spindelegger, argumented.
Austria thus refers to the summit of the euro area held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the chiefs of States and governments urged by the end of 2012 to reduce the public deficit and to achieve the balance of public accounts to the constitution or to the same value law.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government approaches the German model, Germany was the first European country that adopted such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, starting in 2017, the public structural deficit of the Federal State will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the common countries and the community will have to report a balanced budget.
The goal is to obtain a public debt under the criteria 60% of the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong only
Noda threatens a new intervention in the exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to reinfluered on the exchange markets if he had only to continue to strengthen.
"We'll hit as we did last, if we find out too much instability" in the exchange course, he explained the Y. Noda Senate.
On Tuesday, he only reinstateed to historic values that the Japanese authorities forced to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokio was selling eins for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which only recently overcome the record against the dollar valid since 1945.
But only since then, it has been a regular rise in support of the purchase of investors who consider it "safe port" in the uncertain periods of the global economic slowdown and the European crisis caused by debt.
The dollar again arrived under 77 yens on Tuesday and the euro dropped under the symbolic plate of 105 yens near the level that led to the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was worth about 120 yen and EUR over 160.
This Japanese currency exploits island exports because it explodes the price of Made in Japan and reduces the value of the profits obtained by Japan's foreign companies when they are transferred to domestic currency.
"Japanese is recovering" from the destruction caused by the march earthquake and the wave of tsunami demolished by the region of Tohoku in the northeast of the country, stressed Y. Noda, who fears that this irritation would not be killed in the egg of slight recovery.
The third economic power of the world renewed growth in the third quarter (1.5% in view of the previous quarter) for the first time in one year, through an examination of export growth and household consumption.
But the minister's president considered that the high value of a single was not reflected by the "national economy of Japan".
The Japanese Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, called on the Japanese Central Bank (BoJ), which launched its political and monetary council on Tuesday on a two-day meeting to take all possible measures leading to the weakness of the jean.
But the multiguverner of this institution, Hirohide Yamaguci, noted that BoJ has already adopted "proper measures" suggesting that no additional currency weaknesses can be expected in the middle.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the securities institution increased by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) its purchases of state cash leaflets and increased to 55.000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling of the amounts devoted to the purchase of various securities to flood with liquidity.
Eurozone:
The rates rise, the storms fail
The risk of debt crisis is still undermining European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new government chiefs in Greece and Italy and the better numbers of growth in France and Germany, the rates of weak countries continue to grow.
The European Bureau remains concerned about the stability of the euro area today, on Tuesday 15 November, falls into negative expectations.
In Paris at 10 hours, CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
"With new tensions around euro area lending loans, the markets of shares throughout the world are only part of the recent profits."
"Nervous investors only realize the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, an IG Markets trader quoted by the Reuters Agency.
The market in Tokyo was closed by 0.7% suffering from the concerns of participants on the ability of Europe to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and the shift will continue only in the narrow variation corridor until the investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized," Mitsushige Akino, manager of funds at Ichiyoša Investment Management.
This restart of uncertainty on the future of the euro area damages the currency itself that continues to decline on Tuesday.
The Euro is delivered at the lowest level from a month and a half ago.
At 10 a.m., the European currency is valued by $1.3570 at a departure by 0.4%.
According to the monetary traders, the CDU party of the Chancellor Angela Merkel adopted a proposal on Monday, assuming an opportunity to step out of the euro area for countries that are in trouble without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond the border 6%
The interest rates in loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very disturbing amount.
This morning, on Tuesday, the return of Italian ten-year bonds reaches 6.85% and the salary of Spanish ten-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of the Southern European countries, but also in France, continue to strengthen the concerns of market participants.
The Chief of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, urgently demanded time on the markets to fix the situation in Italy threatened by the poisonous amount of its debt.
The new Greek minister, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that the application of the decisions adopted on 27 October at the summit of the euro area will be "the main task" of his government.
Spain is again located in the intentional market line when the country is held on Sunday's elections to the Parliamentary House.
Difference of rates ("spread") between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historic maximum.
In expectation of numbers of eurozones notifying growth
Statistical figures say that France has recorded growth by 0.4% mainly by household consumption, i.e. a bit better than expected growth by 0.3% in third quarter.
The French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies, however, revised the numbers down for the second quarter to decline by 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And, in fact, it's the fourth quarter that the economies are most disturbing.
During the same period, Germany registered growth by 0.5%.
The first estimates across the euro area are expected at 11:00, while the European Commission has just noted the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must win the dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be taken on the basis of short-term balances or under emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and electricity price have a direct impact on the purchase power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is natural that the election meeting is an opportunity to think about such deposits and the place that takes energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful when all economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
The French must build their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic development will now result in duplicate demand for electricity by 2050, if we do not want a significant part of the world population to eliminate important parts of life.
At the same time, it will be necessary to face the lack of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity, while it cannot be forgotten the necessary need to reduce gas emissions caused by glass effects to combat climate change, which is the subject that is currently leaving the environmental debate.
The accident in Fukushima does not affect any of these parameters.
That's why Germany remains in its own decision to reject nuclear energy.
However, this is not a case of Belgium, which is subject to its decision to find another source capable of replacing itself, nor Switzerland, which considers the right to build only the power plants of the last generation.
On the contrary, UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue to decide on their projects.
The United States decided after Fukushima to expand their park by a single unit by renewing the construction of one power plant discontinued after the crash of the 3-mile island.
If a German model based on renewable energy is sometimes presented as an example, reality resists it.
The choice of Berlin will be manifested by an irritation of the price of electricity, increased energy dependence on gas, especially imported from Russia, the rapid increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of electricity to natural gas and carbon.
All these unpleasant effects will be experienced within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves us to consider it.
The European champion in wind power plants, of which 30% of its electricity is also one of the biggest carbon and gas consumers due to wind irregularity, which causes CO2 emissions and Danish prices to be higher than 65%, or 50% of the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the continuity of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay the invoice for electricity 40% higher than the payment of French households.
While the globalised energy economy is a key factor in competitiveness and the guarantee of maintaining industry in the national territory, the French companies benefit from the latest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the nuclear energy share would cause a strong increase in the price of electricity that would make an illustrative beautiful declaration of re-industrialization of our country and the defence of buying power.
The price that the large majority of the French refuses to pay, as is essentially not against this energy, as the public opinion surveys show.
Recall that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build the sector with 125,000 direct jobs and with 41,000 ongoing jobs.
The strong exporting sector is drawing a large quantity of small and medium-sized enterprises creating jobs that cannot be transferred to abroad.
If France had decided to leave the core, she would sacrifice a few of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would lose the euros of 6 billion per year that the country receives for the export of nuclear equipment and services.
Which owner of the power plant would order a nuclear reactor designed to work for 60 years while the decline of its manufacturer would be planned?
In order to solve the energy equation, it is necessary to admit that there is no magic source for energy production, as there is no devil.
The development of a low-emission device of CO2 nuclear equipment and renewable energy equipment carried out by the French Industrial Group of AREVA tests the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, the absolute need to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a National Nuclear Safety Office, which is conducting non-promissive and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams whose professionality is recognised have the idea of blood security.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry recognized three serious crashes.
The only one in the Tri Mile Island was in normal operating conditions and remained without human victims and environmental implications.
In Montenegro, the drama caused the concepts of the reactor and unexcusable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, some forget that the crash was the result of two natural disasters in an unprecedented range that caused tens of thousands of people to die.
The nuclear industry will take lessons from this crash as he did in two of the previous.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between the French and German authorities dealing with nuclear security, operators and constructors is that the EPR reactor represents the concept that can resist such phenomenons.
While all interested parties who wish to build a nuclear power plant consider it, the suspension of its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to the AREVA Group and the EDF competitors and the release of the road to enable the leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best solution to energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and machinaces to control the debate so crucial for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is it burden or chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out for Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised from various corners - the consumption of police, courts and administrations of the detailed number policy, the compatibility of this policy with the status "the country of human rights", which France praises.
It was recently a administrative disturbance, which was the object of foreign students who became current when the Minister of Interior (see Liberation of May 23) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, walls and waitress."
But so far, it was only rarely discussed under the angle of the economy.
It is necessary to say that in this area there is quite a wide match between the left and the right.
On the right tone in 1976, Jacques Chirac declared that "900000 unemployed people should not be a problem in the country where 2 million immigrants are located" and on the left of Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France "can't accept all the poverty of the world."
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of invasion of hords of Polish installers in the French territory was shared on the right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are considered to be a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity that we give to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande is limited to the banality when he claims that joint development will allow us to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as burden and problem may apply in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As the economics Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.) among specialists there is a broad consensus on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, remuneration and employment in countries that immigrants accept.
Limitation of immigration reduces growth and damages employment.
The concerns of the impacts caused by migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and create pressure on reducing their remuneration.
But experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than substitutes for French employees by doing work in sectors with lack of employees.
Low qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which education is not sufficient to offer places.
Positive impact on wages
As the surgeon will have problems with work in a country where there are lack of anesthesiologists, this supplementation between the French and the migrants causes the arrivals of immigrants to have a positive impact on the remuneration and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri so calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% will result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
However, it does not take into account the fact that the diversity made by immigrants contributes to the creation of thoughts and economic growth (a high share of naturalised immigrants among American Nobel Prices holders; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded).
Migrants are also a net contribution to social systems in European countries average of 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organization, for example, estimates that an immigrant in Germany, at 30 years of age, will bring a net contribution (minimum expenditure) 150,000 euros for the whole life of its public budgets.
Nicolas Sarkozy spoke at the beginning of his mandate to wish to come for missing percentages of growth "s estimated teeth".
The mentioned teeth that served for immigrants to disturb were just the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, a European democracy remains to be considered
Democracy is rare and very fragile.
The European continent should remember it, though two thousand years ago, in Athens, he had experienced the tragedy of world wars, totality regimes, holocaust, gulagos, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some people could believe that to triumph democracy definitely over their enemies, it would be enough to make the election and make it as direct as possible.
However, it was known from Napoleon that it was easy to think.
The universal election law, perhaps the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient and can become an instrument of oppression, as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, office and control of power, education, education, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis we have in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is so and from the beginning of the political and democracy crisis.
The recognition of the error of the Greek referendum type yes-not will in this direction have the value of double discovery: the discovery of the need for a great return of political power, but also the discovery of an alarming feeling of his inability, its inappropriateness.
This ambition must be considered so that it can be overcome.
The truth is that the lead lines of democratic pollution have moved today, and many of the Republican warriors are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We can't get anything if we require a number of national referendas organized according to the requirements and disorganized.
Bianko exposed to the European absolute monarch or jumping with bound legs to an empty nationalist depth: what choice for citizens!
No, we don't want the gylotine knife, but the common, full, peaceful and continuous election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - nor elsewhere we would know where to stop the calculation - because the crisis is in Europe.
Because this is a whole Europe that is confronted with market dictate and rating agencies who suffer from their inability and lack of solidarity.
Because this is the whole Europe that is humiliated at the international stage.
We are disturbed in the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but this is the whole Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty and with each of its nations.
The management of the European Democratic Supremeness Project should be urgently restored.
Because only together the Europeans will be able to reduce the burdens of their debts, to get rid of the government of the markets and to prepare the future.
The exit of the crisis will assume decisions at European level which will not be able to be adopted without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to a disaster.
After we've long fought against this proposal of socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today is very demanding a European economic government.
Behave.
But thinking about this without stronger political and democratic integration, and living as such citizens, would be a new foolishness and a new blind street.
We must take the new stage of European construction.
For the Republic of France, it was necessary to "be" republicans.
The revolution in favour could not be enough.
This lesson continues.
We have to build Europe, which will be more economically integrated.
This will only be possible by building Europe more politically democratic and real European democratic sovereignty.
Let's become Europeans to build Europe.
"No contact" chip cards are spreading
The optimistic atmosphere opens on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris the world fair of chip cards.
The 2011 office of Eurosmart should end with an increase in global sales of cards with microprocessor (bank cards, SIM cards) by 11% on more than 6 billion units.
The most wear is a segment of uncontact technology that allows payments in a bunch of transport or accommodation of shoppings by just approximating the card to the reader.
This year 460 million chip cards should be sold around the world against 320 million previously sold!
Their share should still be increased in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total market with chip cards (6.925 million cards).
Following a long time in the APEC stream, Europe is gaining a field in uncontact payment.
Approximately 26 million banking cards Visa is already equipped with this function and 75.000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, they are starting to be modest: 400 000 cards Visa were issued.
But big business chains work in two.
So this year Carrefour issued 2.5 million cards of Pass MasterCard.
In order to set up a higher speed degree, banks should have their clients equipped with them from now on.
"Two large French companies have committed to distributing systematically in the future to their clients with no touch of banking cards," Gerard Nébuy, Director-General of Visa Europe France, announced.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But it's only the first stage to pay for the future: the mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required to carry out transactions today is only a small number of devices.
"They got late."
"But their real rise should happen next year."
"For 2012, we estimate their sales in the world of 80 to 120 million units," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
The Crédit Agricole Bank announced yesterday the launch of a test carried out in Caen, which will take place from December to June of the next year.
The iPhone devices of approximately 200 clients and collaborators will be equipped with a score that allows incontact payments.
The BPCE Bank has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also the Social General announced yesterday that she was preparing to make an offer allowing her clients to pay the mobile phone without touch.
Terrorism front touches from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris disturbs the links between Al-Kayah in Islamic Maghreb and the Sect Boko Haram.
Long-term suspicion that there are links by the Al-Kaida terrorist group in Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian Sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria has "confided".
"The way both organisations operate, and the intelligence reports show that there is great co-operation among them," he explained without further accuracy.
It seems Paris has similar analysis.
The investigation of the kidnapping of two French in Niger in January 2010 could help light the connective bridges.
After members of AQMI were kidnapped from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers in the operation carried out by special French units.
The French and Nigerian investigators were going to find several phones with terrorist chips.
Terrorism axis
The analysis of the calls leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to the Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigator is particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to the Nigerian, who has long stayed in Maiduguri, the city in northern Nigeria, which is a colleague of Boko Haram, and the other to the man who is said to be close to AQMI and the sect.
"It is progress, but it must be waited for more convincing evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We've known for years that the sects have been looking forward to external financial and intellectual support and that they are increasingly active," a mild nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo said.
In the past months, this "support" has been more and more obvious in the development and expressions of Boko Haram or in its operating procedures, which are from now on involving human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same way of implementation as the device used by the AQMI.
The international community leading Washington since then has developed pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long viewed the group as a communities of enlightened mystics few good interests.
Quick Success
The Sect Boko Haram was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the muscle, school and fundamentalists of Mohammeda Yusufa. Boko Haram, which in the hauss language means "the Western education is sin", approves the establishment of the Islamic Emirate in Muslim North of Nigeria.
This poor region has such a rapid success.
The sect is politicized and requires strict compliance with Islamic law a share, while its representatives start fighting the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, the Boko Haram advocates become extremely active and multiply their attacks against police stations.
The reaction of the government is usually the same.
The army surrounds the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the sect Mohammed Yusuf was caught and killed in prison.
Since that time, the group is radicalized and left its accommodation in the north.
On Christmas 2010, an assassination in Jos, where 80 people die, will be followed by another in the capital of Abuja.
In June it's again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police's command at its first suicide attack.
And in August, the UN's local office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axle in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now disturbing all security specialists.
Now, when Al-Kaida islamic Maghreb was surrounded by Mali and Games and Al-Sabab's Somalians from the movement in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, at the interview with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppe said that France is in emergency and is ready to "provide all information".
The world according to the candidates for the President
In matters relating to China, Iran, or helping Israel with Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry, they are in the way of simplification and ignorance.
Can America weakened by the crisis manage the world through simple or even simplifying thoughts?
When the presidential candidates are listened, the voters might think so.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and others have repeated noise statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which is already traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
Frequently unfounded slogs about China, Iran or assistance to Israel are linked.
Mitt Romney, the best settled candidate in the nomination of the Republican "Grand Old Party", threatened by calling the Chinese before the World Trade Organization and their charges "for manipulation with their currency", which is the notorious theme in America of the migration of the entire industry towards Asia.
The worse, if this has to contain the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, the former Ambassador of Obam in China and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost dried in a position that "corporates" emotions.
He required a hard but constructive dialogue with Peking (contemporary position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who's in the last seats in the electoral estimates, remains unsustainable.
To the picture of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if they failed to sustain the sanctions when he stopped his nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll be trapped in Iran," said fanfaronic.
"If Obama will be elected again, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to increase Israel’s military assistance, accusing Obama of disappointment in his obligations against this partner.
Herman Cain, the second one of the most placed candidates, is showing the disgusting ignorance of the documents.
He recently called for a sharp position against the Chinese military threat because Peking's trying to develop nuclear capacities" - apparently unknown the fact that China has a nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to hit Iran, says he's ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against terrorists forbidden by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Caine, Perry and another candidate Michel Bachmann.
Everyone is far away from the Republican candidate John McCain in 2008, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The current president's opponents say Reagan had simple thoughts, and yet he won a cold war.
They remind Obama himself was a amateur and he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They emphasize the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the nasty departure of "boys" from Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya, and thus give him a flag of weakness.
But the attack is not easy.
The citizenship is assessing the national security policy of President Obama, who removed Ben Ladin, rather positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military intrusions that lead to the embarrassment.
And with arguments that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically in order to restore its leadership, Obama knocks to the right place.
North Stream, new port of Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream remote gaswater connecting directly Eastern Europe to Russia and led by the bottom of the Baltic Sea started working.
It must add gas equal to 30 million households.
Gazprom, Russian gas huge, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of states and government, participated in the inauguration of Nord Stream last Tuesday, a new gas pipeline that is directly connected to Russia and Germany under the sea.
The Symbolic German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Minister François Fillon and his Netherlands colleague Mark Rutte turned together controlling the russian gas entrance to the Western European network.
This new gas water will start flowing each year to Western Europe 27.5 billion additional cubic metres of Russian gas to the first pipeline of 1,224 km connecting Petrohrad region with the common country of Maclemburg-Pomoran.
The second pipes to be completed at the end of 2012 will allow for a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, which is a quantity equal to the entire French consumption.
And it's already reminded of the possibility of building a third gas pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, this huge building has the nature of winning.
Poland and the Baltic countries were strongly protested against the project.
Nord Stream will actually allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany without being led by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries lose some power: the possibility to push Russia by threats to close access to the Western European markets becomes more difficult for them.
It was most strongly expressed by Warsaw when she did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the new German-Soviet Covenant", appealing to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means to say that it's politically sensitive.
The Western Europe has supported this Russian project with greater confidence in its purchases.
But it is at the cost of weakening the energy of Europe, because the project created fractures between the eastern and west Europeans.
Russia had barely been able to make its vision of direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries with high gas consumption, whose beds are approaching its end.
"This gaswater is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new arterial that organicly connects us," François Fillon confirmed at the festival opening of this gas pipeline and demonstrated the great gas contracts of both political and economic matters.
This all explains the wide smiles of the leaders of Gazprom present in a large number in Lubmino, the gas water site.
The construction of this gaswater is also an important technical act.
The submarine pipes are made of steel with a concrete coat to protect them from the corridors of the sea vessels.
It is on the bottom of the sea in the average 200 m depth.
It was necessary to avoid mine fields originating in World War II.
"For security, almost a hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed," said Jens Müller, speaker of Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase the protection of fauna and flora.
The same pipe is a long metal snake weighing like 242 Eiffelovek, which is not interrupted at all its length either by ventiles or maintenance stations.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the leader of the project rejected it when the Swedish were only a little thirsty to see the Russian state company, as it was sitting on their coast.
"In the case of a disturbance, we stop the gas passage in less than one minute," Jens Müller states.
In the case of intimidation, the gas contained in the gaswater shall escape into the air.
But this case is considered to be unlikely to the builder, because the quarrel was designed to make the intimidation arise once for 100,000 years.
The control of the state of gaswater outside shall be carried out by a submarine robot pulled by the ship, while the gas inside is controlled by a device circulated inside.
This cigar shape apparatus with a diameter of 1 m is inserted into the inside of the pipes and is pushed by gas.
For the purpose of all three days of the 3 m/s route, it shall provide precise information on the possible deformations of metal parts.
The remote pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without needing a minor fix.
Gas circulation is simply secured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bars on launch and 100 bars in target.
Five companies combined the forces for the implementation of this project.
The leading position remains Gazprom, which holds 51%.
The German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Netherlands Gasunia and the French GDF Suez Group (9% each).
These five companies created a common company called Nord Stream, authorised by the construction and operation of gasproof.
The branch has a seat in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
The gazprom subsequently rented this company for five years of contract that can be renewed, all its capacity for gas transport.
"Gazprom will have profits from the total capacity, no matter how much really transported gas is," Jens Müller states.
The financing of the construction of gaswater was provided from 30% shareholders and 70% bank loans.
The total cost of work should reach 7.4 billion euros for both pipes.
For the GDF Suez group, investment costs were 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that their costs will be returned, since only Gazpro takes the risk.
The gas flows from the Baltic Sea in Lubmino on the sand coast with pine forests.
High 4.5 metres of ventiles form the gas gas gate exit gate.
The sensors measure pressure, temperature and other gas arrival characteristics before they are transported into German gaswaters.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been accepted every hour by a million cubic metres of Russian gas.
In achieving full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012 6 million.
Moleskine - tag notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, which was established 50 years ago, wishes to reiterate the joy of writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, the hours spent by writing at the light of the candles.
The notebook Moleskin is easily recognised with its black rectangular boards and its sheets send white colors as if they were old.
Because the record of Moleskin, as we know him today, was born in 1997.
The Italian Modo Modo settled in Milana will then decide to market a new design, but differentiated notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, is subject to the introduction of a new product.
The note is inspired by an old production technique "moleskin" (imitation of skin), which, for example, is used to adjust the surface of the benches.
This type of notebook was very valuable to writers and travelers.
"Moleskine returned to the favor of an old and forgotten object that was an icon of adventurous artists until the twentieth century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the leading person of the mark at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to settle on 12.7 million pieces last year.
The situation is a distant secret production from the first years when only 3,000 records were made.
Moleskin crosses the Italian borders and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It's difficult to build some artificial portrait of the buyer, because the notebook takes businessmen as well as students or professionals.
The image of the Moleskin notebook includes that its owners are people of space, cultivated and open spirit.
A small Italian company, who had 12 employees in its early days, has almost a hundred today, and since 2008 has two offices, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his records into bookstore and through a chain of FNAC trades to small botics in the centres of towns where he was able to propose his identity.
"We followed the spirit of time and this need for a new writing, through the violent development of e-mails," Maria Sebregondi explains.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently the mark opened the exhibition "Wandering", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, at the occasion of a film festival in Locarn, she also introduced new recording recorders reminiscent of leopard.
Moleskine profits from its success and this cultural aury and diversifys its products: bags, diaries, pencils, knives for laptops ... The mark is spreading across a number of carriers.
Success that raised envy: on autumn 2006 Modo was purchased by the SG Capital Europe investment funds, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine history.
Why is such a high share of unemployed disabled workers?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
Today it's opening 15 weeks for employment of disabilities.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed persons with disabilities is even twice above the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the entire population.
Is it creepy?
"No, underlines Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association of Adapt, which organizes a week for employment of disabled persons."
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable."
"There was not a percentage of unemployed twice, but three times higher."
"Nonetheless, there is much left to do."
It is necessary to say that unemployed disabilities keep numerous obstacles before they get to work.
It is an elderly person: 37% is over 50 years old (17% in the average).
They have low qualifications: 80% has no maturity and only 10,000 people are from 2.3 million high school students.
And finally - long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% in disabilities compared to 38% in the average.
These are simply criteria that complicate the return to employment and represent the "jader of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, the Director-General of Tremplin Association, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses take disabilities.
So much about objective brakes.
It remains unspeakable, ways of thinking that definitely develop, but too slow.
Study conducted in April by IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that the queried managers have a "slow level of knowledge of disabled persons" with "excessive idea of persons on a car chair and mental or mental deficiencies".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching targets to employ 6% of the disabled workers established in the 1987 Act.
The latest known numbers originating in 2008 are equal to 2.6%.
"We are now moving around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph's organization authorized by selecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
The number of "punished" companies, as well as the amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 guilty companies to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which has increased its contributions, has created strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates true awareness, especially in the great submissions."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of businesses with 20 to 49 employees employ disabilities compared to 82% of businesses with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "What luck"
Before Tuesday night (20h45), French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure of this friendly fight.
We're not going so far to write that there was a municipality among them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other on the Tribune of Stade de France, simply and well Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled.
Five months after his anger gesture in the fight against Turkey, the Belgian coach found only words of praise to his player.
"I am very satisfied with Eden and his progress, even with the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," the French Lille player assures.
With regard to the difference between his performance in the club matches and the fights of national men," it is the same, it is justified."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not a case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my mark."
The gambling, protected against Romania on Thursday night due to this fight against France, comes to the Station in Saint-Denis to finally "switch."
You can't mention the term "rejoice".
Play against Bleus, which he has encouraged since 7 years and in their victory in the years 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This must contribute even more to the "specific" character of this meeting.
More about that, because the opposite are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", recalls.
"We crossed at once."
"I can play against them, it's just a pleasure!"
Heartfully, Leekens also reminded "honor."
"Hudness" to fight "space - holiday."
"Hudness" also define in quality "souseds", that France has become a team of very high levels a little more than a year after a trauma in the South African town of Knysna" again.
"Laurent Blanc did a huge piece of work," he sighed.
As Belgium will be missing at the next European championship, a technical footballist would like to see the direction of Brazil in 2014 in the French plane.
"Our little Belgians will become great," he underscored.
"We're just building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will realize it for the next matches," including against France.
Portugal very self-conscious
The Portuguese Coach Paulo Bento launches a high optimism barage against Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
The two teams lacked realism on their way.
"In the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and mostly a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seeing in Poland and Ukraine.
The Portuguese football team, in which it has been qualified since 2010, has been qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal split from happiness in fact 90 minutes.
There is one game left and one rival -- Bosnia.
With the awareness of the Friday result (0-0) in the Hell of Bosnia Zenice, it seems clear that nothing has been won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of advantage, but it was not able to give such a rare goal that would make it easier.
"It's a good result that, however, contains a risk because we didn't go out."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will step before the audience that should create a hot cottage there, even though the match is definitely "very balanced," says the optimist, but a cleverly considering Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have a top," said a 24-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% of the chance to be on Euro 2012," the follower Carlos Queiroze relatised.
The indecisive Friday match in Bosnia forces Portugal to give goal and win.
The indecisive match can be sufficient to the Bosnians who also need to give goals.
"It is a good result that, however, contains a risk because we didn't give goal out," Bento regrets.
"We will play against a team that has great technical quality and has a great individual quality of players," he added.
Just as in Zénica, the Portuguese will be interested in developing the Bosnian team from the start of the maximum pressure so that they "will not be given time to think."
Good idea, subject to the condition that this time it turns out realistic.
