Strategy of the Republican Party against Obam re-elected
The Republican leaders have justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
Brennan’s centre, however, refers to such a fraud as a myth that the electoral fraud is less frequent than the number of people who die after a bulb hit.
The Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in the past ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the electoral participation.
In this regard, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States are responsible for organizing federal elections by individual countries.
And in this spirit, most of the American governments have declared new laws that make the electoral or recording a list difficult.
This phenomenon recorded the expansion of the elections in November 2010, during which 675 new republic representatives arrived in 26 States.
As a result, only in 2011, 180 proposals of a law restricting election law were submitted in 41 countries.
New electoral laws require the voters to present the identity of the photograph and the evidence of American nationality.
In addition, these laws limit the election period in advance, distort the right to enter into the list of voters on the day of the elections and take the election right to citizens with a record in the criminal register.
Before the elections in 2006, no American state was required by the voters to present an identifier with the photograph.
The first state that made this request was Indiana.
The Constitution of the Indian Law confirmed in 2008 the United States Supreme Court.
The Republican authorities have hurried to extend this procedure to other countries.
In the last two years, they supported the proposals for such laws in 34 countries to force the voters to present the identity of the photograph.
It should be noted that, unlike Quebec, American citizens have no universal identity, such as the card of health insurance.
In fact, there are no 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people aged to vote, no ID with a photograph issued by the government's government authority of their state.
Furthermore, there is no such ID of approximately five million new voters in 2012.
Furthermore, the required ID is often worth more than a hundred dollars.
New limitations are inappropriately affected by young people, minorities and low-income persons.
25% of the Africans, 15% of persons with income under $35,000; 18% of citizens aged 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years of age have no required identity with photos.
And that's not all.
Students who are acquainted with their tendency to democratic candidates are not authorized in a number of countries to use their identity with a photograph presented by their school.
On the other hand, the same States allow members of the hunting or fishing clubs who choose more republic candidates to use cards presented by these clubs in elections.
Until 2004, no State required a civilian document for elections.
The first request was made by Arizona.
Since 2011, approximately 12 States have adopted laws which lay down the obligation of voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly targeted to limit the number of votes from the Spanish minority.
It is important to note that two of the three Spanish have preferred the democratic party.
In 2011, the Republican Legislatives supported the laws in eight states which disrupt the record of the voters on the day of the elections.
Furthermore, they restricted the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to register.
These limitations have their consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, campaigns for recording voters were helped to register approximately 10 million inhabitants.
However, the measures taken since 2009 resulted in a decline in the recording of new voters in 2010 by 17% in comparison with 2006.
Subsequently, the Republican legislators adopted in the next five countries laws aimed at reducing the period for elections in advance.
For example, during the general elections in 2008 in Florida, the African Americans created 33% of the voters who voted in advance, although only 13% of the African American voters in this country were.
It was the same with the Hispanic.
They created only 11% of all the voters, but 24% of the citizens voted in advance.
On the other hand, the white people who represented 76% of all voters were only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Contrary to the approval of laws limiting the registration of voters, of course, democratic legislators and their supporters were very emphasized.
Democratic governors blocked their veto several proposals of law.
In order to suspend the validity of the most controversial laws, the prosecutor General of the United States even affected.
Partially, they were able to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 States accepted laws that require the presentation of identity with photos.
However, the new rules introduced completely unsupportingly impair the performance of the voting law in 2012.
Democratic criticism is mainly referring to the predictability of approved laws and considers it obviously an effort to influence the results of the elections in 2012 in key countries.
The report of Brennan Centre of 2011 shows that the countries where these laws were approved represent 171 of 270 votes in the elections necessary for victory in the presidential elections.
It is too early to declare that these legislative changes at the election system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on the electoral participation.
In this regard, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Discovery of prostate cancer: explore or not?
The PSA test produced false results that were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, which led to useless medical operations.
All this has increased the hesitation of men who have been so struggling to go to the examination.
Let yourself investigate or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
The studies conducted in the United States showed a high level of contamination among individual tested groups, thus it is difficult to interpret these results and make valuable recommendations.
Further studies, this time European, have established a different mortality among patients who have succeeded in the investigation and those who did not go after them.
These studies have also demonstrated after a 12-year distance that those who do not go to the study have 30 to 40% higher risk of metastasis.
Therefore, I recommend a 50-year-old examination, or from 40 years of age, if your direct relative had a cancer of prostate.
The more threatened group is also men of African American origin.
The key is to take the right decision as soon as cancer is discovered.
There are aggressive types of cancer and kinds that are intangible.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the danger of his type of cancer, to offer possible alternatives, not to treat prostate cancer, which has no effect on life in a long term, and to focus on active control of disease in these cases.
Today, a number of people with cancer are not treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and is not threatening their life.
We'll propose them rather to carry out an active supervision and offer them treatment in the event of a disease progress.
Still more and more accurate, we set criteria that help to decide which kind to treat and which are not.
However, I recommend that the examination be completed.
However, it is important to make an interview with your doctor and to determine whether it is appropriate to take a study or not.
In collaboration with the International Urological Company, the Movember Movember movement has created a tool that allows to evaluate for and against in relation to the PSA examination.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite the progress in the research, it seems to be the best means to reduce the risk of illness acceptance of healthy lifestyle principles.
It is estimated that if everyone eats healthy and moves enough, 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
"If everyone had stopped smoking, this data would increase at least 50%," said André Beauliu, speaker of Cancer Research Society in Canada.
On the contrary, approximately 10% of cancer disease is estimated to cause inheritance.
Some percent also remain completely unexplained.
For Cancer Research Cancer, the number of smoking is still a priority, even though the number of smokers falls.
Cigarettes are worth 85% of the case of lung cancer.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
It is extremely harmful to human health.
"It's still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," speaker André Beauliu's head.
Encouragement: 10 years after the smoker stops smoking, the risk of cancer decreases by half.
Weight
Temperature and obesity are, according to SCC, another risk factor for disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, fat intestines and endpoints, nuts, slippers and utensils.
"The research shows that regular physical activity has been protecting the whole life from the cancer of the fat womb," the report adds.
Food
The organisation also recommends that the consumption of red meat be limited.
In too high consumption, colorectal cancer may lead to increased risks.
It is suitable to avoid the invasions for which the same applies.
Conservation of meat with consumption, drying or salt may lead to the creation of carcinogenic substances.
"They may cause damage to organism cells and lead to cancer development," the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists focused on the connection between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet made clear conclusions.
Studies aimed at vitamin E are disputed according to SCC.
Although one of these finds a reduction in the risk of cancer of prostate, other studies speak more of its increase.
Even the effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beauliu continues to insist on how important it is to talk about his concerns and precedents from his family with his doctor.
"It doesn't mean you're going to have cancer."
Higgs' boson examined
The announcement of the probably discovery of Higgs' boson caused the summer of an authorized disturbance.
There is an opinion that this boson is participating in a mechanism responsible for all the material in the universe.
And this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or "at least bad" explanation of nature and mass behavior - which has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is no 100 per cent certainty among physics that it is Higgs' boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle that is very similar to Higgs' boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the large Physical Congress in Kyoto are more confirmed, but all data are missing so that we can be absolutely certain.
However, let's assume that it's Higgs' boson, because the risk of a mistake appears like a small one, and let's see what's going on.
In this world, the law is fully uncertain, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circled - and don't try too hard, otherwise you'll hurt yourself.
Even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that similar law is applicable to it: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot take the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantasy state" - this "state" is generally said to create some of their characteristics.
Furthermore, the physical particles are divided into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find organized citizens, or fermions who obediently follow Pauli's principle.
And on the other end, there are bosons, cruel anarchists, who don't respect anything -- so definitely not this principle, which means that they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons continue to be divided into two groups according to the device (by the way completely amazing), which is the Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley Labs: the meats that we leave here without notice, and the "power particles" by which the great natural forces are spread and with which Higgs' boson is probably related in some way.
However, it is necessary to say that these bosons are not as exotic animals as possible to be thought.
If you read this article, it is because of a boson with an unusual banalita: photon, or particle of light, which is the "noser" of electromagnetic power.
Because when the electric bullet particles accelerate or change their direction, it will "reset" an electromagnetic field in this particular place, just like a bullet thrown into the pond.
This "exhaust" will produce an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultrafial radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing but a photon -- and that's one of the bosons, "force carriers".
Stable fields
It's also with Higgs' boson, just with the difference that "closing" needs a different field, the Higgs field to show this boson.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; it is necessary to reach very high energy values, just like at the frozen pond level, just a lot of large cotton.
For this reason it is necessary to use such an enormous acceleration of the part as an accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large hadronic acceleration with the cords is a circle with a circle of 27 km! - to be able to develop such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is reappropriate to clarify the relationship between Higgs and the material.
With electromagnetic fields, not all particles or all materials are responding.
Some, such as magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never keep themselves on the refrigerator.
And the same thing is that with the Higgs field, not all the particles are responding: those who do so have a certain material, while others (such as a photo, let's look at it) do not have it.
And Mrs. Novok asks what all these research are for, what "we're bringing"?
In the light of science, it is to confirm the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physics to examine any disagreement between observation and SM forecasts.
In addition, few physicians literally wish to find them because the smallest difference could open the space "new physics" and heal some spaces in the model.
It is necessary to establish that the model has so far huge shortcomings, does not bring any clarification of gravity (aya!) or dark material that forms approximately 80% of the universe (again!).
However, the CERN device has not detected such a dispute so far.
Reactions
The responses of these studies in the daily life of Mrs and Mrs. Novok can only be predicted very difficult, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be none.
See: At the beginning of the 1960 ’ s, the pioneers had no laser in the Bell Laboratories or the idea of the revolution, they were already invoked by their work.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
The physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960 and created the first constant laser ray (previous pulse rays) in 1962, I have already said that - the laser was initially considered as such a "toy toy in the lab".
Just imagine...
Furthermore, the application may result from all the instruments surrounding the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small lightshot in 1969 during his work focused on optics.
This camera, even though Boyle didn't plan it at the beginning, now serves as an "o" of all the digital cameras in the world and gave him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, it doesn't mean that activities around the LHC have to change our life, but that means that people really never know...
Paliative care - The best way to get out of life... † Le Devoir
By means of its Commission for dignity dying with Quebek, he has recently involved in a challenging question about the end of his life.
The debate should continue soon and the law's proposal is now to be drafted.
There is still a lot to do in this crucial area.
The Le Devoir magazine tried to take a closer look at this question.
Nearly a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Monteregia.
The cancer of prostate that feeded him gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years of life and it's seven," he said without emotions on his bed in the house for palyative care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where the last day arrived.
"It's still a shock, you can't get ready for this," he adds.
The sickness has done its work: enormous weakness prevents him from taking himself to the bathroom or just eating himself.
He resigned to look at a tasteful breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He is courageous and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop at him, brings him medicines, offers bath.
Courage to ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of the railway, it humiliates me," he confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a medicine for his problem.
"In the whole life, a person learns that the men with urine are standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in Victor-Gadbois device.
Return to the child phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the ability of the man," whether he accepts that return, the psychologist claims.
According to the view of a number of people dealing with palyative care, the essential moments occur in the same core of such return.
Patients who enter home with palyatic care Victor-Gadbois are all suffering from cancer.
Their prognosis is at least three months of life.
In this stage, the team of doctors and sisters who take care of them does not provide so-called "treatment" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years, the worst fear of dying is "for the drowning of full consciousness".
But the sickness allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I don't have any wishes in my life," he says, and then he will allow us to put her in a breathing device.
Yet, he is still looking forward to the last visit of his son in Italy in the next days.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, volunteer groups provide body care with food.
That's how palyative care looks, which comes, if nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Québek, one bed of palyative care for 11,700 inhabitants appears.
That's very little if we realize that we all die once.
Here life continues in optimum conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home.
Whether it is a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
For example, when a person dies, it can be provided with brandy or pepsi, according to the taste.
The diabetics must no longer have sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night they wore a beer to Mr. X, who died later last night.
This morning, his son's drinking a beer to honor a dead father.
"We are helping patients as close as their neighbours," said Nathalie Savard, director of the care services.
Victor-Gadbois's home goes day after day, but they don't like each other.
In addition to a thirty - six - year - old man who rejoices with his last meeting with his family thoroughly founded on the pillows, while they give him to his honour, a tragically sixty - year - old man is dying surrounded by his parents, his wife and two small children after he tried all the possibilities to survive.
"For six months, there are always three to five beds that are designed for cancer people under 45 years," Dr. Christiane Martel said.
53% of the patients coming to Victor-Gadbois home are coming from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palyative care
It is said that 77% of the Canadians simply do not have access to palyative care, i.e. care, which is intended to mitigate suffering once the sick gets to the final stage of their life, whether it is home, in the hospital or in the custody house.
And several organisations, such as Victor-Gadbois and the Company for Home Palyatic Treatment Area Grand Montréal, are more specialized in less exclusive care for oncological patients.
And this essential inaccessibility of health care in Quebec leads to a number of doctors specializing on palyative care, fearing the adoption of the Eutanasia Act and the associated suicide.
Since October, the manifest has been signed in the area of palyatic treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they have confirmed their disagreement with such initiatives.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not sufficient to ensure access to quality palyatic care before it is possible to agree with the implementation of eutanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days on emergency in enormous pains without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
He fears that patients do not ask for death because they do not receive suitable care.
At the same time, a number of oncologists care for their patients until the last moment, regardless of the adverse prognosis.
Helène Richard's hope of survival was already minimal when she quit a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was finishing the treatment, she replayed that she was sorry that I stopped fighting, she told us.
And she told me it was over!
No Almighty Care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of the patients who wish to die thanks their doctors for not fulfilling their wishes when the palyative pussy team mitigated their pain.
However, it is necessary to say that palyatic care is definitely not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, the Paliative Care Director in the Grand Montréal Home Paliative Care Society, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
In the end of their life, doctors often use palyative sedatives that sleep until the scone, whether or not sedatives are permanently administered.
You can't face that we don't see this part of suffering.
The patient who is not getting rid of the pain will be increasingly able to access palliative sedatives.
Patients who do not provide sedatives always say the same: "I want to die."
But that doesn't always mean "I want you to give me eutanasia," it means, rather, "I want to get rid of pain."
The implementation of this report allowed a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Extensive reality scandals in Quebec
Travel management officials, businessmen in construction and public work, lobbyists of political parties and Italian mafia experts continue to tell what they know about the amazing "system" in which construction, public officials, politics, experts and mafians are involved.
This "department" came from Quebec taxpayers very expensively between 1990 and 2000.
"It is interesting how the system has broken apart since we have taken essential measures," said ironicly Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former police chief in Montreal.
It led to a scandal in 2011 on the basis of a consistent investigation aimed at counterfeiting funds in relation to road construction contracts in Quebec, which the Liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest approved after long delays.
The Duchesneau report confirmed the direct link between the industry, the non-transparent financing of the parties and the corruption of state officials.
"Before the beginning of the 2010 investigation," he says, "only the Ministry of Transport on a billion dollars orders," when some people kept their instincts on their instincts to get a share on them!
Charbonneau's commission "but led two mayors to demiss," he adds with hope that she can "cover the truth of some people".
Permanent Unit for Combating Corruption founded in 2011
The Permanent Unit for Combating Corruption, founded in 2011, is also involved in the fight against its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
In addition, Marteau's family officers have made sure that since 2009 the Montreal Monetary Cartel has significantly mitigated the pushing of orders...
In the past few weeks, they conducted a number of examinations and accused of fraud and corruption of a number of general representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of one town.
The next one on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just departed from his function of the mayor of the town of Laval, the third largest Quebec city.
He's suspected that he repeatedly accepted payments in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have already been received by transport engineers from Montreal and Italian businesses, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito caused sensation by explaining the commission the "system" mechanism of acquiring public procurement.
He himself dedicated 3% of the value of the contracts he received in Montréal, to the intermediary associated with the mafia, which then transferred the Union Montréal side, for which Mayor Gerald Tremblay had been running.
After 2000, Zambito was generous to all parties and dedicated more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, but in particular to the Liberals who were then in power.
He also admitted that he organized illegal finance search for former Liberal Vice-Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Procurements with monetary guides overflowing prices
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was functioning very well.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described it very detailedly before the committee: for ten years he received gifts from construction companies, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and pockets in total $766,000 in exchange for money-water contracts.
Other public factors in the transport sector have admitted that they have been allowed to pay rewards for overestimating the invoices by 30% to 40% through untrusted multiworks.
The Mayor's Officer, Martin Dumont, then accused Tremblaye of keeping his eyes closed over the concurrent budget that brought dirty money into his treasure.
Based on these discoveries, Tremblay departed in the beginning of November, by throwing Montréal into a large crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal Members who issued a warning signal.
As the mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies region in the east of the island has already been planted against the sale of the general land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promotors directly in the middle of a prosperous property shop.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be launched, says that "waits for threads in trying to understand the functioning of the ants' system to stop gangrene and grab the guilty."
The process is, according to it, "a painful but positive."
We are at the stage of cleaning the wound, but we need to set up a own investigative unit in Montréal and ensure surveillance that these doubtful practices cannot be restored.
It's like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public actors have removed hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly afraid of the roles of "messengers informed about this lyrics" if they are not weakened in these chairs!
It estimates that 70% of the funding of the election campaigns in Québek comes from dirty money, and it adds with ironia, "I heard it was just a weak courage of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit the gifts to $100, but he believes it will not solve the situation: "As far as the election costs are strictly limited, dirty money from politics will not disappear."
It proposes a comprehensive control of the public procurement system and the funding of the parties: "No more we cannot fall down; if we focus boldly on the essence of things, we can rebuilding on stronger grounds and with greater control and enforcement of laws."
If this story has blackened the picture of Quebec and Montreal in abroad, Duchesneau recommends everyone who laughs at him to look at their own courtyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you and PSG have put a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by having all individuals gone to each other, or by a completely new dimension of PSG.
Great players came to us.
Every day, I keep going next to them.
Technical team helped me too.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the game level.
And it's easier at the games.
It's all going so fast in football.
I'm not losing my head.
From my beginnings in the preparation in INF Clairefontaine until after the entry to Saint-Etienne, I have always moved on a single degree.
So you're using the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti introduced...
Incrementals from this summer are used to play games at very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it shows that a player like me has a more taste to combat and wants to give the maximum performance.
Plus, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position.
He's got assistants like Claude Makelele who played on the same post as I did.
And does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all the techniques.
Today he has no equality in the 1st League and belongs to the best European coaches.
He has enormous experience, and with the top teams, he's got a lot of titles.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he'll win another titles in Paris.
In January, I graduated with him a comforting conversation.
I had a number of injuries behind me.
The confidence that he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you view the first part of the PSG season?
In Lisa 1, Lyon took our lead position.
But we're still in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the League of Masters: we have made a very easy step to the 8-final.
What's your club's target in this competition?
Let's try to go as far as we can.
Now anything can happen.
But we certainly want to be a hard rival for the quality European teams.
We want to win our qualification group first before Port, so we can play the 8-final revenge at home.
Can PSG become a large European club in a short-term horizon?
The budget's already...
In order to become a large European club, Paris has to win titles and write into history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial page, PSG has funds to achieve this intention.
And would it be a great failure not to win in the 1st League like last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win a league title this year.
We've missed enough in last season.
We were disappointed in May because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We collected 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had a season even more amazing.
I think it's gonna work this year.
Even though big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux also seek the title, I think we have weapons available to defeat them.
Do you think the PSG media expect too much?
It's not unusual to expect much from us with regard to what was invested here and what players we have.
We're totally accepting that.
It's the fact that if we defeat Troys 4:0 at home and there's still something that they're making up in our papers, it's not very pleasant.
A person asks what more people can want from you.
Of course, it's not about winning 4:0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set a game style.
You need time to build a team.
In Lisa of Masters, we've been able to play.
Look at Manchester City, who hasn't run into the 8-final season for the second season, and they have also invested large amounts!
Given the invested sums, you could expect you to have 15 points ahead of the other!
You insult the other clubs and the French League.
The Lyon and Marseille Clubs, who failed too much in the last season, moved with the new PSG to another phase.
That shows how great the 1st League is.
I hope we can smile in May and say that, despite all the difficulties, we have managed to win.
It seems as if PSG lies in everything on the performances of Goldan Ibrahimovice.
It's good to say there's "dependence on Golden".
That means that Ibrahimovic is very effective and gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and proves he's a star of the 1st League.
Everywhere he passed, he proved to be a big player, a world star.
We respect man and players in our team.
He also respects the people he has around.
What he has accomplished is really unique.
This also led to increasing their own level of game.
Thiago Silva, who belongs to the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow around.
How did you live with Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like disappointment.
I really wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately, I couldn't play as I imagined.
But I experienced it, and I got stronger.
I can play good fights today.
And that's what I've been hoping to do since I came to the representative.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to make our appearance an example.
How do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps headed by the national team?
They're talking results for him.
We're in a good place in the MS qualification.
The coach chooses strictly, he's close to the players, and he can inspire for victory.
Laurent Blanc was the same.
But I don't want to compare them.
Blanc has achieved his goal by qualifying for Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil.
Is the remise (1:1) of 16 October in Spain a solid starting match?
This game gave us a sense of self-consciousness.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I've never seen this game for my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and costs for processing between recipients.
In addition, as often true in these technologies, there is a clear political view: the belief that the existing financial system built on bank monopols leads to financial crisis.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudo), represents as virtual money (but translated to dollar, euro...), so secure transmission protocol like BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between partners.
Thanks to 15,000 computers involved in the network have already been registered at approximately 200 000 transactions.
Approximately a thousand websites already accept bitcoines as gifts or payments.
The bitcoin course first reached the maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to 2 dollars, today it moves on the border of about $10 (transview of courses is listed on the bitcoincharts.com page).
In comparison with the world's exchange for real money or financial products, it's nothing impressive.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in the fact in its report on virtual finances that came out in October.
Bitcoin calls "the most successful virtual money", "contesting dollar and euro" and "the period of ordinary money".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money by being used as "credit" for progress in a video game that a person gets a game or can buy (and leckdy and back).
The Facebook social network has also developed a similar system.
However, each month, the Central Authority shall monitor and process individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all the networks are the depositors of the book of common accounts, controllers, emissions of money and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two electronic addresses using an e-mail.
However, the user may choose a different address for each payment, providing anonymity.
The information file related to this transaction is electronically signed by the encryption system with a double key.
The network may thus verify the legality of the transaction.
With the content of the file, it is further possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of common accounts distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is in the record of this new transaction in this book.
It takes place by resolving the mathematical task given to computers whose solver, some temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional line.
This is the phase of the cutting of the file; i.e. the transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "contribute" this new transaction and add a number to it, then they only "sect."
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (a good zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes can easily check its correctness.
The transaction shall then be indestructiblely displayed connected to the chain of all other transactions; any adjustment would change the print.
If the user wants to pay twice the same money very quickly (in ten minutes), the network will only confirm one of the two transactions - the second will be abandoned because each of them has a different print.
The computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this remuneration shall be shared regularly by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in the circulation is so limited to the number of 21 million, but they can be divided to a hundred million, so the margin space is here...
The difficulty of the task set is also increased by the increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its rises and falls.
Web sites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and an exclusion of stored bitcoin.
"Used sculina does not apply to the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paimium, a real money-payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibility of washing dirty money through this anonymous service.
But this problem is also true for cash.
Significant players like Wikipedia reject gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Constitution in Israel recently analysed the book of common accounts and proved that almost 80% of Bitcoins did not fly.
In November, the "great discounts" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul to turn bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the pedagogical book on these money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is an equivalent credit card (with real money) or without contact with the mobile, but he uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are cheaper.
Furthermore, the carrier manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easily set up with traders where it is not necessary to install new terminals or software.
All you need to do is tell the address that you can "fotograf and recognise", says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question the hierarchical systems and the transition to more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin settles, it'll take a while, but 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.
In addition, the ECB assumes the overview of the various risks that are considered to be increased today, if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French units left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and US units should follow at the end of 2014.
It's time for the Afghan army to take over their territory and choose their own future and not expect anything from us.
The greatest injury was suffered by people in the Afghan village that we were punishing because we thought they were terrorists.
And we also, because we lost 88 soldiers killed, and all those wounds and crushing.
The Talibans are composed of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often the villagers who deny the presence of foreign armies as in the Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though the Jehadians, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbek, Tadžiks joined them.
Now the tolerants experience and the frequent help of local rebels, but if the Western forces withdraw, their support will fall down.
The departure of the French units from the Nijrab base, which I watched from the top of the mountains placed by the Mandolans thanks to the French loans, took place.
The convoys of trucks and pencil vehicles arrived in Kabul without attack for the air escort of helicopters.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban will not be so active in Kabul.
The conditions have significantly changed since their unstoppable procedure in 1994 to 1996.
The cabul was then empty and the land was in the blood and fire due to fighting between the various combat groups.
Their oversight over the country was then considered to be their type of release, return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price for the darkness of these rurals, who are fully controlled by the Al-Ka'id organization, but their situation has not improved until now.
The former Mujahedins, the Afghan government and the current Talibans agree in an effort to maintain women in a subject position.
The main ministers of war against Soviet units returned to power in 2001.
They became businessmen, authorized state lands that sold as construction lands to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge American contracts for suppliers.
They were discredited; most of them have never been in battle.
According to what I heard in campaigns, people want a government that will not create thiefs.
A number of young people want to leave like those who have been able to use American generosity: the escape of capital is significant.
Young people are already tired of war and related ideology.
During the exile in Iran or Pakistan, they recognized the modern world, and its advantages took them away.
About 65% of the population is younger than 25 years; now 5 million people live in Kabul, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, public schools are full, girls and boys go there.
These young people will need to provide jobs, they do not want to return to the darkness of the previous parties or to corrupt some representatives.
Everyone, including armed opposition, likes mobile phones; television and Turkish series that show modern world, watch everywhere.
The army's already here.
Will the authorities that will stand in her forehead be considered legitimate?
Former leaders of the Soviet Army are already renewing provincial militions that will be out of control of central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainized country with a strong influence of local identity, should be awaiting a certain degree of decentralization according to the Western States model, but the United States wanted to convert it into centralised become a strong presidential influence, so there was an abolition of the post of the Prime Minister that existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964.
The President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially when elections are planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been significantly dependent on foreign assistance since the 50 ’ s and earlier years.
No industry has been able to renew, no barrier is working, no major inflammation system has been fixed.
Everything is imported; nothing is made, only fruit and vegetables.
The advantage is a private initiative.
In the country destroyed for three decades of wars, government infrastructure control would be necessary.
The news is that Afghanistan has a huge incremental wealth.
And it just made it feel that the Western States were here just to make it better.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper in place and without means for transporting raw materials across the mountains, no growing processing can run.
The Chinese have already left the mine on Mes Aynak copper and have left international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the possibility to explore a wide range of Buddhist areas to maintain the role of the most important employer in the province.
One day, it will also be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depends on the majority of imports and exports, renew normal relations.
The departure of French fighting units was completed on November 20th.
The new collaboration agreement envisages the continuation of common aid types: girls and boys lycea, French cathedrals in universities, French Institute, military, legal, health and agricultural areas, support for archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which has been cancelled in 2012, but has achieved a numerous French non-governmental organization of a number of successes in the field of common interest and agricultural recovery steps in the dozen mountain villages.
These jobs, involving the number of local workers, have helped to suppress the rebellion: inflammation, wells, drinking water, forestry, fruit trees, land protection and enlargement of the processing area.
What memories will we keep after two billion euros of military expenditure?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions that are very difficult in these valleys that are often at altitude of over 2,000 m.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural assistance from local communities in the Kapisa province.
In order to free these farmers from the rebellion of foreign groups, they wish to achieve small civilian assistance in their favour, which would be properly controlled and directly touched.
Difficulty work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Mursí started the next poker party.
While Egypt remains the most divided in his history for the publication of a constitution which temporarily gives him unlimited powers, he decided to play a bab.
In the Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the opinion of all others, that the Constitutional Meeting will approve the final text tomorrow.
A few weeks ago, the head of the State gave this meeting another two months to complete the necessary work.
For nearly two years, Egypt uses a transparency text that has been repeatedly supplemented, which weakens the constitutional stability of the country and leads to legal assumptions.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the diversity of the country.
From the view of opposition, the president remains in his "autocratic deliria", continues "violating his word" and "crewing the right."
However, his advocates assure that it is a means to turn the constitutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
There should be a referendum in two weeks.
It is a very short time segment that will make the Brotherhood resign from the intention of the text to the Egyptians to explain the article after the article.
It is also a way for the president to re-establish national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country rejects protests.
As he confirmed in the interview for the American week Time, Muhammad Mursi seemed to be convinced that the Egyptians would vote for.
Especially because this rapidly organised vote is constructed by the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: "You will approve my text, or I will keep unlimited powers", which should otherwise be terminated after the approval of the new Constitution.
And in this special air yesterday 85 Members of the introductory meeting, with a large majority of Islamicists, approved the text.
Most liberals were missing in the vote.
In mid November, shortly before the constitution was released, they broke the doors with no possibility to make their views.
The defenders of human rights, civil society or members of religious minorities imitated their step.
To achieve acquisition, 11 of the substitutes were quickly completed yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brotherhood.
It will not be surprised that articles of the constitution were often voted unanimously.
The commentators further stopped on the fact that one of the few disputes was rolling around that day... the prayer class when some members of the committee had the opinion that the hours in the meeting room were not correctly arranged.
The text that was already voted last night consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, eventually remains consistent with the version of the 1971 Constitution and provides that "the principles of the law of the chariya are the main source of law".
Salaphist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, have hoped that they would replace the term "the principles" with a term "the rule", which would allow more strict application.
For Islamists, again, the fact that this article has not been repaired represents the mark of their good will and respect against the other part of the Egyptian society.
"His hypocrisy," proposes Liberals who see only a speech problem.
They say that the islamation of the constitution is carried out through other articles.
In particular, they focus on Article 220, which entrusts the al-Azhar University's advisory role, in particular for the control of compliance with laws with the law of the chariya.
According to Egyptian expert Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing, because "persons called for expression are not chosen and have no democratic legitimacy.
It can be seen in the beginnings of theocracy."
The fear of Liberals even more excites the fact that the next university rektor should be less moderate than the existing.
"No concrete religious consequence has yet occurred.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulama, but university workers, many of them have studied in French schools," the mild concerns of Alexis Blouet, who is preparing the work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, it agrees that "this may be disputes on the interpretation of Article 220, as the terms used in it belong to the religious dictionary.
There is, in particular, a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic Legal Science, Code.].
And in the future, the question of how eligible civil judges are to be able to express themselves."
The approved text yesterday is very criticised, except for religious sites, because of the enlarged powers he grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brotherhood insists that their significant limitations have occurred against the former regime.
Another dispute place: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wish of the representatives of the army, the verification of the budget for the defence shall not be carried out by Parliament but by the National Defence Council.
Thereafter, the military courts will not forbid the treatment of civilians, as required by the Human Rights Association.
This association speaks about the text that they believe to be directed against freedom, on their doubts.
The punishment of crushing is preserved and the insult is still prohibited, which may have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Furthermore, no article is concerned with the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef from the Human Rights Watch organization.
It considers that the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word has not been mentioned in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was to perform a television speech last night, this afternoon the manifestations are scheduled.
The head of the state will then show on Saturday.
In Israel, the Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, poops of the world and sea from saturated salt solution
The promised earth connects the size of Bible truths, modern comfort, and the intact of nature.
The AAF identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Blood Holy Places
To visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that all who enter this “bath ” will come down by God's mercy.
And Galilee - instead of Jesus ’ miracles: Water change in wine at the wedding, walking by water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here Jesus also appeared to his disciples and after resurrection.
But most holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers here will pass the path of pain, or Jesus ’ crossway (Latinish Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonio - Pretoria - where the court was held, walks through the streets of the Old City and leads to the temple of God's grave at the Mount Golgota - to the crossing place, to the rock of anointedness and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian puppy of the world that symbolizes human salvation.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where, according to the Christian legend, a tree from which they made a cross to Jesus ’ crossing.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place for the Jews - the wall of crying, the rest of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to the tradition, people of different confessions leave notes with wishes that will then be fulfilled.
Pass the vertical path
The ruin of the fortress of Masada remained from a secret hiding from the enemy Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
The ruin is located on the hills in the mountains in a vicinity of 450 m above the sea level.
Only those who deal with mountains can reach it by their own forces.
The rest of this historic mountain will carry a chain.
And in the northern country, 1600-2040 m height is located in the famous ski center of Hermon, which is experienced by a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
To this ski paradise, the tourists are transported from the hill of a skiing bus.
The total length of the mountain conveyors is 45 km.
According to ancient legends, the pagan gods were allegedly living on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit all during one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, surely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near Knesset (Parlament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or scrolls from the Dead Sea, found in the caves of the Judic desert, and approximately 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel-Aviv is also worth visiting.
In his exposure, the impressionists and expressionists of Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matiss, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso are widely represented by their plates.
In Akkon, you can visit the Al Bash Museum, which presents visitors with several old Turkish bath rooms with users and bathroom nurses from that time.
In Caesarea, a visit to a unique private museum of Ralli, where you can admire the statues of Dali and Roden.
There are no guides or suvenir trades.
The entrance is free and the gifts are strictly rejected.
The Fifth Museum - the Museum of Holocaust, or Yad Vashem in Tel Avivo - tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built on the memory of 1,5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You get in, and you'll find yourself in the darkness.
Stars brighten.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the lands in which they died.
Ukraine is also introduced.
Improve Your Health
Three major bathroom centres of Israel are located on the coast of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea.
Each of them offers pools, aquaparks, dolphinaries and oceans.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea, you can bathe even in winter months, because the water temperature does not fall below 21 degrees of Celsia and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and people bath in it all year.
The dead sea, by the way, is the most unusual sea in the world, is located in the lowest land point of the planet - at the level of 417 m below the sea level.
Azur water in it is a satisfied salt solution which easily maintains on the level and those who do not know how to swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealisticly beautiful.
In order to be subjected to therapy with salt water - salts, and the medicinal mud that can treat dermatitide health problems, allergies, asthma, examination, arthritis, inflammation of air, diabetes to heal the feelings of nerves.
Touch the Mysterious Age
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Avivu - the town of Jaffa on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.
Through them a famous seaway connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The mention of this city is in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, the place where Noah built his arch, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which they had a long and happy life together.
Tourists really love towels with narrow streets named after signs of animals.
They say if you press the walls in the street of your "your" sign, your happiness will be favorable.
In Jaffa, you may meet new spouses coming here from all over Israel and even from other countries to take pictures.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk in the Roman theatre and "fetch" the fortress of the crossmen.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the headquarters of Roman prosecutors, including Pilate Pontian.
A carefully reconstructed theatre is being used for tonight’s night concerts and opera show.
Tourists, to speak
If you're going to Israel, you don't have to worry about your imperfect English: about 30% of the Russian population speaks in this country.
It's better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for the shekels (now it's $1, approximately 3,8 shekel).
The city’s transport is especially buses, but in Jerusalem, it drives a fast tramway and in the city of Haifa is the only line of the metro in the country with six stations connecting the lower city to the upper.
It's basically the underground lane trail.
The travel of all types of urban public transport is worth 6 shekels for which you can drive 1,5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, in Israel, Saturday Saturday is celebrated.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturday, it stops working on markets, shops and public transport.
And Sunday morning starts a working week.
In many cafés, restaurants and hotels, you will only get a basket food: except for pig meat, sea fruits, fish without bowls and foods that contain milk and meat combinations.
They offer a large selection of foods from lamb and beef, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish cash hummus, variety of sauce, milk meat bullets - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no dogs on the streets of Israel.
That's why there's a lot of fed cats that gracefully "touch according to their taste."
In the evening hours, you can see them asleep on the roofs of parked cars.
The outdoor cats love people's places, and they are eager to come into every kindness.
The car loan will cost from 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And borrowing the bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
The tickets to the museum are on average 30 shekels.
Expressed numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Knowing the country and rest have been accepted by the most citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The promised country visited from January to October 2012 to 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before visas were cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Power" will notify it to Moscow: the emigrants will save their money for language
While the Members and the Protectors of Human Rights are still debating the law on mandatory language tests, frauders who sell "fake" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Moscow, Petrograd, and other Russian cities come to Moscow every year by 13 million foreign workers.
Most of them are Central Asia citizens: Uzbekistan, Tadžikistan, Turkmenia.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, the law has been effective, according to which each working migrant will be obliged to test the knowledge of Russian.
This rule is currently applicable only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and community economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, the FMS promises that the relevant tests will in time be mandatory for all visitors.
However, tests will consist not only of language knowledge but also of Russian history and the basis of law.
The knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed to obtain and extend the work permit.
Exception only applies to citizens of countries where Russian is official.
This law is not subject to people who have successfully achieved the astacy and have obtained academic diploma in the fall of the SSSR in 1991.
Contribution, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of test sites will work under the protection of the Puskinov Institute of Russian, the University of Friendship between the nations, the Moscow State University, the State University in St. Petrohrad and other Russian high schools.
Migrants can compose tests in all cities; now more than 160 such centres are opened in Russia.
The initiative for supporting the introduction of testing has also been supported by Members of State pride and FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law entered into force, the human rights defenders could ask many questions in the press: what does that actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for visitors themselves?
First of all - the representatives of the migration services respond - will reduce the number of people suffering as a result of "slave work".
Many today talk about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the President of the FMS of Russia in Tadžikistan Victor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be started before they left.
The only system of organised labour will allow from 90% to solve foreign workers' problems.
There are problems with emigrants without caution, without education who don't know the language and have no medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - says Sebelev - the future migrant is condemned to confront unfair people who will be able to provide him with "instruction" in the horrible, close residence, where he and dozens of others, like him, will suffer for months without food and papers, and will spend 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get many complaints from our migrant workers.
"In their country, they promise one thing, but when they arrive, they cheat them, they entertain their passports, they don't pay their promised remuneration," confirms the Chief Tagian Office of Work Migration MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't put it on!
By lessing that many citizens of the Central Asian Republics who intend to go to Russia recognize that they do not only know the language of the country they want to get into, but have no experience even with the work.
Of course, it is not even their fault, rather their unfortunate: only very few Turkmens, Uzbeki, Tadžiks can afford to acquire at least proper basic education.
Because their families also need to feed their children, not speaking of the fact that it is necessary to dress, dress, and to equip school.
As children grow up to a productive age, they need to work at first opportunity.
Without knowledge of language, it's hard - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and less valuable."
It is true that, in view of the law on language tests, the protectors of human rights point to one important thing.
The test will only be performed in those migrants who have legal positions.
If they don't have it, they won't even make tests or get any other official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or unprovoked entrance forbidden"
Many of the incoming employees claim that getting official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
Legalization also costs money: from 12 to 16,000 rubles.
But false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police employees know that we basically have fake documents, without registration, and that's what the extortion cases are.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, a tea," - the journalists shared their experience with the Tadžikistan citizens Umed Chuškadamov.
"Come on, don't be greedy, buy a painting."
On the first day of validity of the language law, it has been found that falses are not only documents of migrant registration.
FMS employees have already taken a few false certificates of language testing.
Fake documents are printed on a normal color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get free: each migrant in hope that it would facilitate the examination of the tests has paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
That's two and a half times higher than the official test execution: it will cost migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the nearest future is to ensure that the system is prevented from corruption so that the workers cannot easily buy documents, including government officials and human rights defenders.
Government authorities may yet promise foreign workers who have failed to test for the first time, required time to graduate the Russian basis course.
In visitors who do not speak Russian, they are expected to work in areas where there is no need to deal actively with people.
MVD (Internal Ministry) does not take into circulation an illegal arms market
The share of criminal acts with the use of legally held weapons is very low
MVD Russia presents a proposal for a elaboration of the law in relation to the owners of civil weapons.
It is the reaction of government authorities to recent events: the incitement of the wedding shootings, which hanged without victims, and the massacre prepared by the Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinograd, which resulted in seven people.
The police want to prohibit wearing dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which we can get a weapon license from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the committee of pride for security and the fight against corruption of Irina Jarovaya, who promised that the change in the weapons law will be submitted by the State Dume in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian governments are trying to deal with the problem with the path of "whispering the screws".
A open letter appeared in the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organisations - require the rejection of the "insensitive improving" of the law.
The percentage of huliganism with registered weapons is minimum, said Vasilij Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminal in the interview with the Russian BBC edition.
According to the data of the Ministry of Interior in six months 2012, 142 criminal acts were committed with the use of firearms registered in the Ministry of Interior, while a total of 1168 000 criminal acts were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the elaboration of civil weapons legislation will not take the perpetrators to go to the "black" market.
According to them, we can now find any weapon at a low price in Moscow.
Currently, the Ministry of Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
"Black" market with weapons is supplied with several channels.
The main channels are five, says the colonel in the service of Victor Baranec, who has been working at the Ministry of Education and General Office for ten years.
Screenshot pages that accept weapon orders
The first of them -- "a armed or military road," that means a weapon that was distracted during the fights on the Kavkaze.
"The weapons were also stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says the Lamb.
Another type of black weapons are the weapons stolen by criminals in security forces.
The Lamb explains that thefts from police warehouses and weapons stealed directly from criminal authorities.
Illegal "mainly" gets to sell from military warehouses.
Many warehouses often have explosions.
"It has been proven that some fires have been set up deliberately - so that manka can be covered," said the former soldier.
They bring their contribution according to Barance and the manufacturers of weapons.
"There are private armed enterprises that are not competitive in the international market, and they are exhausting the weapons that are delivering to the black market, including Moscow," the expert said.
Another source of "black" market is fracture.
Especially a number of guns and machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There's their production, sometimes weapons are manufactured here in malproduction, and there was a mafia that organised their fuel production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts compiled the approximate share of individual sources of illegal weapons supplies on the "black" market.
The report on this issue was processed in 2011 by the Centre for Analysis of Problems and Projecting Public Administration.
Specialists discussed the reports of the Ministry of Interior and the Russian Statistics Office, Criminal Literature and public data portals focused on the theme of weapons.
Most of the illegal weapons, according to researchers, originate from military and executive authorities.
Half of all weapons were found in the black market "willing of official factors whose work is associated with weapons," the report says.
According to the data available by researchers, 17% of weapons from armed conflicts originated, 14% of cases of stealing weapons in their production, 5% is "black archeology".
The seller-consultant of one of the arms shops that asked us not to introduce his name is convinced that weapons found in black digging "archaeology" are no longer buying -- they are simply too old.
Most often, as he says, sellers ride for new shipments directly to military warehouses.
Despite the stakeholder, the entrepreneur will buy a unit, like a TT gun.
You order a gun with him and he'll sell it to you over the fence.
"He will take it to the city and sell it for 900 euros for a piece of two tanks," he says.
"The truth is that the police are well in the image, and that's why every time they start burning up their plan in the clarification of criminal acts, they make a control purchase from illegal arms traders," the advisor adds.
"As in a luxury store"
Sellers sell themselves with a buyer most often across their famous.
I visited the websites and blogs until a guy showed up who offered me an opportunity to go to the "Testing" platform, where a man would lead me to the "angle", where we would be working together.
I've learned the price mainly there.
Military rapporteur Victor Baranec
If I want to get a weapon, I need a friend who knows the way out, he tells me a seller, a consultant. I have a familiar, but I don't trust him fully.
The salesmen are on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically, "of Mr. Ivan Ivanovic, who asked me to make sure that his daughter had fallen out of the teeth."
And now I'll get there through a man I'm sure.
He's going to deliver them to me, too, because he knows I'm not going to give it to me.
The starters are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Victor Baranec tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid - 1990s when he was processing a state for publication on this subject.
The scheme did not change according to his words.
They gave him an album with photos where it was "everything you thought."
"I felt like a luxury store," the soldier recalls.
The buyer, according to the Barnes, does not offer rabbits in the bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, I just don't buy-- we go with the seller to the woods and build a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I'm convinced that the gun is shooting well, we're starting to act," says the expert.
Tray on the couch
Searchers will bring you on the web sites and groups on "Intact", where you will be offered to buy weapons "for various purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required to do so.
"We're just gonna have a certain amount of money," they say in the advertising title on the website "Buy a wargun or automat."
On these pages, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And selling to teenagers?
"Absolutely without license," the user "Ivan" is asked (the spell is preserved).
"I'm buying TT.Moscow" - a short formulation of the Fedorenkov requirement.
The Federal Security Service has recently broken down a huge network of web sites and people who wish to buy military weapons can bury with a shovel.
People are starving like hungry fish for bait, and then they get carbons in Siberia.
Military rapporteur and higher military officer Victor Baranec
I have heard of these schemes: Web sites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People are taking orders.
The buyer will pay through the bankomate.
"In response to this, the seller will send him a photograph and a description of the guidelines where the weapon is hidden," says the press speaker of the non-governmental organization "Right to Weapons" Dmitri Kislov.
Victor Baranec confirms that you can stay without weapons after you have orders on the website and find yourself behind the nets.
The Federal Security Service has recently broken down a huge network of web sites and people who wish to buy military weapons can bury with a shovel.
"People get like hungry fish on bait and then get coal in Siberia," he confirms.
Makar's for $100.
When you buy illegal shooting weapons, you pay the amount of the experts usually from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislova from the NGO's "Right to Weapons", you're going to charge Makarov's gun for $100 to 300.
You have to wait a month to a month and a half.
Weapons shall be expedited from warehouses to long-term storage through median stocks.
According to the official statistical office, the number of these crimes in Russia was 7% down in comparison with the January period - October 2011 and totally 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of explanated cases of stealing and blackmailing weapons, guns, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, fastfood and supermarket workers strike
The work on a treasure operational "McDonald" will be through until a quarter of all American teenagers
In the last days, a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart's supermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into the nineth wave or whether it will soon disappear.
The whole share is supported by Unions and a number of left-handed social organizations.
In addition to the increase in the modest salaries received by a number of workers in Walmart and in rapid rehearsal systems, the goal of protesters is to achieve the creation of them in their commission organisations.
This economic sector is currently practically intacted by the expert movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week after Thanksgiving Day, on so-called "black Friday", when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, caught millions of inhabitants, and in some cases it was accompanied by fighters.
On this day, some workers, Walmart, who work on 2.2 million people around the world, have left their workplaces and demonstrated together with Unions and levic activists of transnational trade chains companies whose goods are designated to people from lower and medium class.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from pens across hunting guns and car batteries to suckers, eggs and milk.
Products in his sales are average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many employees with low remuneration in Walmart sales only buy at work.
The availability and sorting of goods made Walmart one of the biggest companies in America.
According to the critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply partly because they only pay little for their employees.
They also complain about bad working conditions, such as lack of automatic wheelchairs or manual scanners.
The demonstrators demanded an increase in payments for "black Friday" and complained that the health insurance costs provided by the company increased rapidly from $30 to 100 a month.
The typical Walmart employee gets $9.5 an hour, but that doesn't match the cost, say employees.
Scientists from the University of California in Berkeley say that if Walmart increases the average remuneration to $12 an hour, it will cost $3,2 billion a year.
It's a average of 1.1% more than this company charges now.
If Walmart moves a full increase of remuneration to consumers' shoulders, each visit to the sales will only cost 46 cents more.
In a year, customers will spend approximately $12.39 more than today.
Walmart's defenders point out that the protest was held only in nine countries, and the company should not almost cause any damage.
"Black Friday" in the sales companies lasted from 8 hours at night on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5000 items of goods per second.
In total, her treasures carried out on "black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The representative of the company Dan Fogelman stated in the interview for the left-to-sized Huffington Post website that the jobs left totally " less than five" employees of Walmart, and that the protest was all over the "continued media sensation" organised by the sites.
"Uncontained treasure!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their goals were not Walmart's business houses (they are not too popular in that progressive city, so they are almost not here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he's selling billions of porceles, and then he doesn't even pay you the hospital and he doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, City Council member in New York
Currently, it is a minimum pay for work in accordance with federal laws and regulations of the State of New York $7.25 per hour.
Fastfood restaurants gradually increase this remuneration, but only mildly, and in the average they receive their series of employees in New York 8,90 dollars per hour.
In this expensive city, no one has lower remuneration.
I don't understand how you can exist in New York for such money.
With McDonald's employee, nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work behind a school board for a partial job and live with their parents.
Only few people see their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for a long time.
At present, I'm constantly meeting in an interview with McDonald workers who complain that they have to live from these money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, Wall Street Journal has a comment that the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children unless you know how to feed them.
Participants of the protests that started on Thursday at "McDonald" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that treasure and cooks in rapid meals start getting at least $15 per hour, which is more than double of their current minimum wages.
They also demanded that the sibling organisations be established in the sphere of rapid refreshment.
The American laws prohibit the management of preventing the establishment of committee organisations and punishing committee activists by harassment and release.
On the other hand, the governance rarely makes their lives easier.
However, introducing a rapid refreshing organisation is complex for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusual high fluctuation of employees.
Disagreement
This day there were noise protests in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The summit of the event was at the afternoon meeting at the "McDonald" near the Times Square, where several local democratic politicians, especially a member of the City Council, Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald" said he's selling billions of porces, and then he doesn't even pay you for your fair work."
The demonstrators also looked forward to supporting other famous New York Democrats, such as the candidate for the mayor of Billa de Blasio, who said that "we must join together in support of fastfood workers in order to achieve fair rewards for their work and economic prosperity that each New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described, it was the biggest event of his species in the history of the American Sphere of Fast Refreshment.
But only a few hundred people attended it, even though not all of them were rapid rehearsal employees who hired tens of thousands in New York.
Whether this event becomes an illustration that lights the flame of mass movement, it is not clear yet.
"So far, the brain fails averagely."
A popular topic of widespread reality is among modern technology fans of virtual reality; in recent times it means seeing the world especially through the potatoes of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, the Google work model introduced at its annual conference, and in November it was announced that the application for the corresponding patent was also submitted by Microsoft.
The interaction with the interactive group of 3D technologies in the Cambridge Lab Microsoft Sharam Izadim shows that the scientists of this company are already past.
It is a perspective of manipulation with virtual objects in the air with holy hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us the framework what your research group is dealing with?
- We're dealing with human interactions with machines, but at the same time we're trying to move the border of this interaction.
The humanity has stuck at the stage of work with pixels on the flat screen, at times touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look forward for 5-10 years and foresee significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect shooter - it's a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sensors, because for everyone is a very interesting option of managing with gestures.
- What else is going on in the future?
- Despite the fact that Kinect system has transmitted interaction to the physical level, very many interactions continue to take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output flow is not yet particularly.
We're trying to change it, we're working on really three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projectives.
You need to enter the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
However, for this purpose, it is necessary to know not only the users but also the area around them.
Then we will be able to complement virtual objects in a much more appropriate way into the real world.
And first, hell with those stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think of voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it valuable?
- It is certainly not possible to be considered as anything - a matter of privacy is raised, because we do not always want to inform the others in our surroundings about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, we had a project in which we were thinking about gestures, but not for the thoughtful, just for such coated, short.
The gesture would not be taken by a camera device, but by a bracelet that would watch the bones and muscle movements.
So far it's big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the bracelet clock.
But generally, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- How do you ask me to give you this lemonade?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to force the user to adapt to what the machine can or cannot at the moment?
- That's not necessary at all, but it's an interconnection.
I think in the near future, we will have to work primarily on developing new types of sensors that can be more accurate in examination of human responses.
For example, these can be laser sensors that provide relatively good depth resolution, which is very important.
- To talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there a distinction, a depth or something else today?
- In fact, the current generation - that's what we can do in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just mega-pixels, it's like mathematics and depths.
In the present view of the matter, all current technologies are insufficient for us - that allocates work to algorithm designers.
So we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also the Z.
So very important is also the speed, the number of pictures in a second.
Human movement is relatively dynamic and current data flows of 30 images per second are frankly said a little bit, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes made a toucher from our Lab in Redmond with a configurable delay in 1 to 100 ms, while the current, serially manufactured sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of a man with the machine.
It would be very useful for me at work, but I just don't need so much touch, but I need some photos in an extra second.
- And no need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect system is now using three "camers", one of which is actually a infrared transmitter and the second - the receiver of the reflected signal.
And already a third camera -- that's actually the usual scan of the visible zone.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or worsening it because it would increase the necessary amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, play with the curve of the location of the cameras and see how it will help to determine the three-dimensional position.
- If I remember well, Microsoft (in contrast to Google) did not present his glasses publicly.
Don't you think that about the daily use of technologies extended by special glasses, it is one of the most promised platforms?
- Of course walking and keeping the smartphone in the hands raised is not very comfortable, but I think the strongest option would be the "transportable" form of the proliferation of reality when it would be possible to switch any time from the glasses to the smartphone, the projection screen and then around.
The glasses - it's a very personal device, and it's their strength (private things only you see), and at the same time weakness - expanded reality on the basis of the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation with virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also to the normal mortal.
There is one problem to which criticians often point: there is no touch response!
Hands don't smell anything!
What answers are your group preparing for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the widespread reality -- that's the seventh walking break in interaction between man and machine.
I think the completion of the muscle concepts could be an eighth breakdown.
Meanwhile, one of the interesting tricks is used - the use of the second hand as a kind of basis for displaying.
It records the press in an excellent way!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding the massability of these "images in the air" -- for example, interference with several directional ultrasonic lightnings in the defined point where the finger is located, causes a massive sense, but it's still very weak -- as if you're blowing on a thumbnail.
There is also a bracelet on the wrist that affects the nervous ending in the fingers - also a promised direction.
- Have you tried to cheat your brain?
So he thinks he feels what he seems to feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried it yet.
Here is another challenge to fight for a long time - how to force a person who is physically located in a very distressed area to believe that he is walking in an open, practically infinite space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (not at all like clubs), moving platforms and huge balls.
If the brain fraud becomes a target, it's work for many years.
That's what does work on virtual reality so attractive for researchers - many things are in the full beginning.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is the continuation of the project "Petrogradska avantgarda", dedicated to citizens who are headed, are the adventure of culture and art.
At the top of the list, there have already been significant figures of Petrohrad’s artificial scene, whose extracts exceed the city's framework, often finding recognition in Europe without reaching the universal wave.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the amazing artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is all dressed in the red, you meet here at the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, the fashion houses and the Vernisages.
The pictures of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exposed, always attract the crowds of the audience.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical petrol talkers, creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller - it's an impressive man of the petrograd avantgarda at the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 1990s.
In addition to being a city man, his appearance on the streets causes a smile on the face of the citizens, it increases everyone's mood.
He recently took a bottle in his hand and became a petrogradian bottle, because he grew up to this complex role with his entire Bohemian life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why are you walking around the city all over red and not in yellow or tirky?
- I chose red color as a designer dealing with the image.
In this world, red color is compromise between artist, imagemaker and public.
It is generally true that everything that is just a little different from the grey is abusing aggression and awakening bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at making an interview.
The whole history of my provocational acts is primarily an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- On the exhibition at the Culture House in Nevian, where my work was exhibited.
I understand what my way is.
At that time, the wave of old free non-official artists and the new, free types of artists I couldn't understand.
I've been friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gazonians who led us to Puškin 10, and the other waves weren't.
It makes me feel like a theatre, dressing, music, in all the genres, except for the word.
- And all of this happened in your art clinic ...- It was important to me to find myself in the center of the culture of Peterburg, where all the best creative powers should be gathered.
In 1995, I hired a place on Puškinski 10, and there was a musical and art club, a bohemic club, a home of the peterburg Bogema.
There was a lot of birth: NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how Schnura brought with the "Ucho Van Gogha" project.
Hnur and his friends sang under the sky of light song, dressed up in suitable tricots, among them the composer Igor Vdovin, which is now in fashion.
When the band started playing alive, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was running many Hali-Galivian time programs.
We gave them Trachtenberg, which started his great career, basic education and training from us.
The gallery "D 137", the "Griboyedov" club - it's Art Clinic sound.
This is where our workers and permanent guests left.
I'm the hero of the past century when the culture meant something else.
In 2000 an examination was organized in the press, a special price was "Ljudi in our city".
In the nomination of "The Art of the Year" I was appointed, which ends my top.
In new times, according to old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Nowadays it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristic in a distinguished way.
- Many of my images - these are hits in which the reality and intelligence are caught lively.
I'm going to have a program exhibition of the Russian Museum in clowns.
Clowns are an overtime category.
I used to be social, being like this today is painful and terrible.
But the clowns are erasing everything, and there's a tragic snatch.
I love grotesk, I have grotesk ideas.
For example, save the world by means of a total change in the order of order.
Today, people meet according to their clothes, focus on external mechanics, not on an internal person.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand and you need to spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by change.
- We've seen you as a city bottler recently. - The city of culture should have a hero.
And who should be it if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- Currently, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactical, sweet.
There's a breakdown of cultures.
For once, people were gathering in noises, and God loved one, simple other people.
Today everything broke down on microcommunication, today it's very difficult to like everyone.
I'm not a 100-dollar banknote to like everyone.
Today you need to think who you like.
Today every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And a few thousand viewers will come on Stace Mikhail!
- He'll be found by fans, and there's a sexual social sphere involved.
And 300 people will come on the cultural soil, and 10,000 won't come, and the result is less management, money, everything's cold.
I've got fans, the main thing is, no one's gonna cheat on them and violates what's experienced.
When I was young, I painted pictures that hanged on the wall with Falk and Larion.
I started with pictures that people usually end.
Today people frequently screw up.
They say: Spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There's no consumer culture, that's out of the way.
I'm a man of culture yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejecting money for painting images.
And I'm for such a culture.
- Cyril, what's the lack in Petyerburg?
- Good experts on culture.
There is a concept: a official over the culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
In the days of the proper emperors, it was not in everything, the emperors may not understand the culture too much, but they understood that true experts should be supported.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
With us in Petrohrad, we have people who might be experts, but they are stuck somewhere in the corner, because there are need of great experts who will appreciate these experts correctly and lead them to the right path.
Today the taste is prosperous.
The same Earta, but it's different, since they're honestly saying that we don't accept all modern arts, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think Peterburg is?
- Petierburg - it's not a capital city of culture, there's much more culture in Moscow, there's the right land.
And on our augment, art is prosperous.
We need cultural soil, but we have more writers than readers today, that's wrong.
There are very many people in Europe who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
It's just a weak layer in us.
We need art to become a fashion, as it was at the beginning of the past century.
The project is implemented through the grant of St.Peterburg
Birth in the Universe
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of cosmic ships with landscapes on board are travelling, looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, the main question is: How can we maintain our family in the conditions of no difficulty or on a replacement planet?
I don't think it's a big choice.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be won, even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," said the highly built scientist of the State astronomical Institute P.K. Sternberg (SAIS) Vladimir Surdin.
But while there are better conditions for life on Mars, on the surface of Venus, temperatures of 500 degrees of Celsia are reached.
Living there is only a large height or an orbit of Venus... in the universe.
Solving the questions of reproduction in the universe, scientists started with flora.
Seven centuries ago, plant experiments have been performed.
Four generations of grah grown on the orbit track are nothing different from their earthly relatives.
Then the insect delivery was carried out in the orbit - very small fruit mushrooms of Drosophila.
In 1979, the embryo has been sent to the universe to the egg of crush to check how the embryo develops in the state of gravity.
We get an absolutely normal bird at the exit.
But then trouble starts.
"The problem is that this bird must find resistance, must stand on its own feet and start moving," says the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sičev.
If they don't find resistance, birds fall chaoticly and make cords.
After 10 hours, freshly emptied birds occurred to the total disappearance of instincts.
The birds didn't react to the light or the sound.
And the trouble was that they just died in four days.
"We let the birds out twice, but then we refused, because it's simply impossible to work with them," comments the failure of the chicken experiment in the universe, Vladimir Sičev.
The last "miniarcha" was flying the animals on the orbit road 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, experiments will continue.
In the "Bion" biosatellite, but only the creatures of one gender will be.
There was an experiment with the tissues that were already gravity emitted into the universe.
In fact, there's nothing supernatural.
"It was only on biosatelites, but again - it is a unique experiment and such attempts must be performed," Vladimir Sičev said.
After landing on the ground, a descendant of the cosmic rats was born.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in the universe.
It's a tough task.
Animals in losing the usual environment simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
A man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens controls abstract thoughts and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not performed.
But women fly to the universe for 50 years.
The biggest danger was threatened by Tereshkov.
The most precious thing humanity has is a woman's body.
Our Tea has flyed away and no one on Earth could tell if he could take a flight to the universe.
Is he able to give birth to a child after such a flight?
"Well, no one has answered this question yet," said the veteran of the Vachtang Vachnadze missile-intermediate sector.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight to the universe, the first woman-astronaut Valentina Tereškov daughter was born.
The child’s father was also a cosmonaut Andrian Nikolajev.
In 1988, the son of the second woman-astronaut of Savijska, who visited the orbit twice and also worked in the open universe.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few astronauts who have been born and growing health after years.
"It may also be dangerous in orbital years," says a cosmonaut-pilot, the Hero of the Soviet Union and the Hero of Russia Valerij Poljakov.
Nevertheless, humanity must unavoidably seek new paths in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydrolaborator is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in terms of zero attractivity, the cosmonauts are conquering the habits needed to work in the open universe.
The water is imitating the state of weight.
For adults, water is comfortable but in a strange environment, it is natural for young children.
Little teenagers seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a connection between the child’s average of 9 months in mother’s fruitwater and then it's easier for them to get used to water.
In principle, it's logical, because since the moment of birth, since the first bath, only two weeks will last.
"That's very little to forget a child," says Marina Axenov's instructor for swimming.
Shortly speaking - if the newborn child's condition is more natural, then natural gravity is more natural for women, attractive force.
In the state of gravity, it happens very quickly to abdominal muscles, muscles of the panve, declines the ability of the body to push the fetus.
We can leave this aside if the muscle stimulators are working at birth.
Eventually, it is possible that birth takes place in a special chamber where the mother's organism will produce the fetus.
"And what?" Valerius Poljakov asks the complex questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the organism is not affected by the earthly attraction, it cannot form the muscle or the muscle system properly.
Newborns on the orbit track cannot be dressed as an adult in a special suit with a burden in which he could train.
He'll just be rid of what he needs for his development.
"If we go with you to an experiment that allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring a healthly infected person to the Earth who will be completely inappropriate to the environment," predicts the IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.
So the diversion of children in the universe today is just a theoretical question.
However, one day, the time will become reality and the earthly ones will go to their ships on a far planet that will become the home of their descendants born in the universe.
Boss of NKU: Control of the Schwarcsist failed by politicians
In relation to the public contracts of a good controller and the quality legislation, Czech Republic is screwing up in its application.
In an interview for Currently.ch says the Vice-President of the High Control Office of Miloslav Kala.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that is what I think we miss," Kala comments.
Similar conclusions also indicate the common control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of the wrong practice, Peter's approach to the so-called "shwarcsystem".
Mr. Prime Minister recently said that the OPS would not bother the businessman with his controls - is he therefore prohibited or authorised?
"The law must be set up somehow, and if it prohibits anything, the government's president cannot stop the activity of the office which is required to go to control and pursue obligations," Kala states.
At the meeting of the Monitoring Committee in the Assembly, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and the German Party, which compared legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What was it specifically?
It's a parallel control we launched about two years ago.
Simplifiedly, it is said that the European legislation adjusts how to deal with public contracts, followed by individual national legislation and then the practice itself.
We have put all this together, and even though the control has not been completed yet, we have shown very interesting differences - generally, the legislation is even more strict and perfect, but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to devote itself to the application of the law.
What can this project do for you?
Such a joint control could help us to stop making efforts to analyze laws, reduce and improve the limits when it does not have such a positive impact.
The economy means acquiring an appropriate thing for a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price to exclude enrichment and criminal proceedings.
But by reducing the procurement limit, we don't have to make it necessary.
Maybe the system will absorb the amount of "paper" that those who want to look for holes in this system will be much easier to draw from it than if the limit remains higher.
You're talking about local problems with the transfer of legislation on public procurement to practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is the office similar to our NKB, or is it set differently?
As for the authorities, as well as the NKU works there, Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized as we are, he also has a colleague, just forms a little different way, but in principle both authorities are acting similarly.
Also, the powers are to a certain extent similar, however, by the fact that Germany has a common arrangement, so these accounting courts also have at the level of individual communities - that makes the system a little different from ours.
The BRH can only control the cooperative money, represented by our state resources.
The public centres that are managed in our areas and communities are checked from the level of the general accounting courts.
What about the laws there, is it easier than ours?
Generally, I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some respects Germany is designed as a model, but it is certainly not possible to say that it is better in everything.
So does this need to be because they have better controllers?
No, of course not, but I'm saying again, I don't like that comparison.
But it is important to say that the countries that we consider models are faced with a number of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be a benefit for them to cooperate with our office, would it?
What about the local legislation, which your office meant a novel of the Public Procurement Act, has any effect on it?
Since the period of validity of this novel is relatively short, it is not yet in our control actions.
Because we're doing ex post checks, we need to count on a certain delay.
We are watching this only in the process of preparing future controls - we launched our new instrument "detecting risks of irregularity", through which we have prosecuted almost 14,000 public orders, and we analysed them - there, of course, these changes will be manifested, because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of election procedure will be adjusted and similarly.
So do you consider the approval of this law rather a benefit, or another burden of the burden of the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that can happen here is that she's going to "scarce" and it's not going to be able to follow it.
For the functioning of previous rules, the controlled persons are committed by the provider (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to ensure that any non-compliance of the public contracts law means violation of the budgetary discipline.
So is the law worth making it stronger in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse him, not punish those who make formal doubts that do not affect decisions.
Such a system will only create greater pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do you get out of this?
Let's see where the road doesn't lead.
Recently, Mr. Prime Minister said that ODS would not bother the entrepreneur by controlling the so-called "shwarcsystem" - and what does that mean?
Is the Schwarcsystem forbidden or permitted?
The law must, however, be set in some way, and if it prohibits anything, the government's chairman can not prevent the activity of the office which is required to go to control and pursue responsibilities.
He can say, "We'll change the law and allow it," but he can't say we're doing nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, relatively strict rules are to be formally implemented - which is right to protect the public competition.
But on the other hand, it's tragic when the best dealer is excluded for formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that's what we think is missing.
Roads are freezing, but mostly downstairs.
In several places of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowy.
But mostly, the tickets are swimming, somewhere with increased caution.
Karlovar County
In the Karlovar County, the roads were swimming this morning, but the places were frozen and snowy.
Temperature fell between five and ten degrees below zero, but during the day it should be slightly warm.
The snowing in the region has stopped and only weak layers are at the bottom.
However, there is about 30 cm snow on the hills of the Mountains.
Places were also lower visibility due to the fog, resulting from the dispatch of district passengers.
Speedway R6 and first-class communications are now unlimited in the region.
However, caution is in place, for example, in some restraints where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
All roads of the second and third class, including mountain roads, are also departured.
But in some parts, there are still the rest of the ice cream and the places of snow.
In particular, in higher positions, more attention should be paid to the ride.
Pardubic and the King's Garden
Some roads in the eastern Czech are threatened by frozenness, in higher positions and in the mountains, there may be a snow layer in communications, he informs on his pages The Management of roads and roads.
Road drivers warn the drivers from frozenness, especially in the higher locations of the Pardubian region.
The event may be in the area of Lanshcroun, the Easter of Orlic, Police, Switav or the High Myth, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 at Switav.
The snow is particularly on roads in the Krkonoshes and the Orlic Mountains.
The captured snow layer is in the highest positions of roads in the Rychnov districts above the Priest and Trutnov.
In the eastern Czech Republic, today the most commonly is clear to half-distance without collisions.
Temperatures are usually moving between minus three and plus one degree of Celsia, smoking a weak wind.
Plazina region
The roads in the Plzanian district are tossed this morning, places, but with increased caution and ride, weather needs to be adjusted.
It's freezing in the morning, temperatures move between three to nine degrees under the ice point.
After preceding snow and subsequent cooling, some communications may be frozen.
The places of the driver must count even with fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
It comes from information to the district roadman's dispatch.
The D5 distance is nearly unlimited, but more caution is recommended by the communication managers between 80 and 131 miles.
Most first-class roads have a surface dry and frozen.
But there may be freezing segments in the Southern Plzenia and Tachovia.
The communications of the second and third class are wet and in this case also apply to the frozen sections.
The drivers should be cautious mainly on less frequent roads in the area of Šumawa.
Olomouch region
With the snow coughs on the road, drivers are going to the highest places of the Olomouck district today.
After the chemical syringe, she stayed on the Red Gore seat and on her way to the Village Cross.
Travelers were expelled to the ground at night of snow, in Schumper, according to road managers, they snowed about three centimeters.
In other parts of the area, the cartridges are mostly unlimited.
"The rest of the snow is lying in the highest positions of Schumper.
With snow coughs on the Red Gore seat, drivers must count in the direction of the autumn," said today the CTK disseminator of the road management.
At night, their colleagues went to Yesenique, and the highest locations are now according to them, after chemical treatment, naked and wet.
In Olomouck the roads are without limitations, however, drivers should be careful in the forest sections where the vehicles remain wet.
District, Liberian District
Now a few difficult seats are reported after the roadman in the northern Czech.
Besides several places with an attacked snow or an ice cream, a mountain road from Telnica to Kninice at Usteck is also closed, it comes from the police database.
Temperatures are also maintained in lower positions below zero, so ice and snow are likely to endure on the roads.In the lowers, especially south-east of the Czech Mediterranean, there are no problems, and the roads are usually dry.
Operational complications are not yet reported.
The phenomenon of the ice cream reports the roadmakers in particular from the area of Štécia.
According to meteorologists, at night, the ideal conditions -- over the day of rain and snowing, the night was clear and freezing.
The main moves also report the adverse conditions on the road I/13 on the borders of the Austical and Liberian District.
The closure from Telnica to Kninice forced the branches of trees that snowed up to the cart.
Simon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy on concerts
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other warnings that we people like to catch.
Together with the Tap Tap band, we're rather joking about it, saying that we're the only band in the world who can gather enough positive energy to remove or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you will organize a totally unique project three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to the readers closer?
It's a whole state beneficial action that we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of Mayan calendar announced on 21 December at 11:10 p.m.
The day before 20 December from 21 hours, 3 concerts in Prague, Brna and Ostrava will be performed simultaneously.
They will end nearly at the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the time zone 12 hours before us.
Who came with this idea?
It was probably my idea, and then we made things up with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to the acquisition of sufficient positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state in which this world will once be transferred to our children.
At the time of the end of the Mayan calendar, we also created a unique collection of shoes, shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world whose purchase on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other interpretations, also sang the so-called hymna against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World Abolished".
She's very popular today on YouTube, will she also sound at these beneficial concerts?
Of course, in a complete conclusion, so if we all do, and the end of the world doesn't happen...
All the interpretations on all three concerts consistently sing it.
Hymny is also connected to a unique direct transfer to Czech TV.
He wrote the words to this song and the main role of Jesus in the video plays Tomasz Hanaak, also singing in it Xindl X...
How did you get to cooperate with them?
We also cooperate with other characteristics of the Czech cultural scene, since we do a lot of beneficial actions and concerts...
We're trying to engage them in these projects intensely.
It turns out that most of them are interested in working with us and talking.
What's going to do with the excursion from the concerts against the end of the world?
For the equipment of a non-barrier educational centre Studeo, which we have implemented for the sixth year with the Tap Civil Association in the Jedlic Constitution.
The school students of the Eedlick Constitution regularly end up with lecturers and devoted themselves to activities that they enjoy and interest.
The students themselves do not have the means to turn themselves into lecturers, so we're trying to allow them this way.
A separate building will be created in the future as part of the Eedlich's Constitution, which we move with this project.
There are several musical groups and interpreters on each concert.
What did you pick them by?
We tried to build a program that would address all generations, including children.
For example, China, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiří Suchy will be presented in Prague.
See www.kpx.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombasic acts" to the future?
In May, we're going to be on Prague spring for the first time, so we're sure to prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
In the next year, we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we are in the U.S., I would like to connect this with the show in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimal, for example, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by disabilities.
How do you manage these ways logistically and organicly?
It's not as terrible as it seems at first.
We have five members on the electric wheelchair, her wheelchairs must travel in the trunk space, and, of course, we drag a large amount of cargo and a bedroom with tools...
Nevertheless, by the time, this has always worked without problems, the CHSA and British Airways were greatly prepared for me to be surprised as many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was no problem.
You can compare travels to abroad how individuals differ in barrierness, public access to disabilities and similar things.
What have you met yet?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places where everything works better than ours, we were just witnessed in Russia that the east is still in full beginnings.
In addition to Prague, Moscow is very barrier, here is still unusual that a person on the electric wheelchair himself moves in the center of the city.
It does not even apply for certainty, such as you may prefer the carriers in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are civil associations that try to alert people with disabilities.
And what do we still need to reach more advanced lands?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
But it is important to mention that improvement and improvement are always dependent on the efforts of people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is entirely common that people with severe handicap are moving separately in the public, they can go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere...
But it is not too common that a large number of people with disabilities would actively participate in the social life there, in contrast, we are with The Tap Tap a little ahead!
Respecting public or barrier is one thing, but only the moment we're going to be important sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, so things start to change.
So far, these are unique cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap band is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years ago, what made you build it in 1998?
I joined as a raiser in the Eedlic’s Constitution, where I had many young people around me who were interested in something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I'm playing saxophone, so I started an interesting musical circle with my colleague.
Well, in the course of time, what our moderator Lađa Angelovic says is a little out of our hand.
But the popularity has arrived in the past few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it has helped us when we began to connect with known singers and work actively on the promotion of the band.
We realized that the job that didn't see was basically as if it wasn't.
In addition, through contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality lectures, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to get it with The Tap Tap this high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Showbusiness is filled with things where one imitates the other.
It's logical in a way, all news are taken carefully and it takes a long time.
Things that's unique are very little, but I'm just trying to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, pity, it's natural...
But that regret is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all the abandoned creatures that we must regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I'm telling you, if something happens to people with a handicap, it's not just a move for them, it's for the whole company.
Did this success also help you to be a strict boss, how many people mark you?
If we want to do quality work, we must be unpromised in many matters and require a certain discipline.
But that's totally normal.
Some people come to us with romantic ideas and heads in clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to a test twice a week, go to the preparation and spend a lot of time on the journeys on the concerts, they will be abandoned quickly.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group who wants to work and who wants to achieve something.
The Tap Tap band currently has twenty members.
How many of them were at her start in 1998?
Only Lydia Angelovich.
We're an open group, people leave and come, that's impossible to stop.
Whoever has the will and the taste, has always opened doors
The day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 hours
It will take place in Prague Incheba arena, Brne Fléda and Ostrava Plynoya for the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities will be connected by telemost at the joint singing of the band The Tap Tap "The end of the world is cancelled"
The goal of the concert is to gather funds for the equipment of a multi-functional STUDEO facility at the Eedličko Constitution in Prague in volume of 25 million Kč
The concert is 400 Kč, children up to 12 years of age have a free ticket in the Bohemiaticket pre-sale
Poland and space.
Last week, the Ministers of the European Space Agency adopted Poland as the twentieth member of this European space agency, as the second country from the former eastern bloc countries (from Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland launched close cooperation with the ESA in 1994, and during the next years it participated in a number of projects of the Agency.
Of course, Poland's way to cosmos began much earlier.
For years, Polish enthusiasts were committed to space before World War II; but they did not always meet understanding.
For example, I will remind A. Sternfeld's lecture in Warsaw's astronomical observatory, which represented the ideas of his pioneer work Introduction to cosmonautics on December 6, 1933.
The thoughts of a young engineer (natural 1905) left the listeners cold and after years, Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won the price of Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for entering a cosmonautic in France.
The memorial Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promotor of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a worldly famous promotor of cosmonautics, and his benefit was also appreciated by the name of one of the crockers on the distracted side of the Moon.
In 1925, a railway drezina was built in Poland, which was to be handled by a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and no details of the project are known.
It is not even clear whether the missile was to be used to break or brake it.
The information on this drezina is known only by the daily press.
Since 1933, rocket shots have started to engage the Polish artillery.
The research was provided by the Arms Technical Cell in cooperation with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfk and Professor Gustav Mokřickiegi.
From stored materials, it is obvious that research has reached a stage of practical tests.
However, research was discontinued by the arrival of German troops.
In 1937, a photo-electric missiles designed by Rogozinsky engineer appeared in the professional press, and in the next year the work of the Raketa Air Torpedo and the missilebomb of the aircraft author Leli-Krivoblok.
Both projects were designed for military use of missile engines.
Just before the war, all projects of military use of missile techniques were devoted to the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (The Temporary Advisory-Scientific Committee), which he coordinated.
The Committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of action, its activities ceased the start of war.
Other work dedicated to astronautics after a war in Polish press appears through the work of the Polish astronautical society (Poland Astronautical Society).
For the first time, the company is mentioned in the November edition of the 1954 magazine Problems, in which four larger articles are dedicated to astronautics.
In one of them, from Professor M. Subotawich, it is designed to create a company that will deal with a cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial partner projects were already underway and it was clear that space research was a perspective area.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish astronautical company (PTA) has tried to enter the International Astronautical Federation (based on 1951) and has already become a proper member on the autumn.
And in the next year, the first PTA President Kazimer Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became Vice-President of the International Astronautical Federation.
This function was held until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has significantly participated in the development of a very successful meteorological missile RM (Meteorological missile), which has become the first Polish missile to conduct scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch was 10 October 1958.
The rocket with access to 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of RM-1A was built and in the summer of 1959 the flight tests of RM-2 were launched in the Bledov Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and its weight was approximately 11.5 kg.
Another development type was already to be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 missile should have access to up to 14,5 km and its task was to monitor the wind.
However, further development was suspended in 1962.
The follower of the first RM rockets became a Meteor-1 missile developed in 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was concentrated as two degrees, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which were different from the size of space for scientific devices.
The Meteor-1A missile was available with a volume of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C with a volume of 0.62 litres.
Maximum access to all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Air Force of Meteor-2, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket was a 380 kg launch weight and was able to deliver a useful load of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were then built.
The entry of Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) must be mentioned in 1960 and the establishment of a COSPAR national committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research in Soviet art partners, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermashewski became the second intersmonaute after Vladimir Remk.
Abolition of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
The resolution has raised a live discussion in the public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the problem from a wider perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on more, unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic offices, national economic systems, stand in a permanent conflict between themselves.
The principle of free trade and free, unlimited movement of private capital, along with unreliable financial speculation, is caused.
In the light of the significant differences in the labour price, the price tension is at stake.
Under this point, it is necessary to understand the situation where the manufacturer is trying to survive by importing cheap goods by "increasing" the price of the competitor in order to retrieve a larger market share and thus increase its own profits.
In mass terms, this means either to translate production into a foreign country, or to shopping cheaply, or to disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are compared to other high economies.
Because the private capital has no social responsibility and thus the responsibility for its produced unemployment, the State’s social expenditure are necessarily growing.
The whole situation strengthens the full independence of business masters to pay taxes and thus replace the economic and social injury that he has committed in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so generally known that specific statistics are not required.
The unreasonable practices of private capital create in individual economies the situation where governments of individual countries are forced to enter mutual competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments give their own population to private capital, regardless of the social failure.
This is mainly manifested in the amendments of the laws applicable.
The aim of economically to force its own population to adopt a Private Capital Privacy Dictate, in particular in the area of remuneration.
However, this is a system of economic forces in case of long-term unemployment, but by limiting the rights of employees in the field of employment law.
The result is the growing poverty, along with the growing differences between the poor and the rich.
In the SRN, there have been a number of years of public food production for poor people who cannot be used by their own work.
The number of these people is already in millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is generally common to cases that properly employed people receive such remuneration that they must be paid to the existing minimum.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of helpful workers of the SGE.
The savings of practically all Southern EU countries are ultimately leading to the same situation where people under the pressure of a disaster social failure are forced either to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to live for hungry wages on the edge of the company, hoping that someday a private investment capital will come into the country.
But where does it come from?
If it is from other countries of the EU, poverty is moved from one country to another or does not come at all, because Chinese, India, Brazilian, or Turk, or Moroccan, or Egyptian, or Africa are still working for a fraction of European remuneration.
It's all about Latin America.
Liberal theory and media claim that it cannot be a capital participating in its own economy that the governed economy leads to economic disaster.
The private capital urges the opinion that the State must not interfere with the controlling impacts in the economy.
Then we need to ask if the private capital affects, in fact, it is now the policy management and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here's a clear answer that it is.
The evidence of existence is practically almighty and in all countries everywhere present lobby.
The result is the desperate situation in the area of corruption, the provision of mutual benefits, the law where practically everything is criminal but nothing criminal.
In the SRN, the state ministries for the lack of financial funds give the drafting of laws to private legal companies, which are dense in relation to industry.
These proposals of the laws are subsequently consented in Bundestag.
All powers are not like this from the people, as the West-type Constitutions report, but from financially strong groups prefering their own interests.
It is clear that liberally oriented democracies are now getting into the situation as Appianos described in its work of the Crisis of the Roman Republic at Caesar and Pompei: "The State has been in full divorce for a long time, and the authorities have been engaged in violence.
For bribes, illicit acquisition of grace, and using stones or swords.
The subpayment and corruption were built without any barriers and the people went to elections with the advanced vote" ... "the characteristics of people did not go to the office at all, so once he was the result of this divorce was standing for eight months without consulates.""The only drug in the evil situation was self-control and that it was necessary to choose an energy man." Appiaanos thought of Pompei, but became the Caesar, who changed for the last democracy to self-control.
The conclusion is based on an unreasonable preference for its own benefit, regardless of the overall social interest.
The private capital is no longer capable of understanding and applying the Community benefits.
The result is now, like then, an inappropriate Decade to elite without any effort to reform a deeper rise.
The cause of fascist and communist regimes, therefore, we must look for the unreasonable liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th century.
For the current state, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of Liberal Democracy may be considered a certain break with the expectation of another circle.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that current elites completely ignore possible hundreds of thousands of lives, humanitarian and social disasters that we have already witnessed with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
Abolition of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of competition, both at international and internal levels, the Czech Republic's government will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of population.
This trend is therefore systematic.
The solutions are targeted political and social reforms to strengthen the capital participation of the State in the economy, strengthen the impact of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of chaos.
"Nothing will come from violence and never can" Sting in Fragile's song, whose main verse in the refren is "Let's forget how creepy we are"
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be any" Gutelle Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and Gaza’s zone, as always, a lot of reactions have occurred.
One stands behind Israel, arguments his right to self-defense, and Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, argument racism by the Israeli state, genocide derived from Palestinian Arabs and the state of Israel fit into the role of the terrorist state.
I don't want to think about who is in the periodically repeated waves of killing the guilty and who is the victim, eventually today's inhabitants of Israel, including self-regular territories, born into the present political situation and the beginning of violence, have not experienced.
I'm about to offer the readers a view of the tyre, the view of whom it serves mostly for 95 years of continuing tension ( counted by Balfour's Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of the Middle East country.
Some of my considerations are supported by the availability of historical facts, some of them are carried out on the basis of my own understanding of who resp. which group of people is the main movement of events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first the history of the fight of power.
We can see some of that Alexandr Big or Napoleon at every time.
What is not so obvious is that they were always those individuals who were completely autonomously steering their steps and or whether someone who directed their actions to the advanced goal was behind their throne.
We must admit that we live in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and the power of them could not come to life for a generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families, there is one that could be considered the head of the octopus (if anyone else stands above them, but I do not exclude it) - Rothschields.
It's not much about them.
Understood.
The first press agency (Reuters) was purchased in the 1990s to stop the connection of their name with highly criminal acts in which they standed in the background and which always meant to them the reinforcement of power, multiplication of wealth or both.
They have main shares in nearly all central banks of the world and against countries where shares in the central bank do not lead or prepare wars (that was 7 countries before the attack of Afghanistan, it was 5 countries after Iraq was attacked, but only four remained, but Russia was subject to the central bank of the Russian government).
Whoever tried to object to this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Central Bank of Rothschield Bank of America, began to issue his own (conscious government) money and was murdered in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began spending his own money and wanted to cancel the FED, was murdered in 1963, and Ambassador Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for a major economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of the plan of three world wars by the highest wall, the 33th degree of dedication by Albert Pick.
The first war was to remove the large monarchistic nationals in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial domination in particular of Great Britain, and the third has to lead to a reduction of the world population somewhere to 0.5 - 1 billion people (this number of slaves for their comfort and luxury is sufficient and they do not need so many resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a prerequisite for such a solution) and the final capabilities.
The method that the richest family group leads with Rothschieldy is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab chao - order of chaos).
However, these solutions are fake and are always leading to worsening the situation (see the FED foundation so that the crisis is not repeated as the one they caused in 1907).
So after they managed to kill the Habsbourg throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Imperial Russia by launching a Bolshevic Revolution.
The first World War ended by suddenly, military and economically unfounded, Germany's капitulation (not needed for the destruction of the Imperial Russia) and then broken the Central European Power, Austria Ureska.
In order to facilitate the second World War, the political bankers had allowed the political bankers to create a latently conflicting situation by putting a huge war reparation on Germany, creating a prediction of radicalization of the poor mass, and then they had to only embark on the Germans enough strong, guilty and easy solution to the Leader offering and further creating a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority that was to play, and also played, the function of the fifth colony, in the launch of a warfire.
In the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield foundation of the Sionist Movement, whose one branch was striving to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as a capital city (return to the Sion).
The already mentioned Balfour Declaration created an assumption for the mass immigration of the Jews to Palestine, began to occur first conflicts with the local Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The second World War has exploded if Hitler has ripped out of the chain where international bankers held it or all he has done was hard to estimate, however, the suffering of European Jews in concentrations created an assumption for the adoption of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and as the war reparations of Germany were made at World II, a third warfire was made by the State of Israel.
If the international bankers succeed, the Jewish nation, as in the second, will be victims in the first line of battle, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of quarrel and chaos not only within the country but also internationally. (Let's just consider how sharp people are divided into the favors and opponents of Israel.)
Who is the guilty, and who is the victim in the Palestinian - Israeli conflict, where the wrongdoing produces violence in the endless chain of violence, when the greedyness of individuals and their desire for global power at the beginning of all?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers emphasize people's choice in elections exclusively their own candidates.
The contemporary prime minister of Israel, Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, to international bankers of loyalty, politics, which is doing everything to stretch the war with Iran, which, in view of the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would have threatened to increase in the global conflict and in view of Iran's control over the Hormus Stream, which travels 20% of all world oils (the sailing corridor is only 2 miles wide) and to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light the words David Rockefeller said in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world regulation in their imagination is the world of gentlemen and slaves.
The world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a bunch of financial aristocracy.
The world where each newborn individual is implanted at the birth of a chip that makes it a totally controlled creature.
"And he forces all the small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves to have on their right hand or on the head of the seats, so that he cannot buy or sell, who is not marked by the name of that beast or the number of its name.
That must be understood: who is reasonable to collect the numbers of the beast.
This number marks a human and it's a number sixty-six."
Film Argo: When the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, he enrolled a crowd of demonstrating Islamic students in the American Embassy in Teheran and captured 52 diplomats as hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for the shock of Mohamed Réz Pahlavi, who fled to the United States after the revolution, which had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the American administration, it was not a positive way out - to throw a shock over the board, because it would be essentially threatening trust in allies in other countries.
However, the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution was established in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was unable to achieve.
It was a wound for the prestige of the United States, which was later deepened by the fiasco of attempting to release the hostage by force.
The diplomatic prisons were finally released after 444 days after the negotiations were mediated by the Algerian government.
Their share at home caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
Debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the loss of Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan in presidential elections 1980.
The film of the directing actress Ben Affleck Argo describes an episode of the history that brought America a tiny victory.
Six employees fled from her just before the Embassy.
After complicated perceptions, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran, helping an extravagant cover of the story - they went to the Canadian passports as members of the movie headquarters who looked at the locations in the country for the sci-fi film.
Genre Combination
The plan that an expert designed for "exfiltrating" Tony Mendez also required Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to be true, the film project was written in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, the fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation have been secreted for a long time, the movie comes from Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a special combination of more genres.
On one side of the realistic political thriller, the same as the "caper movie", the story of an illustrated piece, the example can be Danny's series of partners.
In the film, the moods are allocated - on one side of the documentary sequence from Teheran (the title sequence shows iconic era photos of events and the way the same situation was shown in the film - there are no big differences in it).
On the other hand, the free passage from Hollywood, reconciled with irony and mild excess.
And then scenes from the ClA and other institutions - men in suits are discussing the situation at the tables, in the office halls, in the phone...
Ben Afflek was able to restart his career in a remarkable way.
From a ridiculous actress he became a respected director, and his activities also ceased to be the target of ironic notes.
Argo is his third night film, after the dark crimes of Gone Baby Gone (2007) and thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it's the first picture of Affleck that doesn't happen in the director's home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was among the characteristics that the senior movies of the director expanded above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in Arg, where Teheran plays Canada.
The best scenes in the film are happening in the streets, when reconstructing real events - the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its transparency, which also means emotions of confusion and insight that occur when somewhere clear history moves.
Similar effects Affleck and his colleagues are achieved in the stages of the designed (fake headquarters on the theeran base).
Too many stories in too many places
The director must have dealt with the fact that the story is not really much in the film sense of the stressful scenes.
It's pretty successful with this, sometimes it thinks of reality - it's not all so elegantly out there (the scene in which the threatening crisis at the Teeran Airport will reverse the call in America and the railway race acts quite attracted to the hair).
The weakness of Arga is, however, the disturbance resulting from the need to show too many stories in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood’s colleagues, but their figures would deserve more space and are not the only ones in the movie.
Affleck's film is kind of losing a dramatic move, which is a picture that can be watched with a mild interest, to evaluate the realization of the retro style evolving thrillery in the 70s.
But it's just tough to rip it off.
As a reminder to a certain way of living history and the evidence of how exaggerated are the imaginations of the almighty and universal secret services, but will be sufficient.
Rules for balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovni charges.com, which annually declares a survey of the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd regulations or ideas from the EU workshop".
"The last event that the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the management of large European companies has led us to this," said the Law organizer of the poll of Patrick Nacher.
For example, among the nominated absurds, there is a recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the unification of the insurance rates for men and women.
However, women at life insurance prices have been benefited because they are objectively less risky for insurance.
"The further unbelievable ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place by the end of February 2013," Nacher informed.
Among the controversial regulations of the EU, it is necessary to mix biocommodation into engine materials, which resulting from nature's damage, the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury temperatures only because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances or a Directive on the size of the chicken cages that have significantly betrayed the eggs this year.
Critics had also faced the actual prohibition of the use of the expression of anointed butter or the elimination of classical lamps from sales.
Quality bananas have 14 inches
The Union apparatus often decides under the pressure of that or that commercial or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels are usually protected by a State or group of States (e.g. Czech Republic now and the threat of veta is promoting the requirements of its banks).
The interests of the lobby were also that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to reach at least 14 cm in the Union and should not show "anomal curve".
The European Commission, however, defended itself by harmonizing so far ununit national standards that complicated trade.
The EU's fruit and vegetable standards have already softened through some countries' resistance that existing directives lead to food waste.
The candidate for the victory in the survey may also be the EU Regulation last year, according to which the selling balloons must be obliged to notify that children under 8 years of age must not be pushed without adult supervision.
The EU has responded here to an American research which suggests that balloons among toys are the cause of the death of children to choke.
Similar limitations are now applicable to children under 14 years of age when blowing into packaging pumps.
Curious ideas are born at home
Relatively absurd, then, is the rule on European officials themselves - anyone who has an official function in the EU, cannot use the topic sensitivity for Greece and must speak instead of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association of liberal economies, Laissez Faire has nominated the bank charges.com to a survey, in addition to some of the above, may be absurd by the EU Regulation on the volume of food supplies in the territory of the Member State.
The EU has established the maximum volumes of food supplies that could be located on the territory of the PRC on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, certain volumes in preserved mushrooms, which threatened him with a high penalty.
The survey organizers also took the idea of paying to some countries for the lack of sea, and the idea of granting funds on the request for grants.
However, these ideas were not in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are hampered by no sea.
We will ask the European Union for reimbursement," said the Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (CSSD) on autumn 2004.
As a argument, he stated that many grains were born in our homes, and as a result of so-called intervention shopping, he had to stand in full stocks that he had to export.
For the continuation of Czech Republic to the ports, the EU had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros according to the Palace.
The European Commission eventually arrived from the CRC by organizing a tend to buy grain from lands that have no access to the sea.
The grants for acquisition were offered to the local Ministry of Local Development, managed by Minister Paul Germany (U.S.D.), specifically, to be written to the grant request from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre Regulations are an exception
While the Regulation in the Member States is easily aimed at criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and at the same time more effective functioning and the development of the entire Union, according to a number of experts, deserve more recognition.
The more serious problem is, for example, the EU grants to projects that have no indication of anything involving the promotion of European integration, but which have been forced by the Member States during the budgeting negotiations.
The emotion between the Czech Republic also encourages the fact that, as well as other Union countries, the CRC in Brussels must fight for the right to specific labelling of its traditional products, not always succeeding in this fight.
Although the Czechs, after the six-year fight against the Germans and the Rakusians, avoided the marking of olomous shapes, but the rum in the country, whose tradition touches us by the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename a landlord.
The names of rums can only be carried out from fertile distillate, not of sugar beans.
In the official list of EU registered products, the world-known feta and gorgonzole, the German Lübeck marcipan or the parm chunks have already experienced, for example, carlovar sugars, mountainal and trebonian capr and cereal chmel.
The EU's protective mark can also be proud of the pardubic pipe and the mountain tubes.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm amateur, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man think he wants to run for a president?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If it worked without trouble in our country, I'd be nowhere.
But I can't watch the last twenty years of the country steal, the thieves running, the taxes, and the age of retirement.
I shouldn't have been an ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, I'm trying to figure out how to change it.
And since I was 40 years old and I'm an independent non-party, I have no other way to influence things than to run for a senator or president.
You've reached the Senate, but you've gone to the castle.
Don't you turn your back to the people who chose you?
All the time I said I'd go to the castle fight according to the results of the Senate elections.
Later, I said that if I'm elected a senator, I'm going to run for the president.
But my goal is not a function, the function is a tool to perform my visions.
That's why I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate.
But the trouble is not just that we give as a nation in the cafeteria and on television, but that we're going to smash anyone who wants to try to change.
This includes media that dehonest humans and confusing freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
I might have been claimed to pay for a journalist or I was the advisor of George Parroubk.
Let's go to your visions.
In the fight for the castle, you have gone with this material and criminal responsibility of politicians and returned property confessions over 20 million.
You have to change the law for that.
But as president, you don't have such authority, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to deal with it?
When I lobbed as a citizen to make the leadership free, it was able to make it clear.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good proposal on the left or on the right, the adherence will reject, and it delays citizens.
As an independent non-party, I have a much greater potential to get support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without a party bounce and dogma, I can take something that is best for our country, on every side and apply it.
Do you think you're a man of the right or the left?
From the Czech perspective, I feel like people are getting me more left.
It doesn't matter to me if it's a little left or a little right.
It's important for me to move forward.
I don't care if anyone belongs to the left or right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any publicly good solution, even if it is proposed by KSCHM or ODS, and I will also be against the wrong thought.
You're kidding me when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you make a business in the company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And that's what you're trying to get closer to.
Someone may call it Populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world, or important experts talked about.
But without parliamentary support, only passwords will be left.
And that's not enough in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you can make a criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Convince politics, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to make it aside.
If I have been elected by the President, there is no problem in organizing a direct television transfer where I will ask the President of the parliamentary parties to legalize the material and criminal responsibility for politics, officials, judges and state representatives.
And they'd have to tell why they didn't want her.
If a strong personality that names scary, it can be pushed on the political scene.
Take the president's direct choice, that was a public pressure.
I'm just saying I'm an amateur that I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
For my views and visions, I'm trying to find allies.
I just started in politics, and for my program, I'm trying to get most support.
I'm trying to move things on my own, if it's not gonna work, I'm going to finish in six years and return to the private sector.
Sounds like Okamura should save Czech Republic.
I'm no rescue.
I know I'm not going to do anything in one person, so I've been circling a number of famous people, whether they can't either go to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Janchuro, and he refused for the quantity of work.
So at least I supported an investigative journalist, Jana Lorenz, who covered the fraud with light heat oils.
I candided with people being really unsatisfactory, but now I'm on weight.
Sixty percent of people weren't the elections, and those who went have chosen mostly representatives of the establishment.
We're just two independent in the Senate.
People have elected the Senate so that changes will be made difficult.
Still, I will fight for my visions, for example, for the direct choice of mayors or heitmans.
Are you considering the establishment of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the pure past of every potential party, and I don't even have money for it.
I don't have any money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20 grand on my transparency account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property confessions, what's yours?
I'm guessing my private property is about 60 million.
In Prague, I have an estate for about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of artwork for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Superb damage for a million, and then a couple of millions on the account.
By the way, Aston Martin, I have because it was my boyfriend's dream - I always liked James Bond, who was riding in the car, galantic to women, and at the same time fighting against badness and badness.
You ride Aston Martin, you have a property for 60 million, and you don't have any money for a campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not too convincing.
I don't have 15 million for a campaign.
Should I owe it?
I've hit the campaign already 2.5 million.
The fact that I don't have any sponsorships is evidence that my program probably isn't that interesting.
And I don't have a duty to pay for campaigns from my own.
The cost of the campaign will essentially cover what the senator's pay is.
But I wouldn't have lived from it, for example, I couldn't pay my son an English school, which is worth 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't go anywhere.
So you're going to keep business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd suppress these activities?
But it doesn't relate to the highest salary.
As I promised, I partially strangled my activities.
For example, the traveler will become my representative on spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who will save the Republic.
But I need to live from something too.
How much have you been used to taking a month as an entrepreneur?
Two hundred to 400 grand, which I'm going on.
And if I were a president, I'd end my business.
The whole conversation will be found in the Saturday edition of the Law.
The MVRDV architects are evidence that real adventure is not only in the head - for example Spikkenissa and recently built Mountain of Books - 2 photos
"This building seems fun to me, it looks futuristic, and finally it's again to see something interesting," says Lisette Verhaig, walking around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technique in the nearby large business, thinks, "Of course, this house is nice."
But I ask what else we need today?
Everyone has Internet, iPads and electronic books.
None of these libraries in old styles are voluntary now, are they?
Spickenisse, a seat close to Rotterdam without its own job opportunities that are not even worth visiting, holds a special record.
This community with 80 000 inhabitants shows the lowest level of education throughout the Netherlands.
In order to solve this stupid situation, a few years ago, the decision to contribute to universal education and to build seven beautifully painted iron-beton miniatures of fictile bridges, which are displayed on euro banknotes.
But the success of the educational offensive was not disgusting.
So the city councils have learned that there is only one way to become master statistics: we need a library!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architectural athlete MVRDV, master of insanely courageous column graphs and a funny, often even cynical buildings, accepted the matter with ordinary calm and at a competitive meeting in 2003, appeared with five books under his arms and a scratch on his face.
And while the committee was still impressed by looking around and screaming his shoulders, the nasty Maas made his gifts on his own size, and his actively justified speech ended with the words "Dear City Municipality!"
So this is my proposal to the Mountain Book in Spickeniss, so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, a mountain of 30 million euros was completed.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also belongs to underground parking, supermarket, mail and several suitable housing and series homes with 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Mountain of Books was appointed by the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
Furthermore, the project is nominated at the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
A small town grey, which has not yet been able to offer more than a post-modern walk of the zone and an unusual ugly council whose white fasada you would rather expect a milk store, is richer than a little judicial architecture.
But above all, Spijkeniss now has the first public cultural building in history of its existence.
A Long Way to the Book
First impression: the reader's eldorado under the ceiling of cheese.
Although the elevator drives through the mountain mass, you will discover the real space and reader’s passion until the topography is rapidly achieved.
From all sides, the glass interior is bright and transparent, the floor of the burned cab and elegant street lamps clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The city environment is perfect.
You see the park clubs, the dogs and the boys and the girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Absolutely, there are books along the fasada, and in the middle there is a large dark space, which is mostly uncomfortable and unpersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built a classic space configuration upstairs, and we pulled the space for the readers out.
Interior Mountains of Books are excellently used: offices, web library, chess club, ecological center and central home technology are located on Wednesday.
The special satisfaction is the black sheets of books that are one of the walls, one parapet and another by stairs.
Appearance, structure and smell acts alien.
Over the unknown construction material, even sworn architects and construction engineers.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," said Joop Truborst, head of the project in the city village of Spijkenisse, on the question of the magazine Standard.
So, in a fryz agricultural company, one day we ran into a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years it is used in glasses and fields in the Netherlands as a basis under the roots of the millimeter rouno of synthetic material.
It's cheap and time-effective.
The thin textile holds one, two seasons and then is mature to throw into a huge waste.
For the library, the first time in this quantity - was taped on the tables with four inches thick.
With the effect of the light and pressure, so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) is colored in dark, homogenous and burdenable material that smells a little like a new car and a little like sports shoes.
After 105 stairs, you'll get to the top.
At the end of nearly 500 meters of long travel, you will be rewarded not only by a fantastic view of the city but also by the Dutch croquets and ficuses in flowers.
They care about the atmosphere, but especially for the right wetness of air in the mountain of literature.
Gifts for a new soul
"You may not believe this, but this house is a visual project for ecology, despite many glass areas," says Trouborst.
It's melting and cooling with the earth's warmth.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass gate, the sun lights inside only a short time, even in the sunny days.
The broad sticked wooden trailers standing close to the glass fassage, serve as shading and capture a large part of sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
He'll deal with the rest of it fully with automatic rolls.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, has already visited a new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also a teacher of the traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who even called Boekenberg "the long-expected soul" of Spijkeniss.
Reason: Every city inhabitant was invited to open a few weeks ago to devote one book from his personal fund.
So optical spaces were to be filled in the library not fully equipped, which currently reads 70,000 pieces.
The concept has been successful.
The police are completely filled.
"There's nothing worse than a half-purpose library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think our invitation has a relationship with each inhabitant now.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if she was in the decoration.
This has resulted in a royal discipline called the creation of identity in the expert chargone.
Spikenisse wrote the history of literature.
Anyway, he's young and unemployed.
This is finally the default point for identity.
Sabo: "The Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany has delayed its voting in the decision to adopt Palestine.
According to the expert on relations between the United States and Europe, Stephen Szaboa, Berlin is balancing on a narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first reported in the beginning of the week that it would vote against the proposal for the observer status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.
But then Berlin delayed the vote.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
However, Germany must now be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think they'll support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, being too critical to Israel.
During the rebellion in Libya in March 2011, Germany also held a vote in favour of the establishment of a unemployment zone.
That's what NATO finally planted.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear view of serious international topics?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it's just changing its foreign policy, and it's the way from the policy that was so-called U.S. controlled, to the German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult that the Europeans do not have coherent and united policies.
So the Germans are between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just living in their role, but they're on their way to "normal" foreign politics.
For foreign politics they have in France or Great Britain.
What does "normal" foreign policy in German mean?
It shows the willingness to engage in national interests and attitudes that are independent of the positions of the United States or European partners.
I think the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, export and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are somewhat different than the economic interests of other powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have economic interests affected the position in the Middle Eastern conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has a large residence in the Middle East, especially in the countries around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to frighten the public, but not to the elite in the Arab countries.
Anyway, it plays a role.
But I don't want to associate too much, it's not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, it plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany's relations with the United States been damaged when, in the case of both important decisions, the vote has been delayed, for example, in the voting of Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding for the German attitude.
That's why I don't think it was such a dramatic breakdown as in Libya.
I hope that Germany even takes out some respect.
This indicates that it must be considered an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views of the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
In addition, the United States made it clear for veto.
Is there a difference between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of an American internal policy.
I think Obam's government may have a significant understanding for the European position.
But as a result of the political situation there, this attitude cannot, of course, be public.
I don't think the differences in views are really as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relations between Obama and the Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not much excited by Netanjahu's policy at all.
Is it not difficult for Germany to agree with their close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and with the position of the EU's most important partners on the other hand?
I think that's exactly what makes the Germans difficult.
It would, of course, be a little easier for Germany if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not happening at present.
So they cannot be part of a broader line and must instead move things forward from their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the leading role in the future and will push Europe to the European position.
Of course, it is not easy for Germany because of the relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player? Does he even want to take the main role?
Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable, and for this country, it is still difficult to play a greater role for obvious reasons.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, every time Germany takes a greater role, anti-Germany moods will rise.
It doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
In this regard, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable for different neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
The U.S. influence in European policy is still down, but the EU is not currently filling this vacuum.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even though they don't like it, it's unpleasant and it makes them even more unfavourable - c'est la vie!

"Protection of marks" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-known mark, Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
What is Armani Polo?
The marking, which is officially registered in China, is behind it, but it has nothing to do with the original company.
However, he's taking protection until real owners of the mark are charged with them.
And even then it's not clear whether the laws can be reached.
"For strangers, it is increasingly difficult to protect their marks in China," said Thomas Patloch, attorney at Taylor Wessing's office, who specializes in violating protective rights in the Remote East.
Every week, a new case will be landed on my desk.
The fakes are enough for a few additional letters to log in their marks.
For example, Gucci's mark will become Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, they will register Prada-Kny.
This is how German companies are legally copied, such as the producer of the Puma sports goods.
Pattloch opens a folder with the records of the mark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, one Chinese company had protected the trading mark of Zegna DF Puma. A skilled name that is also parasited on the fashion house of Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that Chinese are the world's masters in copying and violating mental property.
In large cities, there are several floors of trading houses with almost exclusively selling fakes.
Patloch's cases are different, but the mandate of his mandates is against the fact that Chinese companies receive from the marking office officially the right to use the markings that are already protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an associated mark.
This word focuses on Bang Dakuan.
These are women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It damages the business, we have to rub it," Patloch calls.
"The badge is settled, the exclusive position disappears, the damage to the image is awesome."
Financial losses and judicial costs of affected sectors go to millions, especially in expensive display products.
According to the CLSA market research data, China with a volume of 15 billion euros per year is the third largest market of luxury species of goods and markets, which grows as fast as possible.
However, the erasing of doubtful records in the register of marks can be achieved difficultly, and it is worth something.
Driving can stretch up to nine years, with an uncertain result.
Patloch tells us about cases when the court rejected the complaints, because the name that was marked has become after a long time of the "market reality".
When the prosecutor has a failure, he has to pay the plagiator because he damaged his mark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there's a jungle law.
Known cases also concern graphical elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the manufacturer of Sany’s construction machines, a company who recently took over the German producer pumping on the Patzmeister beton mixture.
Therefore, the Chinese may still use a symbol similar to the Mercedes Star.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue-white logo that was similar to BMW. The dispute was arranged, Geely had to change the logo.
The manufacturer of fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the known crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO CTMO acknowledges that in 2010 there were lacks due to too small numbers of employees and space.
But last year, accordingly, "the progress of the work process returned from an emergency situation to normal".
For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings decreased by 22 per cent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 per cent more than in the previous year.
Still, he's still waiting for 81,500 complaints in the office.
It's expensive to do something against it.
As often in China, these are impressive numbers.
In the last year, CTMO delivered more than 1.4 million requests for the protection of the mark, which is almost a third of over 2010.
It's a record and it means that China's subscribed behind is running a list of new applications throughout the world.
This also applies to the number of all valid protective marks - totals 5,5 million.
In 2011, 1,8 billion Yuan were charged.
Simplifiedly means that each login in average costs 1280 yuans, or 160 euros.
The issue of the German family company Freudenberg is a multiplied dispute, as indicated in the case of Freudenberg.
This concern has been fighting Chinese plagiator for over seven years.
Although the Germans have achieved annulment of his illegal production of imitated car works.
However, the counterfeit has provided Chinese rights to the Freudenberg mark.
We would not mention it ourselves, because in Germany the name cannot be protected, says Hannah Wentzler, head of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Mnichov.
The CTMO CTMO Claim office also rejected the opposition of the monk's company.
In the other two instances, Freudenberg has reached the rights, but the opponent in the fight continues to fight today.
You need to be very careful.
The matter is now discussed at the Supreme Court.
Wentzler trusts that this will lead to a good end and praise the professionality of courts.
But he also says, "The management is extremely costly, and it cost us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could not be calculated, and the company's archive had to even look into hundred years old records to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had offered a "excellent six-digit amount in euros" counterparty to compare the dispute.
"You see what this means to us," Wentzler says.
It is threatening that the risk from the remote east will also affect Europe.
And in case imitators get the unprotected marks there.
For example, one Chinese producer wanted to report the Freudenberg label for shoes and skin in Germany.
This business area has long quit, but it has been able to distort the registration.
"Wentzler says, you need to be very careful.
He and the attorney of Patloch advise German businesses to be very careful in trade with China.
It's not enough to rely on international marking rights. Foreigners would rather have "all that is worth protection in any way, sign in China," Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg in the last action of his drama falls under the mark, then he may have to pay counterparty license fees for his own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we'll be pushed from the market in a controversial segment.
World Day against AIDS: Kicking, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi congregation is tested - and in Swaziland, orphans who died of AIDS are happy.
A story of connection that overcomes much more than 8733 miles.
There's ass first: cowboy high shoes, basketball shoes, ladies' boats and men's mocasins are looking for a tactical parket, and they find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Then the seventh voices of the singers -- alt, bass, tenor and sopran -- insist, mom and mutual pursuits.
29-year-old dirigent Fiete Hopfa is almost raised from his textile shoes when he connects voices with his wild gestures.
It's Monday night. In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi congregation is testing a new song.
50 singers and singers come between 23 and 69, from a researcher of human genetics to a householder.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each congregation voice has a different text and also in a very foreign language - Zulu speaking by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotha, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help to help
Unaids, the United Nations Programme for AIDS Collapse, estimates that around 34 million people around the world are infected by HIV.
Of that, 23.5 million live in South Africa.
There are 245,000 orphans in Swaziland after parents who died of AIDS.
HIV is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after parents who died of AIDS, he found a compound of Voices for Africa's municipalities in Germany.
70 of them attends second grade school.
15 or 20 euros per month can be taken by patronate.
Guarantees the child's school, school uniform and one warm food daily in the Gogo Centre.
Imbongi means Zulu's storyteller's language, or "the one who loves."
No one can speak gas bantuic in this space but sing.
For almost ten years, the congregation has trained the songs in this soft speech and sometimes brings them back where they originally originate: in South Africa.
In the air distance of 8 733 miles from Heidelberg, there is a village of Esitjena, which depends on the strength of the German congregation’s votes.
Forty percent is infected
There are approximately 2,000 people, some still in simple clay or slammed houses, and many of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents anymore, because they subjected you to HIV.
In Esitenia, it is visible in the smallness of Swaziland: the highest infection rate of HIV, the lowest expected life length in the world according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of male predecession, which proves to reduce the risk of infection by half, is not accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland wear a weak immunity virus within them, and there is no rarely dying in less than 30 years.
This village was discovered on a joint journey after Africa on spring 2005, but mostly Imbongi members saw many children in the streets missing not only parental care, but cleanly everything: food, clothing, education.
Without complete school education, they have no more chance in the poor country.
At first, it was a private placement of individuals that allowed the child to go to school in a few euros a year and give him one warm food daily.
However, a year later, the congregation of the Voices for Africa was established, which since then cared for orphanages after parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts of sexually transmissible infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial SPI belongs to sifilis, chlamydia and capavac (gonorea).
Common virus SPI are HIV, human papilomavires, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
The bulbs and screws belong to the parasite SPI.
Who belongs to the most disastrous group?
Syphilis and the hatches appear primarily in men who have sex with men.
The institution Robert Koch is based on the fact that at least four of the five cases of syphilida reported in Germany are transferred by sexual contacts between men.
Heterosexual adults have sexually transmissible diseases that often occur, chlamydie infections, trichomonades, candidosis (flash), capavka and human papilomavires.
HIV among heterosexual adults has been spread relatively little, but approximately 20 percent of the newly infected HIV appears to this group.
Among youths, chlamydia infections are significantly more frequent than in other population groups.
According to European research, three quarters of all infections concern young people from 15 to 25 years of age.
Furthermore, human papilomavires often occur among youths.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of sifilid infected in the Constitution Robert Koch was more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of newly infected HIV people has been reduced since 2007.
In 2011 there were approximately 2700 cases.
That's about a dozen less than a year ago.
What symptoms point to sexual illness?
Infectious diseases may cause genital disorders, urinary difficulties, inflammation, pain in the woods and bubbles or nipples.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore they will not be observed.
How can you protect yourself?
Dangers may reduce condoms, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because the originators of sexually transmitted diseases may also be partially transmitted from illness and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examination, especially in the case of common sexual partners.
In the case of early diagnostic, most of the SPI can be treated and prevented by later consequences.
Thanks to the patronate, charity gifts, and in the latest number of privileges that the congregation earns through singing around Germany, some money will be gathered.
"We have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjan," said the President of the Communities, Annette Lenartz.
The money from Germany is managed in the village itself Zodwa Plamini, a self-conscious woman who can make a move.
He also cares for orphaned children to find a shelter, such as some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as it's called Zulu in the language of old women, are the support of the village.
Some of them also married 14 orphanages, gave them a roof over their heads, and they took care of their children to get into school uniforms every day.
Children who no longer have anyone go to the shelter to Khanyisile, a lonely woman paying the compound as well as two cookers who cook for more than 200 hungry children daily.
"Voices for Africa" also established a school of sewing, built two chickens, and together with the American health organization, PSI arranged that many people in the village had made an HIV test.
Even though the disease in the country is so obvious, everyone is silent about it.
The King With 14 Wives
"A AIDS is absolutely tabu," says Annette Lenartz, "because he has something to do with sexuality."
In fact, it's quite strange in the country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The latest absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known as his inconvenient lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state's approved lifestyle is also guilty of the spread of HIV in the past decades so quickly.
But even many migrant workers who broke the virus across the country.
Annette Lenartz says the condoms are on every corner for free, "but no one uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected contact."
To support at least a little cultural exchange, the Imbongi congregation travels once at two, three years along South Africa and sings songs full of grief, fighting, trust in the future and self-confidence of blacks, many in the southern black continent know from the age of apartheid.
The bus full of white people singing songs in the language of black people - such appreciation brings not only the mood and joy but also tears out in many wild border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitjan, where singers visit children over whom they have a patronate.
Even if this village is hardly found on maps, the valley of Ezulveni is more than famous.
"Go to Esithen, there's light," people say.
And if you go back to Heidelberg, which is the airline of 8733 kilometers from here, to the asshole singers at the Bergheimer Straße test, you see that the light shines here.
Messenger: NASA discovered on Mercury Ice
Sonda Messenger found evidence that there's ice on the Mercury planet.
The ice cover could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The American National Aviation and Aviation Authority (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also freezing water, as it comes from three studies published by the Science magazine on Thursday.
Sonda Messenger found evidence that there is an ice cover in the area of this planet, which lies in a permanent shadow.
It is allegedly at least 30 inches, and perhaps even 20 metres strong.
This water came from all the comets or perhaps from the asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let's not put the ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said the leaders of the scientists working on the Messenger Sonde Sean Solomon.
The temperature at Mercury may reach up to 426 degrees of Celsia.
However, findings could help us explain how water and other basic elements of life came into other areas of the solar system.
Sondy, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix, unsighted landmen, are participating in exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, images come to Earth, small windows to infinite distances.
The picture comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists from the Institute Maxe Planck.
Eight planets of our solar system, in addition to the Patch Planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who circles around the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not under a new definition of the International astronomical Union of 2006 "planet".
This cut out of the infrared Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of unbroken generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, the worse identifiable are pinkly colored "new-displayed" in the starborn hall.
The area where stars are formed - scientists are not romanticly called W5 - was discovered by Spitzer's telescope in the Cassiopeia co-star at a distance of 6500 light years.
This alternate light dying stars caught NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The ring is composed of the material that the star embarrassed during the dying process.
In the giant fog Trifid, a distance of 5400 light years from the Earth, the gas and dust of the new star are emerging.
The galaxy "collenge" photographed the NASA Spitzer Telescope.
The Star of the Playade, also called "Seven Sisters", is seen with only an eye at night.
The telescope will make colors better.
Fog Helix can look like a red eye on this infrared image.
It is located at the distance of 700 light years from the co-stars of the Water.
Her similarity with the earthly world has brought out this fog named North America.
Combination of normal and infrared photograph is the source of unusual coloring.
This "baby" between the stars was able to rent up in full beauty to the infrared detectors of Spitzer's telescope.
Saturn and his rings: how they emerged is one of the greatest astronomical mystery.
Hopefully it's the remains of Saturn's month, which disappeared 4,5 billion years ago without a sign.
One of the biggest and most sharpest pictures of Hubble's telescope: viral galaxy
The images of spiral galaxies, according to their coloring, become real artwork.
The scope published by the European South Observatory presents several thousand light years a remote mist of Trifid in the star of the Shooter.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (separated to three parts, trichlan) because the dark bars of dust divide the heart of this star breeding into three parts.
In the Hadonos star, astronomers photographed the prediction of a cosmic collapse: at 400 million light years from the Earth, they have to collaborate with the core of two galaxies infantile.
This birth of the star was recorded by Hubble's telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
Who doesn't like technical shortcuts, can call it a nickname South Wind.
The photo of Hubble's space-controlled remote view shows an outbreak of Iris' fog in Cefea's congestion.
These 1400 light years, the distant fog consists of dust grains, which are ten to a hundred times smaller than the usual domestic dust.
This picture was composed of optical and rentgen images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring from the black holes, which is far away from the Earth of 430 million light years.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273, recorded the Hubble's space-control view for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star fog there is the clearest group of young stars in our Milk Way.
A wheel of stars gives rise to the new increases.
Also, this star cloud, connected to Rosette's fog, is still born by new young stars. They are away for 5,000 light years from the Earth.
There's no dust yet in this clear glowing galaxy with a small black hole, but only gas.
Scientists believe that it only occurred shortly after the Great Short, when the whole universe was mainly a hydrogen.
Our views for the universe: the most important telescopes
Dalecoview reportedly invented in 1608 Hans Lipperhey. He used it a year later before Galileo Galileo to observe stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical remote views have continued to grow - and the views they intermediate are increasingly deeper.
The world's greatest distant view was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope at the observatory of Palomar near San Diega.
The mirror on this picture had a diameter of five meters.
In American Arizona, Large Binocular Telescope stands.
It allows you to look into the universe right away with two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 meters.
Inside Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only a mirror measures a diameter of 10.4 metres.
The mirror Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to reduce costs.
Still, its average reaches approximately 11 meters.
Inconvenience of a cheap construction mode: the telescope is secured by hackling in the altitude, thus limiting its movement.
The Hobby-Eberla telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height angle.
His speciality is a high increase in the light flow.
Despite a relatively small mirror mirror, this is equal to the world’s largest mirrors.
With radiotelescope in Arecib (Portorico), scientists in the universe are searching for alien signals.
This radio telescope has an average of 305 meters.
With "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - searching for extraterrestrial intelligence can help any owner of the computer that provides its calculation performance.
View of the observation of the European South Observatory (ECO) in the Chilean Andes.
Very Large Telescope stands here and honors his name.
This remote view with a total of four mirrors can also enlighten the middle infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large view is also planned on the Chile Observatory of the ESO.
His main mirror is to be full of 42 meters and is composed of nearly 1,000 mirrors.
However, the images can be calculated first in 2018.
Two Keck's long-term views on the Hawaii Sup Mauna Kea were considered the biggest in the world by 2007.
They offer two mirrors right away, each with a diameter of ten meters.
Kekk's remote views are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, besides them, is watching the universe and using the Subarus and IRTTF telescope.
A new giant telescope is also to be created on Mauna Kea - with a 30-meter mirror diameter.
Here you can admire him on the picture.
However, the most important impressions from the universe have been transmitted to us by Hubble's cosmic remote view.
It's been provided with us since 24 April 1990.
The Space Telescope Kepler is looking for from March 2009 to extrasolary planets - especially after the residents.
On 2 February 2011 NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets have been discovered since the start of the mission.
The last preparations are documented before the Kepler Space Telescope is launched.
The universe remote view of James Webb (JWST) will first be fired into the universe in 2018 on board of missile Ariane5.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for the light of the first stars and the galaxies after the Great Shook.
Scientists come from the fact that there's ice in the southern field of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this, because the Messenger is circling around this planet far closer to the northern field.
Radar measurement has shown that there is ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the Messenger sond, which was sent in 2004 and is the first to run around Mercury, scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter daily and live 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live in a Bible age.
There's even a long-term museum.
Looking for tracks in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live in a Bible age.

Looking for tracks in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
I'll take Talysh off the mountain, we can call it wildly romantic.
The microbus scratches the road with many turns along the dense forest hills, wooden rivers and simple rural buildings.
Everything is green and juicy, almost seems to be in Schwarzwald.
But this is the latest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few miles away.
This is the Kaucasian ethnic group of Talys, which is not known too much, except that he speaks perfectly Persian and Azerbaijan and experiences a very high age.
The final station is Lerick.
This town is carried out with too monumental architecture from the Soviet times, which is unlikely in the picture of the mountain.
Tourists from Europe are not coming here. The arrival from the Azerbaijan capital of Baku is too difficult.
It takes 8 hours for 323 miles, because the road is only one-road.
The tale wealth that the land owes oil in the Caspic Sea has not yet arrived in the villages.
However, Pilate Fatulajeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the Great Price of Eurovision in May - and we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world next year," Fatulajeva says.
She's the director of the Museum of Long Ages, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the documented life of nearly eight dozens of Talys from the surrounding area who are 100 years old. Fatulajeva shows black white photos.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
When he was 136 years old, he was still a child.
However, a disputed star of this museum was the sheep sheep shepherd Müslümov, who was allegedly 168 years old.
There is no birth sheet, of course.
And since the oldest person with documents was 122 years old, Muslüm's age seemed extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," explained Fatulajeva.
This man was allegedly married three times and had 23 children, and at 136 years old he was still born to his daughter.
Did they not make mistakes at the age of Muslümov for a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist of the Constitution of Maxe Planck in Rostock, also heard of the summer people in Central Asia.
"And many high-aged people live in some areas of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also many very old men live in Sardinia."
However, no scientific evidence of age can be provided because of missing grounds, especially when matrix is missing.
Each day of dissolved butter glass
But the fact is that people around Leric often experience Bible age.
There are now 20 people who are 100 years old.
So why do so many old people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijan guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this by the special genes of Talish.
The director of the Fatulev Museum believes that it is in food.
However, the fact that the caloric food of Talys, who loves meat, bread, and especially milk products, and of which many drinking a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, it does not seem exactly true in bromatological terms.
Or is this the original way of life that maintains young people? In the Cengemed, a small situation near the city of Lerik, the residence of Rubab Mirzaev.
At 97 years, she is relatively young on this width.
Mirzaeva, who claims that he has 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the whole Kaucasian region.
He's sitting on the ground with the massacre he's intimately collaborating.
Under one roof, there are eight people, including one of the sons of Mirzajeva and the daughter, both of them are a long time ago grandparents.
Two little kids are jumping around.
The kitchen is preparing for guests a tea that is given in typical stomach glasses "armadu".
The white teeth of Mirzajev forms a perfect series and hides a long, dark blond copy that her son is proudly revealing before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so I didn't look like it, and they kept the color.
"I've never used a shampoo, too," Mirzaeva says.
Monthly Retirement to Life Is All
She's always eating what comes from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, grahs.
I haven't bought food in the supermarket for my whole life.
Then he tells me about his man who was in the army.
It was the worst of the second world war.
But everything has improved when he took over "loved father" Geidar Aliev.
Propaganda sounds weird from the old woman's mouth.
However, the cult that is made around the character of the father of the nations who ruled his country as a dictator is no limit in Azerbaijan.
He was in power by 2003, and then he took over his son Ilham.
At least old people in Azerbaijan don't suffer the need.
Mirzaeva receives a retirement of 230 manats every month (about the same amount in euros). This is for the ratios that can benefit well from.
And perhaps he's right, even a long ago grey son of Mirzajev, "Old people live in our culture of great seriousness."
They live in the middle of a big family, they are loved, cared and happy.
If that's not the reason to stay alive as long as possible
The term "human rights" in the Constitution is missing
The revolution returned to Cahira.
The demonstration in Cairo revealed a deep diversity of the country.
A sharp discussion is discussed on the future constitution based on the law of the chariya.
The Egyptian President did not save the patos.
We have to create a transition.
"And for doing so, I'm responsible for the people and before God," he said in the state television.
His speech was appointed to the entire nation, especially to Christian kopts, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and secular persons.
All those, yet hopelessly disputed in confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the "God State" in Nile issued for mercy to the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi almost apologized that he restricted the competence of the Constitutional Court and extended his own to "save the revolution".
However, what a 61-year-old engineer who has the title of the American University in South California really wants to save, Egyptians or the world are not clear.
Should the judiciary be removed from power?
234 paragraphs, which the 100-headed Constitutional Meeting with the prevailability of Islamists has quickly approved in the 15-hour night maraton, partially raise anxiety.
Just as in the previous institutions, it is said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic Law".
But what does "the rule" mean?
It was and is a matter of interpretation and can be feared that Islamists will use this irregular formulation and the connected legal free space with it for a stricter interpretation of the chari.
At least this highlights the newly added paragraph: In all matters relating to the chariya, it is necessary to consult the university of al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic Institute in the country with great influence on the whole sunny Islam.
This must not be necessary, but it may mean that Clerus will supervise the law enforcement, which would bring justice to real deprivation of its right.
There are many interpretations in the Constitution proposal
The problem is also that civil competence of military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served for Mubarak's governments to oppress opposition.
After the dictation fall, there were up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
As the proposal states, it should also protect the "right essence of the Egyptian family and support its morals and values".
This is so legally formulated that, through this paragraph, state institutions may even check the contents of film art and literature.
In a clear speech, it means nothing but censure.
In addition, no paragraphs in writing define the explicit equality of men and women.
Hence, another paragraph prohibits hanobit or condemns the prophet Mohamed and his ambassador.
However, it remains clear what is shameful and how it will be pursued.
However, there is doubt that the formulation is prohibited by "offense of people".
Is the president's cartoon enough in this case or a joke on the account of law experts?
The matter of interpretation, as many more in this proposal, which Mursi will submit to the signature and, according to his words, will "be very soon" present to the Egyptians for the purpose of human voting.
"The revolution has returned"
For weeks, opposition has been formed against the excess of Islamic.
Thousands of people gathered together on Friday night at Tahrír Square in Kahir and promised to destroy the constitutional paper before it starts to pay.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabáhi, who was situated in the presidential elections in the third place.
The Nobel Price holder and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baraday, declared that the draft of the Constitution belongs to "the trash of history".
By means of a short news service, Twitter accused Mursi's advocate that they wanted to perform "puč against democracy".
"If the referendum announces, we go to his palace and throw it away," said Jasir Said's opposition member.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet punished," the Egyptian media of the opposition politician Chalid Alius quoted.
Several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would become incorrect.
"The Quran is our Constitution"
The well - organized Muslim Brotherhood declared a supernatural monstracy, but not in Tahrír Square, but after a massive prayer on the second shore of Nile before the Cahir University.
She had attended a number of secret women and fans of the salaphists who cried: "The people require the application of the law of God."
They called Mursey, "Clean the land!" and assured, "The Quran is our constitution."
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic square of Tahrir, where it all started, would probably cause a state like a civil war.
Mursi's servants obviously didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim brotherhood declared that opponents and advocates of the constitution’s proposal were loudly and clearly expressed.
Now it's time for the people to decide where the country should go.
Most of the islamic proposals are considered certain.
"The word 'man's rights' does not occur once."
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, is appointed by Hafize Abú Sa'du.
Forty-five-year-old Protector of Human Rights and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or were standing before the court.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because human rights are unseparable to him.
He was beaten, convicted and imprisoned for it.
"And in the new constitution, there are no words "human rights" now," he complains in the interview for "Welt am Sontag".
Mursi's expansion of power to all three power bodies in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandal blame against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civil society, the president actually canceled it," Sa'da complains.
However, without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community watching the match of ideological fractions in Nile with the mixture of curiosity and tension.
It could be revenge for him.
The demonstrator on Tahrier Square warns, "You have created a monster you can't control."
Norwegian Racfisk: The most smelling fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of country's success be linked to the local appetite for extraordinarily smelling fish?
Take some screwed cheese.
Put them in the middle of a bunch of dirty and wet football equipment.
Leave it down for a week.
So you'll get a scent of a paralyzing smell of racphis, one of the biggest Norwegian delicates.
I'm in a small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's a snow, a beautiful look - and there's a scent in the air.
Rakfisk is a salt spray quasified in water for a year - depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As the darkness and it starts to be cold, Norwegians are starting to meet here in Fagernes at the festival dedicated to how to say the best, most deceptive food.
"You eat it raw and then you drink it with a glass aquavit," says Howard Halvarsen, local professional firefighter, but also the so-called Racfisk General, responsible for the Festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat small fish cubes and drink them with a lot of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit than a racfisk," says Howard.
The drink can overtake the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's like a piece of sushi that was on a long road by the bus.
Rakfisk is a very different product of the time when poverty was in Norway, and since there were no refrigerators, fish was wearing into water and salt air vessels on the autumn.
Then, in the middle of the winter, when they were well quaxed, pulled out and ate - the senses of the winter, of course, were absorbed by alcohol.
One generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their land and seek work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Currently, the population is rapidly growing - more than 13% of the immigrants are attracted to a large quantity of work, high earnings and a large system of care.
The residents of Sweden, an old rival, which has recently been much richer than Norway, are streaming into the country for work.
The racfisk is seen as something important, independent, even though a relatively smelling part of the Norwegian past.
It belongs to more expensive food on the market.
Even though the expensive is everything - a little glass of beer or sandwich you will go out to 9 pounds ($14) for a piece.
Norway often does not get into the world's news - and most people seem to be so suitable.
The name of Anders Breivik, the right racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, here people still mention unlikely.
Instead, the shooting is called "Adolescent of 22 July".
Norwegians can only hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
In the current wealth of Norway, one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries from the early 70s of the twentieth century.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," says our waitress Anna, who with her long blond hair and surprisingly blue eyes represents a prototype of Nordic prosperity.
We're, as you call us, respectful people.
Her English, like English most of the people here, is absolutely perfect.
We don't show up, we don't like showing.
Norway is very careful with its oil wealth - except a small percentage, most of the money in this sector is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When all the others in the years leading to a global financial collapse, no money they had, the Norwegians had a firmly pinch on their guest.
"Well, as long as we can ski and go on trips in the summer, we're happy," Anna says.
"And eating a racfisk," he adds with an eager laugh.
I'm standing in a snow in the queue for something to eat. I've got enough of a raffic.
Such a losy burger must be something else and it's beautifully juicy.
But tonight, the smelling fish is back here.
The hotel in which I live is one of the many places where the racfisk is given for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for the most difficult fish.
They have a connection with a live television transmission in which a butterfly moderator is surrounded by bowls with rafis.
It's like a singing competition Eurovision.
"What is your score for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergen?"
"There's our pointing, Howard."
It's about applause and laughing.
A man will fall from the chair, perhaps aquavit.
Or maybe the exhaustion of all those fish.
Enrique Pena Neto from Mexico has a difficult start
As the Mexican President Enrique Pena Neto is preparing to take over the office, Will Grant from BBC is looking at the challenges he faces, and the mixed expectations of his companions.
Transport to Mexico City is particularly bad at present.
In the city that is stuck in the best times, steel barriers were raised to close several key routes to the capital and caused on the roads of chaos.
However, the goal was not to prevent those coming to get into work, but to prevent protesters from accessing the parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico Enrique Pena Neto will receive the presidential scarp and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a difficult task.
Mexico did well economically in the time of the departing Felipe Calderon, but the country was in a drug war that already estimated to be the victim of 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people in reducing violence," President Pena Neto told US President Barack Obam at the Oval workshop at the beginning of this week.
I will design a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before he shake his hand with the American President, President Pena Neta won political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
The views of the new leader are also different in his old homeland, the people and the large state surrounding the capital.
Direct man.
For example, in the village city of Valle del Bravo, they remember him in good.
Citizens associate him with the development of tourism in the aircraft and construction of infrastructure.
You can now travel to the city by one of the new roads that Pena Neto left to build. These roads are a huge improvement against the hole and throat roads that were here before.
The boards with his name also hang on the wall of the modern sports center and the impossible interactive museum with climate change theme.
"We expect it to bring a real and lasting change," said Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, State Ambassador for President Pen Net, the Party of the Institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
Especially, we hope for the interesting and real changes in the area of security and economy that our country needs so necessarily.
After 81 years in force, the PRI party was pushed by Vicent Fox.
Ambassador Olver acknowledges that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there is a lot to expect from Enriqua Pen Net.
And he rejects the expression of opposition characterizing the new president as a person without a substantial content.
He's a very straight-handed man, very busy with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a great state, and he's mostly a person who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not the impression of his former governor.
In Nehaulcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, can't be contrast with valle del Bravo streets more apparent.
He's stuck under the roadways in a lot of reminders of the suburb of Mexico's capital itself.
And the problems in the self-regular community are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army was called to help deal with drug gangs operating in the quarters, especially influential, is violence against women.
Only in the last two years, the bodies of dozens of murdered women were thrown in empty places next to the huge garbage of waste.
During the time Pena Neto was governor, more than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico, which is much more than the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is a sinonym for the murders of innocent women.
In a better case, the critics of Pena Neta say that he failed to deal with the problem of women's murders in his office.
And in worse, his leadership is accused of closing his eyes.
In a concrete house, typical for the deadly neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me photos of her dead daughter Mariana Luna and suppresss cry.
According to the official version, Marian committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that her partner killed her.
"When I arrived in her house, it seemed like her body washed," remembers Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs of hits on him, and after-death collapse has already started.
As her mother tells a story, Mariana is looking down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross on which the only word is "justice".
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they were denied.
The government authorities treated me as if I was an old talk, a troubled one, and a knife.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it can't be right when there were so many mistakes and I'm reminding," he says.
The sherpa that President Pena Neto receives on Saturday is accompanied by a great responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of families in Mexico were affected by violent crime and the new president promised that during his work in the office would be his priority.
"I hope that he will be the same president as the governor," the Member of Olver said in Valle del Bravo.
But that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Ne fear the most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about wrong treatment, says the military prosecutor.
The military prosecutor is trying to reverse Bradley Manning's claim on a rude treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military detention in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be rejected on the basis of a rough treatment with Manning in prison.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that the soldier Bradley Manning, who is accused of the biggest escape of secret material in the US history, has missed many possibilities to complain about the rough treatment that he reportedly suffered in military custody.
The military prosecutor May. Ashden Fein, during the cross interrogation of soldier Manning at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede in Maryland, claimed that the records of the weekly visits that Manning had with the officers of the unit during nine months of custody in Quantico in Virginia did not show any complaints about the wrong treatment.
The cross-examination that occurred during the hearing carried out on the proposal for defense to reject the case led against Manning due to rough treatment during the period of detention, which was sufficient on itself, took place a day after Manning testified that he considered suicide in custody.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents in his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At the Friday hearing, the military prosecutor Fein and Manning carried out the forms that officers met with Manning in the Quantico prison, where he was held in the regime with increased security from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that the treatment of his guards was "excellent" and the total treatment of the device was "very professional".
Forms do not show any complaints about wrong treatment, even though the officers of Manning directly asked how it was treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that his concerns about various problems expressed orally and that the officers who visited him talked to him about these concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but did not record these problems.
"They wrote "no problems" (only after they discussed concerns), and that did not necessarily mean that I didn't mention them," said Manning.
Judge Colonel Denise Lind also asked Manninga why he did not complain about the treatment of his person in January 2011 when he met with a committee assessing the suicide thoughts that he expressed in the form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during this meeting it was his intention to achieve a reduction in the "prevention of injuries" regime.
The Army stated that this restrictive regime (one degree under surveillance regime) used it for the protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I'm okay and that I wanted to cancel this system of prevention of injuries... so that I could enjoy an increased quality of life as I saw," said Manning.
Manning witnessed on Thursday his arrest in Iraq and transport to Kuwait, where he was held nearly two months before he was transported to the marine prison base in Quantico in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait, and one of the reasons for warmth went down there.
He stated that the fact that he was not allowed to know what will happen with him and what happens in the surrounding world was very distressing.
"My world only smashed to the base of Arifjan, to that cell," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cell.
Manning stated that after arrival in Quantica, he spent most days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was allowed to have only one mattress, cover, garments, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleeping or just laying down was against the laws during the day.
Manning said that he always slept with light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned on the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's legal representative filed a formal complaint on the treatment of soldier Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Maninga also asked about the charges he filed in the fourth deposition on the fact that after he was forced to sleep one night in his cell in Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked before the guards and other colleagues in the morning counting.
Manning told me he wasn't allowed to cover his cover in counting.
During the Friday interrogation, Judge Manning stated that he judged from his guards that he had a cover that he could cover himself, but confessed that no one gave him the order to defer it.
On Thursday, Manning confessed that he was forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to show the officer that he wasn't dangerous.
Manning stated that he told the officer he could use his underwear belt or his guts to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning confessed that that night his underwear, his guts and glasses were removed from his cell.
His legal representative hopes that the judge will take into consideration his experience of his imprisonment and that in the case of his conviction before the military court whose beginning is expected at the beginning of the next year, his punishment is significantly reduced.
The defense stated that Manning plans to confess to blame for lower crimes and that he will fight against other charges because they are too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is scheduled for this week, the military prosecutor is expected to defend the conditions of liaison as eligible.
Pentagon stated that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions relating to all arrested in custody with maximum security.
Among the charges raised against Manning include the help of the enemy, the illegal cause of the publication of the reporting documents on the Internet, the transfer of information concerning national security and theft of public property or records.
If he's accused at all points, he can be convicted for life.
My crisis of Mexico-American identity
He says many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the insufficient possibilities there.
The Mexicans are inclined to blame those who have left; they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says the Mexican Americans are stuck between the two worlds.
At the last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely struck myself with a crowd and arrived in the space for an immigrant agency where I encountered a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of the two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" and the other for "Extranieros" ("Cizinci").
I stood there for a few seconds, and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I was called Mexican all my life.
It's an ethnic shortcut, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves "Iris" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italia".
So later, I ended up with the mexican name.
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, it wasn't necessary to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
However, I don't have the word stock of a child speaker and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood in front for Extranjeros.
I've been thinking about the moment this week, the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Neto visited President Obama's White House.
The programme had common issues that were discussed when the leaders of these two countries met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Neito also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why the Mexicans are likely to stay in Mexico as they travel to the United States.
He wants to connect with the United States and Canada and to create a trading block similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Neto promised to continue the Mexican war against drug cartels, even though he didn't provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of enemy feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States attacked Mexico and forced its leader under threat of weapons to overwrite half of the Mexican territory in the United States.
But for Mexicans who are thinking in the range of centuries, not minutes, the comments are everywhere present.
So a minute after the representative of the United States says something just a little critical about Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press and between the elite of complaints about how the Americans interfere with their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma will step to the warway.
Yet, Mexico is a real challenge for more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about enemy feelings?
There's plenty of them.
There are winners and defeats in Mexico, people whom the country offers opportunities, and others who do not.
The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that in some point of our family tree, there was a person, perhaps a parent or grandfather who had been denied the opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it seemed, this person responded to the profile - dark skin, weak education, origin of a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and are loyal to them.
Not with Mexico.
And even if we live a American dream now, we go to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live an American dream, not Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be irrelevant, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
Besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and view us as a subsequent race that is not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico are never strong enough.
Our existence is based on their views only of failure.
If our families weren't failing in Mexico, they would never leave him.
And now we would not be trapped for a silk tyre, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and when she was a child, has legally traveled to the United States, reminds me that there is tension between the Mexicans and the Mexican Americans, because the Mexicans understand more who they are, and the Mexican Americans do not like it.
Although she is a United States citizenship, she sees herself as part of the two countries.
And at the same time, many of the Mexican Americans I know don't feel part of any.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You'll get the best from both countries, but you don't have the roots in one.
In Mexico, they look at us as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And to make relations even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and part of intelligence, as I learned during my trip, want to reconnect to the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provision ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American companions how great it is to visit this country, and to push political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
Nope.
That's not what's going to happen.
Too much enemy feelings.
And thanks to the inequality of income and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that this is a great country.
I feel like it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not willing to forgive the way they treated Mexico a century ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel trouble about how they treated their family members in a substantially closer past.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The closing of the fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be a permanent peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another circle of bloodshed suggests that every such thing is worthless.
Among the usual unnecessary guessing of who started it, many buildings were converted into ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of the civilians, and six Israelis. And the first time the missiles from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropol, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelis and the Palestinians seemed to be stuck in their ancient conflict, the Middle East changes around them.
The Arab spring changed the old orders and the Palestinians and the Israelites, whether they like it or not, are captured in a mess in the region.
It may cause their fight to be even more bloody than ever before.
Nevertheless, there are reasons to think that this could interrupt their fatal pat situation.
A war that is not winned or lost.
At first, it seems that there are no many reasons for optimism at present.
Even if the stopping of the fire closed on 21 November, the fighting of this week strengthened the jarberries on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has been ruling in Gaza since 2007, will claim that they have forced the Israelites to retreat, even though Gaza suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several leaders of Hamas and closing 1,7 million of Gaza’s inhabitants in one of the most sad and most peoplely corners of the planet, Hamas was unable to destroy Israel.
And indeed, Hamas gains an impact on the West Coast, another piece of Palestine, which is currently managed by his rivals from Fatah, a modest Palestinian fraction.
Furthermore, the leaders of Hamas can very well judge that time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the Arab world have been more influenced, so Hamas has gained powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, the resurrected regional power, which was once the nearest Muslim Alliance of Israel, joined the side of Hamas, as well as Katar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Bay.
The people from Hamas say that the Islamic half-month is around Israel, north of Lebanon, where the side/milica Hizballah is ruled over Syria, where the rebels who are increasingly enthusiastic to Islamic can sit down Basar Asada until Jordan, where allies of Hamas threaten the kings.
And above all, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt has changed on the southern wings of Israel, from the farest and hardest Arab country, the balance in the region.
Gusny Mubarak, secular despot, which ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas, and his leaders are more influenced by the public opinion.
In the future diplomacy, Hamas can appear as a player who cannot be excluded either by Israel or by America.
On the contrary, Israeli advocates of hard lines will come to the opposite conclusions.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in the box.
The Israeli antiracetic system The Iron Coop has proved its price, and many missiles of Hamas have been destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unearthless as always. Many European countries have also blamed Hamas for the beginning of the last round of violence.
And mostly - Israel has prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamina Netanjahua, the presidency of the government, which mostly ignored the peace process.
Even though the missiles in Gaza had killed about 30 Israeli men since 2004, in Israel there was relatively calm from suicide bombers, partly thanks to the wall that interferes with the West Bank, the main part of what the Palestinian State may once be, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite their illegality against international law.
The Prime Minister Netanjah, whose party Likud, at the beginning of the campaign held on 22 January, connected with a more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.
Why blurify those prominent Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled on the West Bank, wouldn't they fire missiles like their landlords in Gaza?
It'll be better if we hold them behind the wall and hit them when they push their heads.
The standers may win a hard line, but the Arab spring can change their accounts.
Even though Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not have too much love for Israel, their primary priority will be dealing with domestic problems.
Israel’s costs for defence are higher than the costs of all its four Arab neighbours together.
The opening of a new war with local supermocy can barely help new Arab governments to recover their economy.
The fact that President Mursi worked with President Barack Obama to achieve the ceasefire is a good sign and can mean a start of something new.
The Israelites should also look at this situation in a long - term view.
At the time the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, it creates the opposition of the rights of the Palestinians to self-determination of the vessel with a fire dust, which one day must explode in the areas of Israeli occupied -- just like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
The repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographic is making the situation worse as the Arab population grows.
Bloody gases against Gaza, which take place every few years in order to push Hamas, will be increasingly choosing diplomatic taxes.
Both sides need incentives outside.
The answer is what reasonable people report on both sides, the majority of the outside world and the following newspapers: two states when Israel moves the territory for security.
In a short-term view, there is a little hope that the ceasefire will provide pressures from the outside at least a little greater impact on this matter.
Egypt, who, together with Turkey and Qatar, must plant to stop the supply of weapons to Gaza, has a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the borders of 1967 with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs of the outside must also push the coincidence between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty in the United Nations to create a Palestinian State.
President Obama also has his work on how to get Israel to the desk.
In his first election period, he disregarded the presentation of his own peace plan.
Now, back to the White House, he seemed equally disgusting in his entry into the process.
That's sadly short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful comparison between Israel and the Palestinians.
Acts on ugly cigarette packages entered into force in Australia
In the inexpected green boxes that are the same for all tobacco marks, there are warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body.
The Australian laws on the ugly packagings of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of their species in the world, and the log and colors of the marks replaced the general olive green boxes with disgusting pictures of the sick parts of the body and the view of children and newborns who have suffered from smoking by their parents.
In addition to various health warnings and pictures, from Saturday, the only difference between the boxes is the names of marks that are printed by the same small letter.
This is the most strict regime in the world regarding the packing of tobacco.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to disturb young people from smoking by eliminating their attraction.
It is based on studies that show that if people do not start smoking at age 26, 99% is the chance that they will never start smoking.
"I in very small children, you can see that he understands the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell to them with their product," says the Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that, for example, showed that children are connecting the crown in logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and changes will only have a small impact on the profits of supernational companies, other countries consider the introduction of similar steps.
The tobacco industry has lobbed hardly against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies argued that this law would increase black market trade, leading to cheaper and available cigarettes.
"With this legislation, there will be serious unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre from British American Tobacco Australia.
The counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products to be sold on Australian streets.
Others say the laws have increased their trades.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarette packages from silicone served to cover disgusting boxes two months ago, when British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeals on the laws of the Australian highest court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha stated that Zico sold nearly 6,000 pieces to trade sellers and expects new supplies.
It's a good business for us.
As a possible disturbance, experts indicate the popularity of social media in the demographic group on which the plan is focused.
Throughout a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsoring sports events and demanding that most sellers hide cigarettes from direct view, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has prohibited Internet advertising by local companies and websites, but it cannot limit foreign sites.
"If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you have only this small space for promoting your products, the online space for you is an unbelievable place in which you want to be," says Becky Freeman, researcher at the University of Sydney.
Mrs. Freeman recorded an increase in the rating of marks on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, performed by "the average Honzo".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has made this job and created this video, or is it involved in the marketing company?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry focused on how it puts new rules rather than on marketing.
The sector went so far that it paid Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacking new legislation - the countries within the World Trade Organization declare that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia are dealing significantly.
The decision of the SOO is expected in the middle of 2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has conducted interviews with other governments that consider similar laws relating to packagings.
Canada was the first country that introduced mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
They have now spread into more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The more strict laws are considered by the United Kingdom, New Zealand, the South African Republic and India.
Many chickens in Australia resist.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"Only pull out your cigarette and put your box back," says Victor El Hage when you buy a box with a tumor photograph in your mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason to stop smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in the centre of Sydney, claims that the single boxes make it harder for him to compare to regulars.
"I took one hour to deliver my cargo, now it takes me four hours," said Yu.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, "Okay, that's the end, we'll close the shop," he said and broke his hands.
In the world of continuous connection, it's not so bad to be bored.
The last Thanksgiving Day I spent five hours unexpectedly at the airport when our plane had mechanical trouble and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So we had a lot of time to think about boring.
I won't lie to you.
Hanging half-day at the airport for the next flight is pretty nauseous, even though distractions of books, magazines and iPhone (not talking about duty-free trades).
But some scientists and experts on child development are increasingly coming with praise of boring themselves.
They say that for us (and our children) it is good to be bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go into interesting directions, which can support creativeness.
And since most of us are constantly attached to a screen today, we have no chance to enjoy boring.
So should we support the boring?
Yes.
Oh, no.
But I'll go back to that.
First of all, as many people, I assumed that boring is a relatively new phenomenon that happened with the arrival of more free time.
But as says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University in Calgary, who is the author of the book Boredom: A Lively History (History of nudy) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, it's boring a long history," he said.
On the walls in Pompeii, a Latin inscription on boringness was found from the first century of our year.
And then the question is how we define boring.
The problem is that it was defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After seeing research literature and showing the idea of the target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boring as a experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't capable of it."
The boring is different from the apathy by not being involved in anything, but she would like to be.
He says there's no force in appaity to do anything.
He says the core of boring is "a disturbance of the process of attention connected with the bad mood and the feeling of slowly running time."
Boring can remind you of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a relationship with each other, boring people have a tendency to see the problem like the environment or the world, while people in depression see the problem themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we only have trouble focusing.
In its study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in September in the Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment, where participants listened to a tape on which the person read the article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group didn't hear it at all.
Those who heard the television program quietly announced more boring than the other two groups -- they had problems with focus, but weren't sure why and had these troubles bored.
When you're trying to focus on a difficult or boring task, disturbance may lead to boring, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do something boring, "like looking for bad parts on the factory line, distracting music can help you not be bored."
In fact, he said, we now know that crushing and screwing, which is often seen as a sign of boring, can actually help with boring fighting and keep people physically more careful.
"The research shows that children who are allowed to roll will learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit calm," Professor Fenski said.
We all sometimes experienced boring -- my flight's delay, the sounding reproductor, especially a long-term movie.
But some individuals have more chance to bore themselves than others.
For helping measuring boring, scientists developed "Boredom Proneness Scale" in the 1980s.
The column includes questions like, "All things I have to do, repeat and are monotonous," and "I have so much interests that I don't have time to do them all."
With these degrees, scientists found that the boys have a tendency to bore themselves more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially with regard to the need to have more and different external stimulations.
However, teenagers are generally irregular.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor for human and social development at the University of Illinois, performed an experiment, in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of the teenagers said they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said that he did not know if the percentage of boring would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said that he knows that "adolescent is a high time for boring," which is significantly caused by children and youths is not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is boring for you?"
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to the absurd physical risks, to play gambling games or to use habits as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the relationship between boring and creative, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
"It's a way to tell you that you should do something else," Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology in NYU, said.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing you should do.
If you're bored and use this energy to play guitar and cooking, it'll make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not for a long time.
So if your child's bored and you give him a iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn how to entertain himself or go alone, Professor Fenski said.
And "this separate procedure is transferred from one situation to another," the professor said.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain itself but gain greater self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boring.
But we should not be too critical against her.
Our goal should rather be to feel comfortable when we are from the reach of the continuous drowning of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of the need to bore herself even more, but boring is a painful, calm desire to be connected to something meaningful," he said.
What people actually look for, he said is a way to relax and enjoy a free time.
"In the environment where we're constantly simulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain when noise turns off."
There is no manual in Colorado concerning the new marijuana law
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a student in high school and a footballist from Southeast Colorado, is facing charges from criminal acts for something that will soon be legal throughout the state - for holding several grams of marihuana and chimney that he used to smoke.
Mr. Orozco said that one light day he went with several friends in Lamar, on the plans near the borders with Kansas when he was stopped.
After the policeman found in the car of marihuana, Mr. Orozco was issued a call for holding drugs and equipment for drug use - minor offences for each penalty of 100 USD - and has been given the date of the court.
"They treated us as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In uncertain weeks after Colorad's vote on the legalization of a small quantity of marihuana for recreation depends on the answers of hundreds of smaller drug cases rather in place than on the right.
The hundreds of cases of marijuana offences have already been here and in the State of Washington, which approved similar measures, have been cancelled.
The police department stopped blaming adults at age 21 and elders for holding a small quantity that will be legally permitted after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But the plaintiffs in the Conservative Districts of Colorada declared that they would continue with existing cases of marijuana, and still accuse people of holding.
At the same time, several towns from Denver suburbs vote towards the West Mountains to prevent the opening of new, licensed marijuana trades in their municipalities.
"This matter develops so quickly that I don't know what's going on next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
The heads are talking about the regulators in the state of Washington.
They are looking for instructions about how to set up a system of licenses for production, distribution and sale - all to December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether in good or bad, is first in front of most countries in marijuana regulation, first for medical use and now even for recreation.
"Colorado has a more regulatory market, so he will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman of the Council for License to Sell Alcohol to the State of Washington.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what could work.
"There is no real precedens that we could follow," he said.
The Washington Law, called I-502, is efficiency of December 6th, which also leaves the annual vacuum, during which there will still be no State license system, but legal holding yes.
And there are helled mechanical issues that need to be resolved during this period, for example, how to balance the directive of the State regarding "suitable access" to the licensed marijuana with its ban of rope trade up to 330 meters from schools, parks, children's fields or children's centres.
"Nowhere will be more difficult to place a licensed rope trade than in urban areas, especially in the Seattlu metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, speaker of the Legal Cannabis Centre, recently established research groups.
On November 21, the Chief of Oates sent Oates from the city of Aurora to his officers an e-mail in which he informed them that the city prosecutor will no longer be prosecuting offences for holding a small quantity of marijuana in each citizen aged 21 and that the police "with immediate validity" will stop accusing people of these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police would promote urban laws governing medical marijuana and continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, the district prosecutor Ken Buck presents a stricter view.
After the vote, he declared that his office would continue to pursue marijuana, mostly as a way to push the users to search for treatment.
At present, they are facing a charge of holding 56 grams or less marihuana of 119 people, even though many of them face further charges.
"Our authority is obliged to pursue criminal offences that were criminal offences at the time they had taken place," said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The reaction was also complicated in places such as the village district of Mesa, where the voters rejected the marihuana initiative.
The Grand Junction Police, the largest city of the district, no longer accuses adults of holding a small quantity.
The district prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided not to reject all the ongoing holding cases.
"I don't think I waste my time by continuing promoting law until it changes," he said.
Although 55% of the Colorad voters have supported the measures, bringing marijuana to the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And the opposite reactions across the state have revealed a deep diversity between local officials in view of this large state green experiment.
For the district prosecutors, it is a "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the defendants of the marijuana, and the local speaker of the National Organization for the Reform of Laws relating to marijuana.
"They spent so much of their lives pursuing people that they still can't really accept that it is legal," he said.
As the first states that are constructed to a small quantity of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best way to become national testing cases for drug legalization.
Advocates and state authorities plan new borders for legalised sale and at the same time are concerned to wait for the instructions from the federal government that are still in the plan to consider selling and growing marijuana as federal crimes.
The marihuana legitimacy defenders hope that the Ministry of Justice will be subjected.
In spite of several arrests of marijuana sellers for medical purposes and patients who use it, which have attracted attention, most of the federal government left the medical marijuana trade in Colorado, Washington, and other 16 states in operation.
While the drug agents are probably not going to explode the door to capture a small bag of drugs, it is likely that the State of the regulated marijuana markets permitted by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, former advisor in the field of the Narcotic Administration Policy of President Obama.
Several Colorad cities are not waiting for the procedure of the federal authorities.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved the moratorium for any new marijuana trades, even though it will take about a year before any trade can be opened.
Last week, the Montrose city in the western state proposed a semi-year ban and it is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation when we give a license to someone and then we will have a major federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city Council.
Our community voted against this supplement.
We're looking at what the community voted for, against what the state voted.
There are really many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a conservative."
Not only today's university students are attacked at their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming of a college at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother studied at the university that I thought was the greatest world's village of knowledge, a modern Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
And so far, at the end of the '80s of the twentieth century, by two weeks after I came to Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed baggages, and I arrived in the first scandal of my life.
My father crashed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard says I gave up because I had objections against the love of students in the next room.
The writer A.N. Wilson said that I had left because I was forced to drink from disconnected pellets.
The truth was less comic.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled because I was the subject of systematic scaring and frightening.
Not because of my bizarre name or the fact that I came from private school.
I was persecuted for the only reason, and in this enlightenment colleague, it was both bigogious and barbaric: my father, the dead Woodrow Wyatt, was a highly built advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I were the Conservative Party.
You can ask why I'm pulling it out right now.
Just because the recent reports suggest that a new generation of students on the right of the center suffers similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred against conservative students in Oxford is so large that last week the group of these students have been pursuing the same protection of equal rights as gays, health infections and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College argue that because of their political views, they are "commonly isolated, exposed to personal attacks and are given to them that they are not welcomed".
They request the establishment of a position in the university Committee for Equal Opportunities to ensure that their views are free to be communicated.
Their situation has not been helped by a recent documentary show of BBC Two called Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (Mythical country: young, intelligent and right) about a student political act that the conservatives have been embodied as freaks and non-nazis.
The show was presented by Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (conservative Association of the Oxford University - OUCA), who was riding Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a stick with a silver head.
In other high schools, conservative students say that because of the introduction of a higher school, they are treated as "familiar lambs".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President Nottingham University Conservative Association (Conservative Association of the Nottingham University), said to Sunday newspapers that "left influence in universities is growing.
People think we're like a Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
An 11-year-old history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who stands behind the movement for greater protection, says that such climate is "negative", while the 19-year-old President of OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that access to JCR members to people on the right of the middle has occurred.
"This is a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as for the good living conditions of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I came in in September 1986, 18 - year - old and disgustingly shameful.
The hatred against the Conservative side was the most hot.
A year earlier, the university voted for the rejection of the honorable title of the former student, Margaret Thatcher, for the reasons of the abbreviations in the financing of high school.
From the atmosphere, the steady people would be afraid.
During the first few days of the introduction week, when new students are getting together with the professors, I got to taste the peleas who was supposed to come.
I realized that not only the professors of silence approve the punching of conservative students but also take part in it.
The policy of mining strike, privatization and resistance of the government against the apartheid sanctions in the South African Republic has been introduced to the woods covered by the listeners.
My first lecture was about the translation of the French text from the 18th century to English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Ms. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now dead), "Please translate the first paragraph."
I've been pretty cold.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like a cake cake, was very yellow.
"Thatcher's people refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The rest of the students were hybrid.
My eyes were tears drilling.
"I suggest that in your free time you take some basic lessons of French, that is, unless you are too busy with social matters," said Professor Pittt.
I went back to my room.
At dinner at school, I sat alone when I felt a light knocking on my shoulder.
He was a second anniversary student named James who represented himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said gentlely.
Unfortunately, it is.
Everyone suspected of conservation is a target.
It's bad for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most conservative elements pretend to be labourists.
Later in the local house, I tried to pretend cowardly.
I insisted that I disagree with everything that Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be unsuccessful.
A student of the first year of the philosophy, politics and economy, who (which is ironic) went to Eton, said, "You're a daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
Other students recorded with him.
I was freaked, dirty.
"How do the conservatives love?" one asked.
They're beating each other, aren't they?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel before liberal legislation from the 1960s.
Can I ever have a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet with similar people just after darkness?
Do I have to change into a labourist and push my natural tendencies?
Three years have developed before me as a cleaner of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who was sitting in my faculty.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was Margaret Thatcher's advisor for foreign policy and one of those who wrote her speeches.
He was almost there.
This place he hated for his province and minority and for his tendency to marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he became a professor at the Bilkent University in Turkish Ankara.
"You're not gonna be happy here," he told me.
I started traveling from Oxford to my parents’ house in London, looking for a shelter with my undeployed metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies in Oxford, all political views were adopted in the 40s.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreams.
Even my communist friends always had perfect ways.
His moisture eyes were screwed up.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
I would have broken my heart if you left.
My emotional resistance has been worsened by frequent trips to London.
My friend, also a favorite Conservative Party, was under pressure and gave up his conviction.
The next week during the course of the study, when another professor of history fully seriously declared that I was "the enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even when I was red inside in shame, I confessed that my "parents washed my brain" and I called them "old fools".
The relief was just short-term.
My father smashed my Oxford Carrier's coffin into the coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns every week to Murdoch's paper.
My door was locked.
I cried inside and after five minutes my persecutors gave it up.
When they left, I packed my baggage and caught the first train to London.
I've never come back.
You can call me a crushed weak.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be in the educational institute subject of such intimidation and poisonity.
But even more tragic is that it was Oxford, not only from which 14 conservative prime ministers came from, but also hiding for the undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thinking.
"Valentino prefers elegance than glory."
At the occasion of the "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemish and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, ancient residentiality of Isabella I. English, is the only place in the British capital to host the Valentin Garavanio exhibition.
The designer confirmed it at the beginning of the famous retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which represents more than 130 high-mode models created by his atelier in the past 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unchanging Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of the story in which "or signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not be written without his honorable clients.
Valentino always felt charmed by a rare and remote world of aristocracy.
The first exhibition room, which lasts until March 3th, transmits private correspondence and photos with signs of the most important nobles, from Princess Salimy Aga Chan over the Greek princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino presents these personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: from a simple croiser from the city of Voghera, northern Italy to an idol of international "bohemic garbage".
The love of the royal families is nothing wrong.
"They're at least screwing up a cigarette into a great carpet, like some beautiful pop-music celebrites," says Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemish.
In the 1960s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests have a lot of fun with elegance.
"All of us were very pleased when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife "Heini" Thyssen and a close friend of the forgotten beauty like Marella Agnelli or Eugene Niarchos.
"Valentino always preferred elegance than glory.
And yet he's a star."
Valeria Mazz presents Valentine
The charisma designer doesn't even forget the Argentine model Valeria Mazz.
"It's been a lot of years since we went to him for dinner after a show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were twenty and Sharon Stone and John Kennedy were younger.
In every smallness of his apartment, decoration, food, music, he was radiated in everything and felt his spirit.
All the invitations made it possible to feel important and loving," recalls the top model that started working with him during the Paris week of high-mode in 1995.
"He will never come out of fashion because his proposals are artwork," he ends.
Birthday show
Gravanigo's life is not a story of obsession, but really renewed love.
He loves people with good behavior and better titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries was transferred to a special seventy-foot passage that offers a exchange of roles: the visitor changes into a model and walks the passage to observe the "providence" of dreams that Valentin's master work as dresses that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotel Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti was wearing in "Night", or the coat from the wave and the skin that belonged to the empire, Farah Diba.
In the audience of the models, names such as Sibilla Lucemburska, Gloria from Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norway, Rosario Bulgarian or Sophie Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and Designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino's first love, "can't forget it."
"I remember this perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, vests "gillette" and a jacket from the collection of autumn-winter from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," said Naty Abascal, one of the designer museums.
"I give him the advantage of his femaleness and his great love for women because he undermines our beauty," the former Duchess of Feria adds.
"I like the colors that he uses, they make it clear, and they give "iskra" to the face.
The proportions are perfect."
Even the princess and fashion icon of Patricia della Giovampala d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she dressed Valentina.
When she grew up and lived in Italy, she wanted to be full of age and have an opportunity to dress one of his evening dresses...
Finally, she came to the end of the 1990s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentine to celebrate at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
They were red dresses that had dresses with calls, creamed animals and tops without shoulders.
It was a dream that became the reality," says the widow of Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is lax for fashion, his passion is overtime," explains the Italian aristocrat, whose life is going between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has been stored by the designer's dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a piece of memories they have in them."
"King of Fashion"
The golden stove of the Somerset House are the wedding dresses of Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding with Paul Greek in 1995.
For the creation of these silk dresses, elephant color with all pearls, twelve types of different knots and a train long four and a half meters required four months of work and 25 "girls" (as called designer of his swadlens).
According to Suzy Menkes' journalist, the biggest authority of the specialized press, represents these dresses the top fashion of the late 20th century, the "return of clients from high society".
Valentino lighted over the years of the elite "savoir-eter" is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest celebration in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and awarded by the Order of Honorary Legion accumulates as much honour as any of his client's husbands.
"My attention was always attracted to his choice, peace, a fixed and perfect appearance," Princess d'Arenberg recognizes.
"I last saw him at the gala dinner in the Orsay Museum a month ago.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my big girlfriend.
It was great, time didn't leave a lead on it."
When the princess says that...
The hardest work in the world: carriers in the area of vulture Kawah Ijen
For four euros they gambling carriers in the area of the Indian vulture with their life and health when they tolerate 70 pounds of cheese down the strict stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and they are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wjayi, one of 400 miners who earn for living by winning raw from the Kawah Ijen vulture in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
This is why they have to flour every day to the bottom of the crocker where cheese gases from the inside of the Earth are avoided and, in contact with the air, they move into a solid state.
After cutting the large blocks of raw materials that weigh up to 70 pounds together, he takes them on his shoulder in two bamboo basket along the stone paths.
Toward the top of the leather, which is about 2,386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but it takes more than 40 minutes to exhausted carpets to step up, because they keep their balance and consider their steps carefully not to slip and to fall into the ruin.
They know that any confusion could cost them a life, as it happened to a French tourist who had fallen down from Kawah Ijen rock years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for each kilo of cheese that they pull out
When they are upstairs, they take a trip around tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in the circus, and tiredly carry heavy baskets to the weight that the mine company placed a little below, at an oversea height of 1850 meters.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been weighing since 1960 and has never paid its employees more than 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for a pound of cheese.
He then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to petrochemical industry, because this nestability has its place in daily life and is used to produce spices, entertaining pyrotechics, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to white sugar.
"Because it usually wears 70 pounds, we make about 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) for each trip," Anto explains to us, which usually graduates three ways a day.
One way takes him three hours and at the end is destroyed, but he can make 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) a day.
Although it appears to be a negligible amount for such a non-human effort, it's a triple of what he would make on the field.
"The day's pay is very high here. For example, for the collection of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) per day and the salary for 14 days is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the carrier who used to work on the tourist island of Bali as a waller.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6,2 euros) for the day and work, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwang, the village near the soup, for a serious reason that is as persuasive as the cheese in Indonesia: "I married a young girl from Bali, who is hinduist, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has astma, he breathes badly, he coughs, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At his 27 years, Anto is three times daily risking life in the vulture of Kawah Ijen, whose cheese has already started picking his tax, although his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
My asthma, he breathes badly, he coughs, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases that escape from the vulture.
That's the price he has to pay for to achieve his dream.
"I will work for another two years, because I want to open or study Spanish or French," he promises more than a persistent English.
This sweet and intelligent young man, acquired by fate, could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a reception in the hotel, and instead does the work of the carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden chamber with other carriers and each day he gets up at 2:00 in the morning, because the cheese doesn't stop screwing at night and its characteristic yellow color changes into blue and glowing darkness.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto's flying into the crotter and lighting his way with a little light that he had attached to his helmet and bought it himself for his money.
Approximately 400 carriers carry on the shoulder of the cart with raw from the bottom of the crotter
Although the company has high revenues, it has not limited the saving of raw materials, nor does it provide the own-handed and with such efforts, no equipment.
In fact, they don't even get a share of 30,000 rupies (2.5 euros) from a photo supplement, which together with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) choose the guardians of the natural park from tourists who are coming to photograph the soap and its human mules.
"This work is for cattle, not for people," suggests Madrusin, a solid 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left schools.
He can raise up to 110 pounds and assures us that he can endure to work, "as long as possible," because he needs the money to educate his three sons aged between 18 and 10 years.
I'm not retiring, I'm going to die here because the vulture was my whole life.
Although the cheese burns the throat and slides in the eyes, when the wind unexpectedly turns and catches the miners in the density of the vultures, the miners are so claiming that none of them complains that they suffer from serious diseases... it is obvious from their common respiratory difficulties, artross, knee pain and wounds on the shoulder caused by the weight of the basket.
Unainik, who considers his basket on his back, can only load 50 pounds in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his colleagues are embarrassing 15 tonnes of cheese in the vulture, which then three trucks ride a strict road between the gums to the store in Tamansari, 18 miles away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the vulture was my whole life," Unainik declares and opens up a wide mouth that lacks a few teeth.
Of his five sons, the oldest, the thirty - year - old, he also earns the cheese.
Time passs, but the stone poor of one of the most difficult crafts in the world persists from a generation to a generation - the artists that perform human mules in Kawah Ilen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
Singapurans are scanning that they have no children, career, stress and livelihood costs and education.
"The inhabitants of Singapore need to grow."
I'm married and I'm a patriarch, you're my wife and you're a patriot.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of the advertisement on mental candy, but yet -- or perhaps that's why -- the video in the beginning of this year in Singapore has spread mass widen on YouTube.
These sentences are part of the rape that uses local edges of type "we'll put a bull in the pipe" as a laugh in the rate of birth in Singapore.
The BBH advertising agency that created the video hopes that this advertisement will be able to mention the problem in a funny way.
The artist director of the agency Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the influence of music to fulfil their "civil duty".
"One is exclusively about the Internet, so it must have been fun and fun.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the reproduction of our population, so we felt that it was the subject we had to touch.
We knew that the government was trying a lot of things like expanding perfumes with feromony or organizing listing parties.
Many of these ideas could be creative, but not completely functional.
So we thought about why not do the creativeest possible thing, such as the composition of the rape, so we can solve this problem."
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it very easy is the Singapore government.
He will make $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternal vacation and grants financial doses.
All these measures, however, had a small effect.
Singapore is a rich city state with advanced technologies in the southeast of Asia, also known as the conservation of its representatives and strict social controls.
The rate of birth in Singapore with regard to the classification of the population is at the moment 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate of 2, which is considered to be a renewal rate, in 1976.
Why do Singapore have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Union of Marriage and Family of the National Office for Population, says it is due to "better education" and "the wider scale of career opportunities".
"So people have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, it's not just a wedding and a family," he explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in the number of free people and to postpone marriage and childbirth. The result is the reduction in birth rate in Singapore.
While the immigration policy had attempted to drastically increase the flow of immigrants as measures against the decline in the population, it had caused disagreement among local populations.
On some Singapore websites, there is an un hidden xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese who are criticised for maintaining low salaries and a small effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also considered as one of the reasons why the government party of Singapore last year recorded its worst election result since the beginning of independence.
After elections, a problem of dealing with by quotas and higher fees for foreign workers has occurred.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in birth rate has known impacts on national economic growth, tax revenues, health expenditure and immigration policy, some unexpected consequences have also occurred in Singapore.
The government's trying not to build so little homes.
For example, she began to influence property trade.
The Urban Development Office began to regulate the number of small apartments known as "boot boxes", which may be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have a surface of 46 square meters and have a great success in sales.
However, the concern is that these apartments can support youth lifestyle and distract developers to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the EL Developing Company, claims that their "boxes from shoes" are sold far faster than larger houses.
"They're more popular, and they're selling for days to weeks faster than houses with a larger range.
That's why they're much better for our cash flow."
Nevertheless, he admits that new standards lay out clearer rules to developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could be aimed at increasing the level of birth of the nation, the interview with Singapurs working in the financial quarter in the centre of the city suggests that they will not have a great effect.
"People are still in stress, houses are expensive, as well as education, so many people are delaying it," a young official says.
"Let the rest have children.
But it's important for me to rely on my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old, young man.
Men and women mention career, stress and cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So whatever the government's trying to force citizens to have children, they're still Singapurs who have the last word about the establishment of the family.
What's private offline is private and online
Private.
According to the dictionary issued by the King's Spanish Academy, it is something that has personal nature or "the area of private life which every right to protect against any violations".
What is privacy for a 16-year-old man?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the danger he is exposed to when he publishs matters that he certainly would not tell anyone about normal communications?
The elPeriodico journalists confessed five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years of age who are common Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy as "this is completely own" in personal and "user name and password" if it was social networks.
"My greatest secret would not be published," says a decade-year-old Jorge in trying to explain the importance of privacy in sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"They are very secret secrets, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
"I'm putting nice pictures or photos on the FB as we play.
I'm also talking to my friends there.
I wouldn't share a picture that would not be mine, or a picture that would make someone laugh," he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publicize obscene photographs, photographs of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or to write humiliating or rough comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he's got on FB and nine favorites on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is a mother who has a name and a password of one of the accounts.
"I found an account on Twitter so that I can express my views and write interesting contributions.
I don't know if anyone answers me, I'm just giving them there," he adds.
"Social networks are funny, I can talk to relatives who are far or fast to communicate with friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended someone stranger to him.
The case of the 14 - year - old José is different.
This teenager owns Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask accounts and in the last mentioned network admits that he doesn't know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I'm not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them wanted a address or a phone number after him.
"If they insisted on me or demanded it from me, I will simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José signed up on Ask after he read the Twitter recommendations.
This boy is not an alien experience with what it's called cyberbullying today.
"Known friends were blackmailed on social networks.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who it was," he confirmed.
According to José, the victim didn't sign up on the account.
"Only activated private regime."
Then explains the series of steps how to set the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would have published photos known in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would have done it if someone was disturbing me or just wishing.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and a graduate in the field of education and teaching, believes that children and teenagers in social networks need to understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform them.
He states: "The Internet has emerged as a tool for searching for information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game have changed."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic worker Marc Prensky, a student of education at Yale University and author of the article Digital Natives and digital immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born during this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and we are only learning ourselves," he says.
It explains that it is a complicated theme, "because we ask them to recognize what is appropriate to spread, publicize and say, and what not, when they are not mature."
Also, to be - about the environment - reasonable, at the time what they desire most is to be favorite, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences," he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what is privacy, asking questions that make them think.
"Tell them not to do anything, it doesn't work," he adds.
Furthermore, Marrielos Porras emphasizes some of the options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this online?
Or: Would you like someone to publish your picture as you published a friend?
Do you know what the others say about you?
When you mark people on the photos of celebration, did you ask these people for permission?
And another: do everyone need to know what you're doing all the time?
The next point is to realize that they must be acting in the Internet as outside.
They're the same rules.
"A person is administered outside the Internet with respect, moral and other principles and should be the same on social networks," he says.
Oversight
Estuardo Guarddia, university professor, teacher at first degree, and educational adviser explains that it is necessary that children are carefully read the rules of social networks.
"If he understands every indication, they have a good basis to talk to their children about the consequences that the establishment of an account on the Internet can have.
For example, as regards age or what is allowed to be shared or publiced," he says.
Guardia is the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of a traditional rule "do not talk to strangers."
The South America Summit ends and the Lima Declaration has not been published
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today, without being issued the Declaration from Lima, which was revised and allegedly signed by the seven presidents present.
The Efe Agency has tried to get access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of the heads of the State and governments of Unasur, but the representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidential Office, who at the beginning decided that the document will be published after the summit, indicated that it will be later published on the websites of the Peruan government.
They further stated that the content was published by the Peruan President Ollanta Humala in several short press statements.
The journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the negotiation, a video from the presidential meeting was transferred from the "confidential session, no sound transfer".
A small amount of information available to the journalists was provided by press speakers of some governments that were present, but not by Peruan speakers.
The only document published during the negotiations was the list of the presidents, which caused the absence of hundreds of journalists from the various national and international media that asked for more information.
Later, the Peruan presidential office sent the media e-mail with the "conclusive statement" from the summit, but it is only the expression of President Humala, not the official document that the summit concluded.
Last October hosted Peru's third summit of the South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Paises Arabes, ASPA) and neither at this occasion the originally promised Declaration from Lima was published, although the press was zealously required.
On the official ASPA pages, the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruan authorities have sought to ensure the broadcast for all journalists, but have completely avoided the information.
The summit concluded, inter alia, the joint obligation of Chile and Peru to adopt the judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, addressing the dispute on the border between the two countries.
President Peru Ollant Humala and Chairman of Chile Sebastian Piñera met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in Hague, which will begin on Monday by hearing the defence speech of both parties to discuss a dispute launched by Lima v. Santiagu.
"We will take part and execute a judgment that will solve the dispute that we are discussing in this international court today," said President Humala and his Chile Protest.
"Chile was, it is and will be a country respecting international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts," he supplemented Piñera and welcomed President Humala by hand-sharing on the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that the decision of the International Court of Justice was made public after Columbia adopted the Bogotic Covenant this week, expressing its subjection to the judgments of the international court, which decided on the maritime borders with Nikaragua, and Colombia considered this decision completely wrong.
The summit took place without the participation of the Presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Christina Kirchner).
Paraguay was excluded from Unasur in 2011 after the appeal of the President Fernand Lug, and the meeting was not attended.
The host president Ollanta Humala was authorised to start early talks and finish the summit in Lima shortly afternoon.
The President read the final document in which he informed that 16 agreements were adopted and that activities were planned on 31 projects between South America countries, with $17 billion investments.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR Member States will "do the important steps towards a goal in the form of South America's citizenship, which will extend the residence agreements".
He informed that actions were supported to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organized crime, to improve the availability of medicines and cheap internet in all corners of South America and to common and effective measures against natural disaster risks".
When Europe is in the crisis, "does not have economic consolidation (Latin Americans) a victory, but it is to serve to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to prefer a group of 31 symbolic projects to improve the transport connection of various South America places, especially rural and border areas... to make our countries better connected and create new economic bonds," the Peruian President said in the read speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects relate to Peru and its axes from the coast to Brazil, and the other two relate to better links with Ecuador, but did not give more details.
The final document also touched the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country will serve for its return to the Union of South America" from which it is currently excluded.
Another issue that the summit raised was that Latin America remains a prosperous and peaceful area that is integral and has good neighbourhood relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before he attended a regional meeting that he hoped that he would meet with his Nikaragua Protegian Daniel Ortega on Saturday, with respect to the verdict of the International Court of Justice on the dispute on the maritime boundaries contested by Godota.
"It is possible to meet President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will discuss all solutions, none are excluded, nor a contract with Nikaragua that would require negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope that I can tell the President Orteg to conduct the negotiations as civilized as possible as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega meet in Mexico on Saturday, where the inauguration of the President of Enrique Peñi Neta should be attended.
In the framework of the summit, the EU Ministers of Defence first met to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in the area's defence.
UNASUR members are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay, although the last mentioned country is currently excluded.
Peru is a temporary chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn European integration
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, really must learn from Europe."
Correa, who attended the Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, declared in state TV Peru that the Europeans "have been killed for World War II" and in other conflicts, "but they are practically one country now".
In this regard, the project of the South American Citizenship, which Member States support Unasur, was protected.
"The free movement of citizens and employees within any South America country that is already being held among the members of the Andean Community must be aimed at, however, there are still reverse areas that want to return us back to the past," he noted.
The Ecuador President, inter alia, expressed that he agrees to overcrowd the Organization of American States (OAS) provided that the influence of the English States will be reduced and will be taken into consideration by those who signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
"Those who are in the head are never bound to anything, and we South Americans will sign everything.
It is unacceptable that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is financed in Washington by the United States," he stated in an exemption to the political asylum provided by the Ecuador founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he had not betrayed his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at that time "existed reasonable suspicion that Assange could be issued to a third country, regardless of the process in progress".
Furthermore, he criticised the Swedish justice that asked him to interrogate in the Swedish territory for an alleged sexual delicate, while "the own Swedish legislation allows the interrogation by a video conference call that could be made from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange will have a deterioration of physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since, what is on our embassy, but the Ambassador informed me that he has minor lung problems, but nothing serious," the Ecuador head of the state said.
"But it's threatening that his physical and mental condition will be worse because he's closed in a small space without the possibility of moving on fresh air.
That would mark everyone's health," he added.
The President Correa noted that the solution to asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuador Embassy in London on the basis of a permit that allows him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks were held with London in order to settle WikiLeaks' imprisonment.
"We do not negotiate on human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but interviews have been continuing.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón leads a series of management in various European instances," he said.
He said, "If Britain issues a pass tomorrow, it's all over."
And if Sweden hears Mr Assange at the Ecuador Embassy in London or through Skype, how it allows therein legislation and as it has been done in other cases, it will be done tomorrow."
Correa used this situation to represent himself as a defender of freedom of press, and explained that he definitely does not tolerate "subsensitiveness, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
The biggest enemies of free press are not us, cruel and disgusting politicians, but the bad journalists in the services of profits, pressures and extortion," he said.
In this regard, he expressed joy about the fact that neither such journalists, nor bankers nor hegemon countries nor burgioazy control Ecuador," and said that if he is re-elected, "he will continue to change in the right way and in the right direction."
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain the veto expressed by Paraguaya on membership in Unasur's Union at least to its next elections and argued that the total "must be firm and not tolerate oportunism and pucism covered in legality" because he actually "destroyed the legitimacy of paraguay democracy".
The Ecuador President also stated that he considers "perfect" the wish of his colombian prott Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nikaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, at the time after the judgment of the International Court in Hague, which decided in favour of Nikaragua.
The judgment is currently not accepted.
"The problem is between the South America and the Mediterranean country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by willing to walk together.
They must be judged wide to be overcome and be able to go forward."
He also expressed his hope in comparison with the marine border, which deals with the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek an international instance, if both countries are committed to accepting a judgment, whatever hard it is".
With regard to the possibility that he will be running in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to be held in order for the third mandate, he noted that he has seen this option "with great optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa declared that if the election loses in February 2013, he will leave public life.
"I have never personally been interested in much, but the unfair situation, such as the social economic poverty in Ecuador, can only be fixed by political power.
My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this probably victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I won, it would be my last presidential period and then I would leave politics.
If we lose, I'm waiting for the same thing.
I have already made my decision," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new health treatment of Venezuela President Huga Chaveza in Cuba.
"I have just spoken to Venezuela Vice-President Nicolas Madur, who says that President Chavez went to a planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign was completed.
It's not a recycling in the president's health status," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian State has today participated in the sixth summit of the heads of the state and governments of the Union of South America (Unasur), which was completed by challenges for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
Victims of AIDS are the result of late diagnosis today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was like a lightning hit me," he tells at the memories of the moment of truth that the doctor tried to "slow down a little bit," but obviously without success.
A boy secreted it from his family.
He decided to take his illness himself on his boots and start informing himself about it, with such a embarrassment that he already celebrated his 43th birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the most recent HIV units in the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he arrived in 1994 after several disease fights.
Fabrizio lives with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since 22 years, which was something unbelievable in the beginning of the 1990s, where there were many doubts, few treatment possibilities and greater stigma.
The director of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) did not say goodbye to him then, "because he had a cutting wound."
Then having AIDS was a synonym of death.
Now it's possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are many people who do not know and lose about their disease until the virus caused the destruction of the organism and expanded the immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since AIDS has occurred in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "is a great success that the length of life of a patient who starts with treatment in time and in a proper way is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, with the confirmation of this information in April this year in prestigious scientific publication.
Infector and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and full life depends on the degree of immune system of patients with disease diagnosticated, and that people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and 500 CD4 to 50 years.
Simplely speaking this means that the one who is diagnosed with HIV at 25 years of age can “live without problems until 75 years of age, ” explained the doctor in the interview.
To emphasize this progress, it is appropriate to recall that the average life length of Mexicans is 76 years now.
Although mortality has decreased significantly over the past years and in Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS decreased, from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (the UN Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS-UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients have died from the national statistics.
Only in Jalisco died in 2011 255 people and until this May 187. However, from 2005, universal access to antiretrovirotics is provided.
Why are people still dying for the consequences of the disease?
- "The problem doesn't seem to be in the way of treatment.
That's how I see it. That's how it happens in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we haven't exhausted the drug supply; the problem is that patients are coming in a very advanced stage because they don't know the condition of the disease, or at the late stage of the disease."
He adds a convincing state: "Devety of ten patients are coming when any associated infection is already manifested. The only thing that we need to do is to influence the total mortality is to diagnose the disease before, and therefore it is highly necessary to offer tests for the detection of the disease to all those who ask for them."
In his proposal, specialists and officials from the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco and directly with such patients as Fabrizio, who came to allow the tests to the private lab only because his friend did it, and despite his low age, he had already suffered from AIDS disease, and also suffered from Kaposi's sarkoma, a tumor disease, which is one of the common complications.
"All changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm supposed to die, I'd rather get rid of myself three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was to better, healthy eating, practicing, taking medication."
His parents still know only that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone.
I work, I have a lot of activity, I travel, I lead an active sexual life, but responsiblely, I look after myself and the other person," the Fabrizio emphasizes who accepted the call to share his experience with the MILENIO JALISCO journal to motivate those who are afraid to witness today within the World Day of AIDS.
"Let's let them do their tests, if they're risking, whatever they know as soon as possible, if they're HIV positive, it's better, and if they're already diagnosticated, they'll realize that they can live like anyone else when they're responsible."
This message summarizes the password of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the desktop
Among the health and ordinary citizens is a huge ruin, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajarian journalist who is investigating the HIV virus information.
And the biggest spaces are in prevention.
In places that are devoted to this task, "really increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, they give us a hundred condoms today, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most inclined to new diseases are teenagers.
"What do you want?" is a common question full of ironia and assessment from social workers, school advisors, pharmacists and health personnel who are trying to avoid, says the reporter.
He proposed this ineffective division to change. Let the condoms not just be behind the pulses, but let them be in the dosing rooms in public toilets, in places where young people often go.
"It's not supporting promiscuity.
It's not even about "paying beer and motel", as Governor Emilio Gonzalez responded to the question whether he would agree to divide condoms in his district.
It's not such sexuality. It's best to access condoms to those who have already led sex life," he noted.
Key numbers in Jalisco
13,435 cases were recorded (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV).
This state means a fourth place in Mexico in new and detected cases of AIDS and the 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of the infection is conducted sexually, 6% in the blood path y 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV, because four to five people are not aware of the disease.
The judgment approved by the United States Court of Appeal, which does not recognise the restructuring of the debt of the Group of Vitro established by a competition in Mexico, calls for a mild precedent for any national company with branch offices in the neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
Therefore, the restructuring procedures for companies that allow mexican laws seem not to apply in the country of strips and stars despite international agreements.
The approval of the judgment issued last June by Judge Harlin Hal at the North Texas Contest Court leaves the Mexican company in practice without defence against the possibility of confiscating their property on the second coast of the el Bravo River.
However, the judgment opens the main Mexican producer of glass doors to the United States Supreme Court with a appeal against three disagreements.
The introduction should be said that while the judge of this cause claims that the creditors should be followed by the United States insolvency law, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth District with the residence in New Orleans states that the main procedure establishes an audience procedure in Mexico.
First, this would indicate the lack of international process cooperation in cases of insolvency of cross-border enterprises.
For this purpose, a model law of the United Nations was established to unify international trade law, which is a arbitral organization of the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment determines that, without a vote of offices from the internal business structure, where the debt of Vitro is recognised against the branches, the required majority of restructuring would not be achieved.
Nevertheless, this option is permitted by Mexican laws.
The fact is that the Vitro case was not the first time in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples such as Agremex and Comercial Mexican, whose internal debts were guaranteed by the Federal Competition Institute.
Furthermore, it is true that even after the recruitment of the branch branch votes, the creditors - who were against Vitro in the United States court, i.e. the funds of "sups", such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited - did not reach the majority.
In the vote, about 45 percent would reach 37.
The Court of Justice does not take this in question.
From another point of view, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation facing since 2008 - on the background of a serious economic crisis that hit the United States.
Meanwhile, the family company of Gonzaleze Sady will appeal to a new assessment directly at the appeal court to carry out the review in full participation, that is, by the participation of five judges, because they originally voted only three.
If he fails here, he will require as a corrective means to revise the process with higher instances, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
In the case, it is important that the Court referred to the document sent by the Mexican Government as a form of amicus curiae, which detailed the procedure of Vitro under the Competitive Law, and pointed out that the company has facilitated its commitment to agreements signed by the two countries to confront the law with Chapter 15 of the Insolvency Law of the United States.
Furthermore, it points out that the country was subject to the principles of the United Nations for International Trade, this is the rules for international insolvency cases which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Infarction on both sides: punishment for Vitro and State.
Total assessment
Without prejudice, the criminal notification of the mexican aircraft committees against the former owner of the Gaston Azcarrag Andrade, who was charged with a deceptive negotiation, has already expired.
The instance led by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morineau has just filed a complaint against the National Banking Commission and the commission for securities accused of the obstructions in reaching justice.
According to it, the control authority systematically refused to report to the Public Prosecutor General on the transaction carried out by this entrepreneur, where IXE from the Fideicomis F/589 has chosen on behalf of the Mexican Airport 198 million pesos.
Professional hotel management (Administrator Professional de Hoteles) has probably been directed to buy stocks.
As we know, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Surrounding Dragon Martu
In the Universidad de Caribbe area, a group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academists, businessmen, and ordinary citizens who approved the creation of the association to prevent the opening of Chinese Dragon Marta in Kankun.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge trading and distribution centre with products from "the country with large walls" aimed at Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential zone for 150 employees.
The organization of Canacintra (Camara National de la Industria de Transformationion) has already been able to unify the governors of the southeastern zone to stand against a monumental area that partly destroys the protected areas and represents the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of the ACTA document
The request of the Senate which the government did not take into consideration and which required explanation under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador in Japan signed the Trade Anti-False Agreement known under the English shortcut of ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industries (Instituto Mexico de la Propeidad Industial) deprived the reality.
As we know, it happened so much despite the possibility of the Senate itself to view it as a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in long-term horizont
In an effort to pay long-term debts and not to influence those short-terms the Homex developer's company market investment certificates for 500 million pesos.
This series is the first of the four identical ones that offer interest payments every 28 days.
Competitive Born
By connecting the front companies in information technologies such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, a communion with a commercial name Competival was born, aimed at the market of software services in Central and South America.
Investments in business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The Hector "Hetin" Reyes basketball player was connected to this Hall for over 60 years and processed the whole world through it.
Many people in Puerto Rico have so many memories of the history of local basketball like Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was before in 2008 a stroke on a wheel chair, burned into this sport for over 60 years, whether as a player of younger categories, a national basketball league of BSN, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the national basketball liaison, or the President of the Portory Basketball Federation.
"I took a lot of roles during my life in basketball, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the National League of BSN in the 1990s, the General Director of the National Team and the President of the Federation," Reyes recalled when Reyes visited journalists Primera Hora at his home in Bayamon, where he lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't overcome his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated by photos and reminder objects from his long career, testify.
Bayamón in Heart
With the greatest embarrassment from all guards, those who remind his impact in Los Vaqueros since the mid-50s, where he was a player until 1982, where he also celebrated 15 years as a companion or owner of the team.
"That was my best years, that I enjoyed most because I had an opportunity to join the LA team since 1967 to participate in eight championships, whether as owner, colleague, or trainer.
It was a series of successful years, including five champions held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one champion in 1981, when Jerome Mincy debuted in BSN.
Then the team took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," said Reyes.
"I remember that Gene Bartow, who used to be a coach here at the Alabam University in Birmingham, said to me, "I have a grown two-foot player for you.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Then Bartow recommended me to play Raymond Gaussey, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy brings Bayamon a victory at the championship, then Gauss will contribute to another."
The Championship, when Los Vaqueros played Gausse for the team, enjoyed, but only on the distance, because in 1988 he had already served as President of the Basketball Federation.
At that time, he wanted to fully devote himself to his functions and enjoy Mincy's location at the national team.
"I remember the first time we defeated the United States in the qualifying Olympic match in Mexico in 1989.
Then the world's championship arrived in 1990, where we ended the quarter, but we should have a bronze not to be the Canadian judge who let us repeat the final shopping," Reyes said.
Is the man from the world's championship in 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
It's among the best, just like the one who defeated Dream Team on Olympiada in 2004.
But my favorite was a national team in the Panameric Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we blew out the United States' men that was quite similar to the bronze that pushed us to the world's championship.
The men had not only Mincy, Gaussey, Ramona Rivase, Fica Lopeze and "Pyculina" (Ortiz), but also the young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colon and James Carter, the brothers of Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quiote" Morales, who couldn't be on the team in 1990 for the injury of the knee.
A man who may not have had a perfect composition but was able to win the gold medal and bring great joy was a man from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in Argentine Neuquen.
With players on a surveillance, such as "Canito" Neves, Pablo Alice and the junior player Rolando Hourruitiner who replaced the players excluded for the fight in the Panameric games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all the predictions.
What was the best Puerto Rica player?
It was no doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved such results as Piculin at this level.
Not to mention his actions in different leagues where he played.
Who was the best coach in Portorice?
That's very difficult.
We had a very good generation that belonged to Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arilla's work.
What is your success in the Federation?
That I was part of the most famous era of national men in 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990s, the National League of BSN had up to 17 men in one season.
What didn't you get to prove?
There were things I wanted to do, like the division of youth categories according to regions.
For example, that Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in national play-off.
Now children travel a lot and play too much games, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefits in the mandatory certificates and courses for coaches, assistants of judges and judges.
It's nice to meet you.
What are you dedicating to now?
I'm listening to music mostly, watching YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoying my grandchildren, and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And of course I enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, who was always on my side.
Actor Larry Hagman died
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, celebrated the world's main role of John Ross Ewing, more known as "J.R." in the Dallas TV series, in which he fleshed a man who acted insensitively and manipulating.
Larry Hagman, whose role of a wooden oil magnate J.R. Ewinga in the Dallas TV show became a symbol of hunger in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. in the new Dallas series this year, died in accordance with the official family notification provided by the Associated Press producer company Dallas Warner Bros. on Friday afternoon for complications related to cancer.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown Dallas, where he was again playing the iconic role he liked," his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas on Thanksgiving Day.
"Linda Gray, who was a representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman at the moment he died in Dallas' hospital," said her agent Jeffrey Lane.
He made the joy of everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, nice, kind and talented, and I would miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life in full," Linda Gray said in the notice.
Hagman’s diagnosed liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he himself admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, he was found in the liver, and Hagman was subject to transplantation.
Years before the series Dallas show, Hagman celebrated on TV as a decent guy in a reluctant comedy I Dream of Jeannie emitted by NBC station from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the figure of Captain Tony Nelson, astronaut whose life will change when he meets a attractive girl (gina) played by Barbara Eden, and took her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedies, which were only transmitted shortly, the Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His performance in films included the roles that were well accepted by criticis: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was until Hangman's mastership in the form of an incredibly disgusting J.R. who led him to the startop.
The dramatic series of CBS station on the Ewing clan and other individuals around them was broadcasted from April 1978 to May 1991.
The propaganda slogan "Who shot Jaara?" which was supposed to cause expectations on the full of emotions, when Hangman's character was almost murdered, caused not only a huge number of speculations of the audiences around the world but also the risk of millions of dollars in the salary offices.
This also helped to achieve the record in monitoring.
The November 1980 part, in which the answer was discovered, was watched in the average 41 million television watchers. Dallas became the second most follow-up entertainment show of history after the end of the MASH series in 1983, which watched 50 million viewers.
On J.R., his screwed Christin (which Mary Crosby played).
Christine and J.R. got pregnant and then he threatened her to be a prostitute if she didn't leave town. But there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewinga, an unsaturated chamtizer with charismatic smile: a true entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried to make his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was alcoholic, locked in the hospital.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the grave stone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be, "There's a honourable citizen of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing he didn't do.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone who was "awesome on the platno and beyond."
It is unforgettable and unreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who had the luck to meet him and love him.
Ten parts of the Dallas new series sent the TNT station a few months ago with great success.
"The film of five parts of the second row has already been completed and the sixth has just been rotated," television station informed.
There were no statements from Warner or from the TNT station on how the series will continue.
A cousin from Fort Worth in Texas was the son of an actress and singing Mary Martin, who shineed in classic works such as South Pacific music and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when in 1931 she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, Ben Hagman's lawyer.
In the early 50 ’ s, Larry experienced happiness at the theatre scenes in New York, and then from 1952 to 1956 he served in England at aircraft.
There he met a young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and long lived in Malibu, California, where there were many celebrities.
In 2001 he issued a autobiographic book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't give there anything that I knew could hurt someone or harm him," he said to the agency Prensa Asociad.
After the transplantation of the liver, he began to advocate organ donation and work as a volunteer in the hospital where he helped combat patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense of "Do not worry, it'll be a little embarrassing, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an activeist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Starts a course that explores "the end of the world"
Every week, students are studying apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When Stuart Charmé's professor of religion decided that this semester would make a course about the end of the world, he knew it was an unbearable attraction: At the end of the "long number" of the Mayan calendar, which was to come on December 21st, many people were caught as evidence that the end of the world is coming.
Charmé, however, had no idea what he was waiting for in several months: The catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the budgetary failure, which some call "Long Armageddon", and the growing conflict in which Israel is involved, is the place in which Christians teoretized about the end of the world begins the Apocalypse.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most pocalyptical semester he was ever," Charmé said this week to the students of the Rutgers University in Camden in New Jersey.
When a person discusses what is going on in the world today, as if we had 30 days left, it is a really good time.
And remember that bad means to the apocalyptic thought of good.
And it's not the only professor who offers courses about the end of the world in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At the Temple University, an expert assistant Barry Vacker is conducting the course "Measures, culture and the end of the world".
Every week, students are studying apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We understand why these thoughts are spreading through time," he says, and how hypothetical scenarios are offered, which runs certain human behaviour.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, war can explode.
This month, students are analyzing apocalyptic films and studying how different they are from examples of real life.
"I tried to inform my students about what is possible, probably, convincing and impossible," says Vacker.
At the main campus, the State University of Pennsylvania, the Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solariová, a professional assistant in the history of art and antropology to organize a course with a simple name the end of the world.
"We don't attach "2012", because we always count on the possibility to redeploy the course again in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
In spite of the "threatening destruction" students must study, create projects and make final tests.
In Penn State, the final test will take place at the evening of the Apocalypse, which does not give students a different option than to work "to the evening of the predicted end of the world," Restall said.
The courses have become quite popular.
"He stretched up in two hours," said Restall about his course for students with a high average, who signed up for 35.
Weeks and weeks before the semester, we were getting an e-mail question if there was still a place.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to make themselves comfortable," said at the University of Rutgers in Camden, 23, Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield in New Jersey.
So the apocalyptic, worldly or religious thinking is just a question of comfort or absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old student of psychology and medical care, said he saw all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of an hour in which it could be taught," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no confessed student, since the professor, said he believed in the end of December 21st.
"Our first project was discussed by the Mayan predictions and we're pushing it out in a certain way," said Julie Zeglenov, 21-year-old student at the Temple University of West Chester.
"The Mayans have never foretold the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar," said Restall.
But he added that in the Western culture there is an apocalyptic anxiety that touches a few centuries ago, which people respond to changes in their environment by prophecies about the end of the world.
The flower of these speculations caused the Internet.
"The other place people don't think of it," he said.
It happens in a total majority in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who presents this year at the Philippines, asked if he knew about a course about the end of the world, he answered quickly.
"The Philippines are not participating in the end of the world," he wrote and appointed an exception to the highest office.
We have mercy from the Pope.
Restall noted that during the years, many days of the last court were spoken, and he said that if nothing happens on December 21st, "the people will begin to think immediately about the next date" or to philosophy that 21 December is the beginning of the seven-year period at which the world will disappear.
The date takes a light weight of students and professors.
Several said they were intending to go to "the end of the world".
"I may call a few friends to laugh together," explained a 20-year-old Samira Ford communication student.
