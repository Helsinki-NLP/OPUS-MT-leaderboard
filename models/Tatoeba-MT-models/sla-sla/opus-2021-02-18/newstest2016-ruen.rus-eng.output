The social map of the inhabitant of the Ivanov area is recognized as an electronic payment.
Changes include preservation of benefits for travel in public passenger transport.
As of 24 September, the order of civilians has changed with the use of the social map of the inhabitant of the Ivanov area.
According to the press service of the Russian Government on the Ivanov field, changes provide for the preservation of privileges to travel in public passenger transport and provide a social map intercalculation scheme in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 of the FZ “O national payment system”.
The social map of the inhabitant of the Ivanov area is then recognized as an electronic payment.
Consequently, the conditions of its application are changing.
Thus, the completion limit is now set not in travels as before, but in the amount of money, with winter and summer storage, with a winter of not more than 400 rubles, not more than 800 rubles per month in the summer period.
Currently, the social cards of transport credit cards will need to be monitored not the number of remaining travels, but the remainder of the funds.
The value of a leisure travel for citizens will be 1/2 of the carrier's tariff.
The remaining half of the cost of the travel is reimbursed by the area budget.
The timetable for the completion of the social map remains in cash - between 24 numbers of the previous month and 23 numbers of the current month.
A number of advantages will have a new order of travel on the social map.
Thus, a detailed account of the expense of money on the social map is available with precise precision to coins.
Furthermore, there is a possibility of returning funded but undue money.
Furthermore, the intercalculation scheme with the carriers becomes transparent, as the citizen is now paying half the cost of the travel, and the same amount reimburses the budget of the carrier.
No commission will be taken on the cash map.
In turn, Vasili Sylkin, Deputy Chief of the Department of Road and Transport of the Ivanov area, reported that more than 33 million travels in the region had been carried out in 2015 by using the social map, nearly 25 million travels.
Over 470 million rubles are provided in the area budget for the facilitation of civilian travel with the use of the social map.
As at 1 September, the reimbursement amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
During the 911 call, the teacher is acknowledged in the murder of a friend
During the 911 call, the teacher of Shannon Lamb told the police that he shot his friend and that he needed staff to come home.
Lamb emphasized that there's a dog in the house who's alive, but he's probably upset, and said that the contacts of the family of the dead can be found in her phone.
Inside the house, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note that was not carefully written on the white leaf of the lining paper: "I wish I had wished to bring it back, I loved Amy, and she was the only woman who ever loved me," said the note, according to the representatives of the authorities signed by the Lamb.
Nothing pointed out that Lamb, who was running two online courses at the Delta University of Cleveland, Mississippi, was able to travel 300 miles to the university camp, where he believed that he shot all the respected teacher of history of Ethan Schmidt at the threshold of his office.
The head of the police of the State University of Delta Lynn Baford reported that the university officers learned about shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made the real call at 911 shortly after that.
At the end of the day of the victims, Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The next day, after the shooting at the school school forced students and teachers to hide behind the locked door, the authorities still tried to put the motives of Lamba in one picture.
Information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew it helped to draw a portrait of a talented but perhaps anxious teacher.
Students told me they were looking forward to his classes.
The Hotia police, where Prentiss died, reported that there were no charges for violence or criminal cases.
Sam Schmidt included Lamba in the book he wrote, in which he expressed his appreciation for the “beautiful people ” with whom he intersected in his teaching life.
They both taught at the social science and history faculty of 17 teachers, and many students attended the lectures of both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for a problem.
One student who spoke well about Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said that he was also nervous and anxious, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, told him that Lamb told him how he fought stress at the end of the year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta University to give him a sick leave, saying that he had some health problems.
This year he was only teaching at two online courses.
Recent changes in the university rules of recruitment meant that the degree of the doctor who was so urged to receive Lamb would not guarantee him the automatic receipt of the teacher's post.
The president of the University, William Laforge, told him that he had no knowledge of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course Mr. Lamb had something on mind."
These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
The police attacked Lamb after his escape from campus when he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb was shot from a rear-boot gun of 38 calibers at the back of the house, a mile south of his parents' house in Greenville, Mississippi, reported the coroner of the Washington Métel Johnson district.
His engine vehicle was still standing on the road.
It was immediately irregular why Lamb arrived in this house, though, according to Johnson, she believes that he knew the people living in it.
Lamb grew up in those lands.
Lamb began to work at a university with 3,500 students in the city with about 12,000, in 2009 teaching geography and education.
He received a doctor of educational sciences in the spring of the same year.
One of the old friends of Lamba described him as a smart, charismatic and joyful man.
Carla Hairston told me she was 15 and Lambo 20 years old when they met through common friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool older guy who's been trying to teach her to play a guitar for a few years.
In those years, he enjoyed success in women.
All the girls were sneaking when he was around," said Heirston, who is now 40 and lives in Jackson, the Brandon City.
Lamb and Prentiss were probably meeting for a while.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there's no record of their marriage registration.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the Gothia circular house, whose reverse side was coming to the channel.
According to the police, the dog is fine.
Prentiss' former husband, Sean O'Stin, reported that they were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they had a daughter now 19 years old.
"She's totally depressed," O'Stin said about his daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't see Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were both at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together at concerts.
O'Stin told me his daughter was writing music and singing.
Prentis was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Schaffer, a bartender, and jointly a coordinator of entertainment programmes in the the Julep Room in the suburb of Gottie, said that the last time he saw Lamba and Prentiss on 5 September, when Lamb ended playing guitar and lipshore for few visitors.
Nothing suspicious was observed.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We had fun and jokes over each other.
I mean, they were both very clever.
Schmidt, a dead teacher, had workshops for first-class and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and Colonial America, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher in the same educational establishment.
He was married and he had three little children.
He studied at the University of Kansas, Emporia, and was president of the student brotherhood and student self-government.
At the University of Delta in Cleveland on Tuesday, about 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and members of the community, participated in the memorial ceremony of candle burning.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a ceremony during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The classes will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," said Laforge.
The crisis is over.
It's the day of healing.
Amy and Rohelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was helped by the authors of Associated Press Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with the police statement that Lamba had received 911 call after Shmidt was murdered and that, while Lamb had spoken of Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire less staff for the holiday season
Toys R Us reports that it will not hire as much staff as last year, while the toys and goods for children are assured that it will provide staff and temporary staff with more hours to work.
The company reports that it plans to hire 40,000 people for work in shops and on top bases across the country, that less than 45,000 who were hired for the holiday season 2014.
Most jobs will be partially employed.
The company reported that it would begin interviews with the pretendents this month and would increase staff from October to December.
Although until the holidays are a few months, the purchase season is closer, and companies are preparing for temporary staff to have enough states in shops and on sale, shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is kidding about "the date" with Princess Diana.
The Prime Minister of the "Return to the Future" film was a great event for Michael J. Fox.
It was also noted for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the cinema and waiting for the arrival of the royal family, and I noticed that the place next to me was free, and I was loosely sitting next to Princess Diana," he said in the trailer that was coming up to the documentary film "Return in time."
The movie starts, and I think I'm literally on the distance of my hands and in one false zuff from a date with Princess of Welsh.
"Return in time" -- a documentary film on the "Return to the Future" -- includes an interview with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zekekis and executive producer Steven Spilberg.
The Prime Minister of the "Return to the Future" film took place 30 years ago.
"For me," says Spielberg, "it is, certainly, the greatest movie of travel in time that has ever been taken off."
Back in Time will be available on VOD, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
UN head states that there is no military decision in Syria
The Secretary-General Pan Gi Moon reiterates Russia's military support for Syria that for the nearly fifty-year conflict, there is no military solution, and the increase of arms will only reduce violence and suffering for millions.
The head of UN again called upon all participants, including the divided Security Council, to join and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Mr. Gi Moon stated at the press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with the Foreign Ministers of the Five Permanent members of the Council - United States, Russia, China, Britain and France during the ministerial session of the General Assembly in this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the disagreements in the Council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, have “produced the situation unresolved”.
Mr. Gi Moon called for five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity they demonstrated in the resolution of the nuclear programme on Iran and in the consideration of the Syrian crisis.
8 results of the survey showing that Donald Trump is not joking.
Some tried to put the provoker's label on it.
Others got away from him, considering it a joke.
And some call for a scandal.
However, as some republicans try to whisper the high position of Donald Tramp as a result of surveys, they have failed (bye).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have shown the advantage of Donald Tramp in bi-digits, and some begin to ask seriously what this means to the real estate magnet from the perspective of the chances of acquiring nomination.
Of course, it's just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Tramp has a chance to be nominated by the Republican Party.
The experts pointed out that in 2011, Rick Perry declined his precedence to the popularity of Germany Cain, none of which conquered and one State in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in universal elections.
However, external groups, such as "Supercommittee of Political Activity" Jeb Bush and the Economic Conservative Group of the Growth Club, recognise Tramp's unslashing power and start delivering their dollars to distort it.
Here are some numbers of surveys that say that the real estate magnet is not just a intermediate phase:
Tramp's sympathy ratings turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in the middle of June, the Monmouth university survey showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive view of this magnet in real estate.
By mid-July, it was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Six of the 10 Republicans are now positively referring to Donald Tramp.
Approximately three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these indicators are in the initial stages.
The Quinnipiac survey in Iowa last week revealed that 60 per cent of the Republicans were in favour of Tramp.
Two thirds of the voters for the GOP would have put Tramp as a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans said they either treated " excitement" or "happiness" if Tramp had become a candidate.
Only two of the 10 say they'd be upset if he had become a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates an approximately the same enthusiasm as Tramp (43 per cent say they would be "happy" against 40 per cent of those who say the same to Tramp).
The next level of excitement?
Marco Rubio, who only has 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republicans said they would be "no satisfied" or "but distressed" if the Jeb Bush fan would become a candidate.
Most Republicans do not consider Tramp temperament a problem.
While Trampa is massively criticized for its gratitude and insults, 52 per cent of the voters all over the country believe that the magnet has a proper temperament to be president, as shown in the ABC News/Washington post survey on Monday.
The same figure is characterized in the first closed meeting in Iowa, where 52 per cent of the Republicans think that he has the same person who may be the chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 per cent believe that he is not the person who can be effective at post, and almost six of the 10 independent voters say that his temperament is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post reports.
The Republicans are used to this thought.
When they wear their hats, the republican voters think Tramp is serious.
On the question who was the most likely winner in the GOP nomination, four of the 10 said that Tramp was a favorite, according to the CNN/ORC survey last week.
That's not when four of the 10 were put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full explanation: GOP voters had no proper magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while 28 per cent supported the possible candidate of Mitta Romney.
Nevertheless, this shows that many GOP voters consider Tramp's campaign to be persuasive.
Even if the Republicans were united around another candidate, Tramp was still ahead of all others.
Some experts pointed out that the displacement was likely to play the advantage of the Tramp, while the non-supporters of the Tramp were equally distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
However, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth at the beginning of September indicates that in the hypothetical competition, the "one per one" between Tramp and most other candidates of the Republicans, Trump almost always receives support for the majority.
He's chasing Carly Fiorino at 13 points, Mark Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Cassic and Chris Christ at 33 points.
He's got nothing to do with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate that's around him?
Ben Carson had a 19-point businessman in the hypothetical competition "one per one".
More than half of Donald Tramp's members say they've changed their minds.
The new CBS/NYT survey, held on Tuesday, shows that only more than half of the voters support Tramp, said they were confident in their votes.
Obviously, many things can happen and change the situation, and no one really can say that he will never change his mind.
46 per cent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
Nevertheless, the most tense competition in Tramp at this time is with a colleague from an outside surgeon, Ben Carson, but the voters who say they've changed their minds will probably choose Tramp.
Six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Tramp about immigration.
Since Donald Tramp two months ago called the immigrants from Mexico “violents” in his campaign opening, the theme of immigration has become the most relevant in the talks in 2016.
Some are concerned that the Pozer Tramp will distract the key voters of Latin American origin from the Republican Party and prevent rebranding.
But according to the ABC/Post survey on Monday, six of the 10 Republicans said they agreed with Tramp on immigration.
So while immigration attracts general attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
The Government's disappointment is new.
Donald Tramp and Ben Carson now rely on support from approximately half the Republican voters, mainly due to their status of outsiders.
Six of the 10 Republicans on Monday's new ABC/Post survey claimed that they prefer a political outsider rather than a person with a government experience.
And they are also insulted at Washington.
Research of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa, held two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were disappointed by the activities of the Republicans in the Congress, with 54 per cent " unsatisfactory" and 21 per cent "in anger".
The Government will decide the fate of the pension indexing in October.
The Vice-Prime Minister of RF Olga Hungarac stated that the Government is currently looking for options for the implementation of the pension indexing law in 2016 to the real level of inflation, transmitted by the RG.
She noted that the decision should be found by 8 October, until the draft budget was introduced to the Government for the next year.
Furthermore, the cabin discusses the option of prolonging the decision on the freezing of Russian acquisition.
The hunger noted that the retirement accumulation amounted to 350 billion rubles.
Approximately the same amount is the total pension indexing for the next year.
According to the Vice-Prime Minister, there is still no final decision on who should pay contributions for unemployed citizens.
The hunger believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not apply to socially unprotected categories of citizens, it is not fair to pay for it by society.
The media had previously reported that the cab was considering two options for schematic balance.
Why are the eternals often irritated and red?
The physician-oftalmologist Tatiana Levasova answered:
Our centuries are broads that protect the eye apple from a number of small particles that are sitting on them.
When we forget the regular cleaning of the century, we often contribute to the development of blefaritis.
Simple exit:
Don't shake your eyes with dirty hands, wear with you a special wet wax for a century;
No less than 1-2 times a day, clean up the end of the century from the injured substances in them for the day of harmful substances.
Cleaning procedures are not sufficient to complement warm compressions with heating grass (shalphea, romashes), burning the thick secret of salt irons and then massage of the edges of the century, which should be carried out by the circular movements of the finger pillows;
Do not use alcoholic means by washing your makeup.
They dry and distract the skin and contribute to a further density of the secret of salt irons.
Phenyan claims that Korean nuclear nukes have created a nuclear warhead.
North Korea's authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country, the nuclear complex in Yonbane, is working "for full power".
The report appeared on the web site of the Central Telegraph Agency.
It is noted that the CNDR is ready at any time to respond to “aggression and nuclear threat” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons, both by quantity and quality.
The latest test of nuclear weapons was conducted by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
The plans for resuming the full work of the reactor have not been reported since then.
Phenyan claims he was able to create a nuclear warhead.
Furthermore, the CNDR has tested medium and low distance missiles, says polit.ru.
Girinovski demanded to remove from the Russian hymne the mention of the brotherly peoples.
The Leader of LDPR, Vladimir Girinovski, believes that the name of the Brother's Union should be removed from the national hymn.
He announced this during the meeting of the State, reporting " The Russian News Service " .
Who are these people now?
Fascists and killers!
"A very long hymn, the longest in the world, even the sportsmen can't stand," said Girinovski.
The Deputy believes that all the fourth ones in which this line is contained should be removed:
In the summer of 2014, Girinovski stated that the current hymne should be replaced with “God, King of Storage” and the Russian tricolor to replace the Imperial flag, wrote polit.ru.
Assad encouraged all the forces to be united in the fight against terrorism.
The President of Syria, Bashar Assad, called for all the forces to be united in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is sure that if Europe wants to deal with the refugee problem, they should stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is, not that Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but that the primary causes of the problem should be addressed.
If the Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
That's our opinion on this problem.
"It is the point of refugees," he said in the RT interview.
We must continue dialogue on achieving consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are impossible as long as people die, as bloodshed continues, and as long as people feel completely safe.
"So we can reach consensus, but we cannot realize anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria," Asad stressed.
Recall, about 500,000 migrants, including Syria, arrived in the European Union this year.
The European Commission stated that the current migration crisis in the world was the biggest since World War II.
There is no exception that thousands of extremist migrants in the Islamic State can be among the arrivals of migrants in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization prohibited in Russia can use the situation to establish their cells in the EU for terrorist activities.
The German city’s inhabitants had a celebration for refugees.
In the last month, Germany has become a refugee leader, although recently it has strengthened border control in order to stop the influenza.
According to the authorities, about 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts call it considerably large numbers.
More than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country since September.
The correspondent of BBC Jenny Hill visited the city of Darmstadt, whose inhabitants have a very warm reception for migrants.
Jeremy Corbin debates at the Prime Minister ' s session
After Mr. Corbin's election, his debate was expected at the session of the Prime Minister ' s questions.
The new leader of the Laborist Party, Jeremy Corbin, will soon speak to the Prime Minister for the first time, measureing forces with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will speak with the first of the six issues raised on the second half of the day; the press and members of the Parliament of the Laborist Party will probably be monitored closely.
He called for " less theater and more facts" on a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he could miss some meetings by leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbin as the leader; it will take place after the appointment of the shadow office and his speech at the Threed Junions annual convention on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Lebarian leader to stand silent during the performance of a national gym in service on Tuesday, during the 75th year of Battle for Britain, criticized a number of conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several best articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing a public hymn attracted attention
Mr. Corbin's press secretary stated that he " stood in respectful silence" and acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal BBC in the Battle for Britain".
Mr. Corbin Owen Smith, however, informed Mr. Newsnight to BBC 2, that he would advise the leader of the Laborists to sing a national hymn " independently " of his belief that the need to cancel the monarchy.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to play in Mr. Corbin's team, causing disagreements on economic, defence and international policies, while less than one six members of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
The Political correspondent of BBC, Robin Brant, said that political disagreements were also "copied" in the Lebarian Party after the appointment of Mr. Corbin for the post in the European Union and the restriction of compensatory payments by the Government.
Mr. Corbin stated at the Conference of Tred Junions that the Leiborist Party had made amendments to repeal the constraint itself as a whole.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the Shadow Minister for Labour and Pension Payments stated that there was " full clarity" in the party that it had only been opposed to the Government's plans to reduce the top limit from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the leuborists with whom David Cameron will meet at the Courier Box in the past ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Leader of Leaders, who promised a different policy approach, stated that he had “incorporated collective resources” to raise Mr. Cameron's ideas and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Member of the Parliament of the County, Eilington North, stated that the issue of the Prime Minister was excessively confronted and that he would refrain from clever responses and exchange of quantities, instead promised to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and problems arising from youth.
Mr. Corbin stated that Angela Eagle, Minister of Economy in the Shadow Office, would replace him with the issue of the Prime Minister when he was absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also gave the idea to allow other colleagues to speak whenever possible, saying that he was referring to the speaker of the Communities' House to John Bercough to discuss this issue.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to leave the political style of the " fertile balagan " often associated with the procedure of the Prime Minister, but acknowledged a few years later that he had failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the issue of the Prime Minister has become a key indicator of the leader ' s views, their ability to manage the House of Communities and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although criticism claims that this has become a cartoon and requires large reforms.
"Shot in Yoburg" No homeless young people learning for photographers
Johannesburg's business center is a difficult place for homeless people.
However, a group of ex-believers found a way to earn an acquisition and to earn for life.
"I was taken in Yoburg" -- a non-commercial studio that trains the homeless young people to take pictures of circuits and earn it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.

The sterling pound grows as the salary increases in Britain
The fund increased in Britain's salary growth, with FTSE 100 raised by the SABMiller proposal.
Since May to June, Britain's earnings were 2.9 per cent increased by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate has been the highest since 2009 and has been met as a transfer for a early period of forecasts for possible growth of ratios.
The sterling pound grew more than 1% in relation to the dollar and amounted to $1.5505, and 0.84 per cent per euro, with EUR 1,3730.
FTSE 100 increased to 6229.21 per 1.49 per cent.
Generally, the SABMiller shares, which grew by 20 per cent through the purchase proposal from AB InBev.
The deal would combine two biggest beer companies in the world by collecting brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The Burberry shares have increased by 0.9 per cent of the promoting news from the competitive group of Lux Richemont producers.
The recent sales data of Richemont have overcome all the expectations and have shown that sales in China -- on the key market for Burberry -- have increased again.
Glencore's shares increased by 5 per cent after a mining giant stated that he was able to get $2.5 billion through the accommodation of shares that had been made under the debt reduction strategy.
The Mondi Paper and Packaging Unit Actions were leaders of the fall in the index - by 4.3 per cent - after Goldman Sachs reduced the rating of the group before selling.
JD Sports shares grew up after the company, the sports supplier, reported 83 per cent increases in taxes up to 46.6 million pounds.
Chief JD Sports said that higher salaries could prevent expansions.
The Executive Director of JD Sports Peter Kaugill said that an increase in the minimum salary for British workers means “great purchase capacity in pockets of potential consumers”.
But it is unlikely that such a buying capacity would exceed the cost of work, he said.
The cost could have affected JD Sports' plans, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash is launching a campaign on an initiative from the bottom to combat Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA shops from Aldi pressure in South Australia and Western Australia.
The general supplier of food products on the initiative below launched an IGA market protection campaign in South Australia and Western Australia, in light of the ongoing influence by Aldi 700 million dollars.
While Aldi is preparing to open two opposite warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of the next year, the Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen the relationship with local food suppliers and promote IGA brands by marketing in leading media and social networks and activities such as Adelaide Show.
The campaign is joined by the IGA and IGA suppliers, such as the ice cream producer Simmo's from Dansboro, who offers degustation in IGA shops, and the owners of shops selling tickets for the South Australia Football League.
Metcash is expected to disclose more details of its protection strategy on 29 September - the day that this optional food supplier, drinking and farming goods will spend its annual investors ' strategies.
In South Australia and Western Australia, IGA stores are almost 30% of all Metcash shops and show higher rental than the Metcash IGA network in eastern states.
Customers in South and West Australia are known as customers of customary routes, so the market is more favourable for IGA rhytlers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 per cent in UA and 24 per cent in WA compared to about 14 per cent in eastern states.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi would take 5 per cent of the food market in these two states for 12 months after the opening of its first shops, taking the amount of stock from all players present, but mainly with independent rhytelers.
In the report published this week, Tom Kirat, analyst Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA ritelers could lose $360 million per year and Metcash is $ 250 million by the end of 2016.
The project is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year by selling 500 million and 600 million dollars on these markets accordingly.
The loss of supplies and sales of food products at high-level cost of Metcash could cost around 13 million revenues until the salary of interest and taxes, believes Mr. Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash was losing the share in the market in eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and that the recent research of Morgan Survey found out that IGA had the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley believes that metcash sales would fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 by reducing market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the leading manager of the Fund Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, observed that Metcash " could disappear for decades.
The Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas' comments.
However, it is expected that a member of the Board of Directors of Metcash contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
The IGA market share has decreased from 18 to 14 per cent since 2010, and Metcash's food-productive revenues, which are at approximately 1200 IGA ritilers, have fallen by 43 per cent compared to 2012 as a result of an operational deverification and the pressure on sales and rentability rates.
However, the company does not surrender, spending more than 150 million dollars a year to equate price prices at Coles and Woolworths at a thousand positions a week and helping IGA re-establishment, as well as proposing a rapidly expanding assembly of fresh products and a broader selection of business food products.
The Director-General Metcash Ian Morris said that the equation of prices and reconstruction of trade squares would be a turnover, and he hoped that the company would gain an increase in the net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Cokkinakisa supports President Tennis Australia Steve Hilly
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves respect, not criticism for his behaviour.
Tanasi Kokinakis had indirectly suffered in a recent scandal around his friend Nick Kiríos, and for his conduct he deserves more than the criticism, said President Tennis Australia Steve Hilly.
Cokkinakis, the youngest in a talented duet and often called “Special Ks”, was disadvantaged in the centre of the embarrassment of Kiríos and Stan Vaurinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly after that, during a hot qualification match at Cyncinatti, a judge on the hill had to double-display Cokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, and Harrison said, "The waveer was supposed to put on Kirjos' s shoes, and I must put on the shoes of this guy."
Since Cokkinakisa was last seen a broken missile after Rishar Gaske saved in his leg from possible defeat at the US Open, Hilly loyally protected Cokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgo, competing with Sam Grott for the right to be the second after Bernard Tomic in the semi-final of the Davis Cube against Great Britain.
"I'm very concerned about one thing, namely, that Tanasi had been involved in a conflict," said Healy.
He really broke a missile when he had his leg on US Open, but he's not the first player who broke the missile when hopes were broken, and I know Tanasi enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he was very well owned in quite provocational situations in the U.S., with Harrison, etc., and I am sure he deserves confidence.
He's surrounded by an excellent team, he's got a beautiful family, and I just think he's done a little dishonest.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he's working very well, he's got a great team, he's never had problems with other players, he's being respected outside the court, he's intensely trained, he's in a great shape, he's a very targeted and developed young man, and I think he should be evaluated by dignity.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive Kiríos for the important match starting on Friday, in view of the "both consent" of the right way for everyone, but counting that the guy from Canberra will return to the team as a long-term player.
"We first want the team to focus fully on the match, not on disputes around [Kyrios]," said Healy.
And I think Nick's got power very quickly, that people like Feder and Marray are proving, he's growing in the eyes of the public, he's making a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, and I think it's necessary to get him out of the center of attention for a while so that he can think about them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary announces emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
Having announced an emergency, Hungary crossed the border with Serbia on Tuesday on the southern border and detained those who attempted to enter the country illegally to keep the flow of migrants flying inside.
At the border, hundreds of migrants have been copied in the border, and the Serbian authorities have responded dramatically.
By stuck indefinitely on the road station between the control points of the two countries, people fleeing from armed violence in their homes broke tents and found themselves in this area.
However, displeasure has grown.
When a police helicopter circled over them, migrants screamed "Open the Border!" and cried offences to the Hungarian police of special appointment.
Some were denied food and water as a protest.
Serbia's Minister for Foreign Affairs declared "unacceptable" expulsion of migrants back from Hungary, when they were increasingly arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wishes to be part of a solution to the problem, not a cohesive damage.
It is necessary to negotiate with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dačić in Prague.
The concerns at the Hungarian Serbian border began the next day after the 28-country block failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to be responsible for 40,000 asylum-seekers in over-filled Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that the future (as the next month or the end of the year) would be reached by the agreement that the European Union member States would adopt another 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
The Chancellor of Germany, Angel Merkel and Austria, were required on Tuesday to gather the Emergency summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis covered by the continent.
Hungary, however, does not hope that Brussels or Neighbours will act quickly.
The emergency situation announced on Tuesday in two Southern regions gave power to the authorities to act on the crisis, enabling them to closure the roads and accelerate asylum proceedings.
Meanwhile, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Sierto, stated that his country planned to build a fence from a thick line on the border with Romania to close the flow of migrants across the country now when it ended the fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News News Charlie Dougata reported that even prisoners had been connected to urgent work on the closing of the fence from the thick band between Hungary and Serbia.
In the past few months, Hungary has become the main “narrow place” and the crossing of the European Union border for migrants, many of which are refugees of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister of the State, Victor Orban, insists that most of the arriving people are economic migrants looking for a better life than a refugee victim of military action that has the right to protect, and that view is sharply disparaging from the views of other EU countries, in Germany.
The new laws entered into Hungary on midnight now consider the crime of crossing or damage to a 4-foot (13-foot) fence fence fence from the thickness of the coil built by the Government along the southern border with Serbia, as well as implies longer prison deadlines for accused persons in trafficking.
" Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares an emergency situation," the representative of the Government of Zoltan Kovac said to journalists in the southern town of Seged.
We clearly understand that the illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
The formal parliament should still authorize the posting of military forces, which is expected next week, but the Associated Press reporters, who are on the border, have already observed the presence of armed to the dogs with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Deird Bacondi, a National Security Adviser of Orban, reported that 45 persons were captured by the authorities who tried to cross the border on the very border, and 15 others within the country.
They crossed the border by breaking the fence, are currently detained by the police and are accused of committing administrative violations under new laws.
The authorities are rapidly rebuilding the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passages on the border with Serbia on Tuesday in the morning, incorporating one of the passages of the railway vagon, which was wrapped by a thickline.
The disagreements exploded at the main passage across the border near the city of Rhosca, Hungary, since Hungary had placed a office room for people to pass within the metal container, and the crowds pressed each other to break in.
The invasion has been achieved by about 20 people, with thousands of people left outside.
Another migrant group blocked the main road leading from Serbia to Hungary and announced the refusal of food and water until they were released to Hungary.
Election 2016: Privilege of Hillary Clinton over Bernard Sanders decreased twice in the national survey
Former Secretary Hillary Clinton continues to hold a biennial advantage in the democratic race for nomination throughout the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is chasing it.
Clinton is currently supported by 47 per cent of the primary democratic voters (of 58 per cent) and Sanders is second with 27 per cent (up to 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Byden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential race, has been supported by 15 per cent of the primary democratic voters.
More than five months before contesting at primary elections, most democratic voters say that it was too early to say that they had been determined with the candidate whom they would support.
Clinton's stakeholders are more confident in their choice than supporting other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton lost support for some demographic groups, and Sanders received some bonuss.
Clinton has a great advantage among women and moderates, but that advantage has decreased.
Her support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is standing away from it by only five points.
The preferred Clinton-democratic voters up to 50 years of age disappeared, and Sanders and they are now equal.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among senior voters.
In the last month, Clinton has been chasing Sanders for a bi-digit number among Liberals, but Sanders now has the advantage of five points in this group.
Almost half of the primary democratic voters around the country say they would enthusiasticly support Clinton if she had become a candidate from the party.
Four would support her with some reservations and 15 per cent would only support her because she was a candidate.
Six per cent would not support it.
It may not be surprising that the current members of Clinton will probably show more enthusiasm on her account.
Among those who do not support Clinton at present, the views are more contrary - only about a quarter of enthusiasm would support it.
While 48 per cent of the primary democratic voters say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm, the smaller number of republican voters said the same about their leader, Donald Trampe (35 per cent).
When a clear question is raised to Clinton's stakeholders, why they want to see her candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the necessary experience (16 per cent), then that the time of the president is now (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for that post (10 per cent).
Furthermore, Clinton's stakeholders are referring to the association linking it to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is also called consent on issues and chances of election.
As the Vice-President considers potential participation in elections, 57 per cent of the primary democrats would like him to join the race, although the third believes that he should not.
When they are asked who they wished to see secondly among candidates from the party, the primary democrats mostly call Bayden.
Among the Clinton members, more than half says they would have chosen Bayden second, that's more than Sanders had.
If Baiden decides not to make his bid from the Democratic Party, the advantage of Hillary Clinton over Sanders will increase from 20 points to 30 without Bayden.
Fifty-five per cent of the democratic voters have seen a candidate in Clinton with the best chances of winning the universal elections; however, the number decreased by 78 per cent last month.
According to this indicator, Baiden, with great retirement in the second place, but the percentage of those who believe it as the most likely candidate has increased.
Nevertheless, in response to the question of what is most important in the candidate, democrats choose other options than the chances to be elected.
Similar to the situation last month, none of the candidates from democrats or potential candidates are an unacceptable nomination for these primary voters.
The candidates from democrats, or potential candidates, have shown good results on some key characteristics among the primary voters from their party.
Most view Clinton, Sanders and Bayden as honest and trusted people with good leadership.
Byden of all three leads in honesty, and the strong side of Clinton in its leadership.
Thirty per cent of the primary democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and reliable, twice as those who say the same about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent have no opinion on it.
The original democratic voters are also generally viewed as similar to the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Bayden.
In all these measures, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
Although the questions relating to the personal mail and server of Hillary Clinton continue to exist by its Secretary-General, most of the primary democratic voters are satisfied by its explanation and believe that this had not affected their general view of it.
But it's a very different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans today are not satisfied with its explanation, and only about a third is satisfied.
The public's views had been divided in March shortly after the history became known.
Most Americans say that the e-mail dispute had no effect on their general opinion on Clinton, although 36 per cent said that their views were deteriorated.
Mostly, these are the Republicans, more than six of every 10 who claim that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton believes that the voters are honest and reliable from her party, it continues to be a problem among registered voters generally: only 32 per cent consider it honest and trustworthy, eight points below compared to last month, and 15 compared to May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not consider it honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider the Tramp to be honest and trusted.
Clinton and Tramp, however, are both receiving good leading characteristics.
Six protested candidates of Baiden, Carson and Bush show the best result of honesty.
Most people see a more honest man in Sanders than not, but, as Carson, many have no view of him.
The margin of error for sampling from 351 primary democratic voters is 6 per cent.
As a result of the national survey, Ben Carson closed close to Donald Tramp
Ben Carson approached Donald Tramp in the last CBS/New York Times
Two of these candidates gathered half of the voters in a new survey, leaving all the remaining in search of leg resistance
The Republicans throughout the country continue to support the Tramp, whose support rate increased from 23 per cent in the recent CBS debate on Fox News last month, to 27 per cent in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson flyed from 6% to 23% for the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson was using support in all demographic groups by conciliating Tramp in the Republican electoral group with higher education.
Other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Governor Ohio John Kasic, have traveled back with Governor Wisconsin Scott Walker, whose support has fallen from 10 per cent last month to 2 per cent now.
Former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Hakabi and senator from Florida, Marko Rubio, are at a third of 6%.
The margin of a sample of 376 republican voters in this latest survey was 6% plus minus, and the survey was conducted in September.
The recent CNN/ORC survey published last week showed Carson's growth in surveys, showing support to 19 per cent among the Republicans, with 32 per cent of support for Tramp.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed that Tramp was substantially invading Carson.
As Carson's support increased last week, Tramp made several critical incidents against the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologizeed for the question of Tramp's faith.
"We need energy," Tramp said last Saturday during the closure of the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the brotherhood are accused of the death of Baruch College
About two years later, after the death of a college student during the ritual of dedication to Pokono in Mountains in Pennsylvania, a murder charge was raised against five people.
"Pe Delta Psi members of the New York College of Baruch attacked Chan Michael Deng during the September 2013 ceremony of dedication and did not bring him to a hospital in time, which caused his death," the police reported.
Officials say that a student with tied eyes and 30 pounds of sand behind his back has been pushed several times while he was trying to achieve the goal through the slippery surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
The P Delta Pcy Brothers did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and waited an hour before he was delivered to the hospital, they said to the police.
They, however, have found time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google and contact Andy Mang, the national president of the brotherhood, to ask the council, as said at the press conference, Chief of Police Chris Wagner.
" At that point, the brothers began to hide personal property, essentially by putting the well-being of the brotherhood above Michael Deng's health," said Chief Wagner.
He couldn't be saved, and he died next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng received a number of stupid head traumas, towels and beards.
"Too many families have suffered from the rituals of dedication to brotherhood, since at least one student dies each year from 1970," Douglas Fireberg, a lawyer representing the family of Deng, said in his statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be responsible, and this step of the authorities is very important.
The jury of Monroe County had been charged with the murder of the third degree for the first five members.
Twenty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, will be accused of violence against the new and criminal treaty.
"We want to bring responsibility not only to individual participants, but if there is a organization that authorized all of this officially or informally, then also," Wagner said at the press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College prohibited the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood excluded the local office from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
Increasing rates, the bull market will be spotted, the income of bonds will grow, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's going to be before the attack, and how long it's going to continue.
For the economy, history does not explain much about time.
The recession came only 11 months after the first increase in rates and for 86 months.
The force of the Federal Reserve to raise rates often, although not always, defines the response of the economy and financial assets.
The Central Bank Administration of the United States therefore urges that the investors should not focus on the time when they begin to raise rates, but on how much adaptation would take.
In fact, there are many variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants can find that all the intensity around the increase in the rates is overwhelmed.
“The first increase in the federal reserve, with a global financial crisis, will be inevitable to be interpreted by some as the signal of the end of the era of " cheap money", said Julian Jessop, chief international economy expert in Capital Economics, in his commentary for clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of the interest rates in the United States to a more normal but still low levels to be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here is the view of how some areas of the economy could react depending on historic trends:
As the market has already seen in the last month or somewhere, the expectation to increase rates may lead to unsustainability for a while.
However, with the increase in the rate, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
"It does not seem to be that revenues from shares are delayed for 12 to 24 months after the first jump, which is likely again reflecting the delay in monetary policy," said the Deutsche Bank analysts in recent research of the feasibility of the Federal Reserve.
If more specifically, the market for the past about 35 years is sharply changing - approximately 14 per cent - in order to increase rates, remains sufficient for 250 days after that (average growth of 2.6 per cent), then, after 500 days, returns to the normal state of average income of 14.4 per cent for the last six cycles, according to the recent analysis carried out by Bob Doll, the principal Trade Trade Strategy in Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
The Deutsche said that the result for securities has a tendency not to become more explicit at the stage of the increase in the rates, and the income from shares begins to decline.
Recessions are the fact of economic life, but increases in rates often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is set under conditions that have not existed before and may accelerate the recession.
Mostly, the gross domestic product will be located nearly in its lowest point during the existence of a higher rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases of increase in GDP rates since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 per cent.
Even in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 per cent, but few believe that it was for a long time, while it was only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
Increasing rates on such an unstable economic background may be risky and asks the question " whether this time will be different," reported Deutsche.
The market participants are preparing to increase the Federal Reserve System's rates all year, with their views attached to the meeting of the Federal Committee of the Open Market, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategies and economists believe that FOMC could approve the increase in the rates at the meeting, fertiliser trade is only a 25 per cent probability.
"In our research since 1950, all the increases in rates have been in the supercycle of increasing financial rise at GDP, covering the recession, very quickly after the start of recovery," the report states.
In contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle is the longest that the Federal Reserve System has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it has not been completed for 74 months.
The fixed income has also become unstable while the market expects the increase of the rates, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one implemented for action.
The principle of difference is that the bonds will result faster than for action when the Federal System changes the strategic course.
In the case of bonds, income changes the vector immediately after the first increase/minimization of the rates in the cycle.
At the end of the increase in the rates, the income of the bonds immediately falls," Deutsche reported.
Charles Schwab's strategy experts believe that the increase in rates would lead to the long-term and short-term income levels to be closed by making the curve more flat.
High-income bonds often act better in such a climate, although "we are still afraid of income hesitation," says Cathy Jones, analyst of fixed income in Schwab.
It is interesting that Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expected results of the Federal System's policy.
" In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the fall of inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has fostered the prospect of a stronger monetary policy," she wrote.
The rates of short-term loans increased, the income curve was more flat, credit fronts increased, volatility increased -- all the characteristics of the market when the Federal System ' s policy was reinforced.
In general, companies leading their primary business in the United States will win from the increase in interest rates, and the local product will become more attractive.
International debt companies will be in the worst situation, as the growing dollar makes their production more expensive in the world market space and their debts more expensive in financial.
"History shows that " quality" shares show the efficiency of the market above three months after the initial increase of the rates," said Goldman Sachs' analysis report for clients.
Companies with a stable financial condition have succeeded in unstable conditions as a result of each increase in the rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by a average of 5 per cent.
Companies with high capital income, as well as low voluntary shares have also shown better efficiency than low-quality shares, average of 4 (percentage items) and 3 (percentage items) respectively.
The debt will be a big question.
Companies with a high percentage of swimming debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to pure market deals, consumers will benefit from a growing dollar.
Investors could also see profits through higher income, although experts distinguish how quickly this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 - Copie of Classic FM," endorsed by a member of Parliament from Conservators Andrew Bingham
Member of Parliament of Conservators, Andrew Bingham, criticised the station for " reducing standards "
Proves that it becomes less distinct from a commercial competitor
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, saying that the prize was just screwed with Brits.
Damien Collins, a colleague in the voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 is transformed into Classic FM," said the leader of the parliamentary members, urgeing the television company to prove that it is doing anything that commercial companies do not do.
Member of Parliament from Conservators Andrew Bingham also stated to the BBC leadership that the public radio seemed to be " stupid" and becomes less distinct from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems -- I don't like to use the word "simplification" -- but it seems to be classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards Prize, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which was launched last year, looks like the Britishs under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different -- there are two examples that first came to me that you're actually copying what you already have on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of BBC rejected the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitor when it concerns live music and audience education.
What I'm learning from Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his loyalty to live speeches and music will not really be compared to anyone else.
"Really important, I think the interest in Radio 3 in looking for new music and promoting new works," he said.
Earlier this year, the BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davie claimed that the radio stations had to work much more to attract the audience than the past, because the British were less educated in classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only child of BBC who was attacked for the attack on five commercial competitors during the hearing of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
Member of the Parliament of Tori Damien Collins attacked the The Voice, a musical show of talents that BBC bought from the Dutch Talpa Media for the orientation price of 22 million pounds of sterlings.
Do you see why this programme is often discussed in the absence of originality and distinguishing characteristics?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, which is participating as judges in Palom Faith and Boy George, was made in the "type BBC style".
He added that he wanted the Corporation to " find a hit in its own home stallion" the next time it launched the entertainment project.
However, it does not consider it necessary to interfere with the procurement of the new seasons of the Voice in the future or the use of the money of those paying the licence for other entertainment formats.
The growing Internet sales has been at the maximum delay in August, and it may be Black Friday.
The first three months of 2015 increased online sales by seven per cent
Last month, the slowest growth has been observed since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales have been intensified three years ago using mobile devices for shopping
Experts are convinced that the November Black Friday could help restrain the waste
For about ten years, the virtual shopping experiences a bum, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there have now been signs of online sales equipped after the latest data showed only seven per cent increase during the first three months of 2015.
Total online shopping costs in August showed a minimum increase since they were started to be fixed in 2000 by only five per cent.
Experts say that the signs of online sales have now arrived after the latest data showed only seven per cent increase during the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates in previous years and return back to 2000, they have always found a reasonable explanation," said Guardian Andy Malkehi, the IMRG Sales Index editor.
He explained that online sales had been intensified three years ago when the buyers started using their mobile phones to buy.
This meant that more people had been able to buy online, and that they could do so under any circumstances, for example, by sitting on the couch.
But now it's on the plate, and you can see the decline.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is referred to as one of the reasons for slowing sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying before the last Friday of November.
Last year, the buyers took five times the average speed to the computers in order to benefit from profits by distorting a number of seller websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers enter this fight for profitable purchases, could make people refrain from shopping
According to the study published by the British Retail Consortium, more than 1 pounds of sterlings from every 5 are spent online.
With regard to goods such as television and washing machines, more than one third of them is sold through the Internet stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more eager than in fashion stores in central streets.
Muslims bury the dead in the fall of crane in Mecca, and Ben Laden's family is sanctioned
Muslims carry out 29 dead bodies on the streets, since the first funerals in Mecca are beginning.
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the accident of the Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that 394 people were also traumatized after the crane was disturbed
Thousands of Muslims came from all over the streets to bury 29 of the victims killed by the crane to the main Mckey mosque.
Mostly, the white, attended on the funerals, captured the passing part in order to give respect to the first of the victims who had gone to their last trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad procession passed past the holy place, where only a few days earlier the construction crane broke the ceiling of the machete and fell on the folks.
The bodies were issued for the funeral, and the King of Saudits, at the same time, punished the construction company belonging to Ben Laden's family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 inhabitants who were killed when the crane was destroyed in the Main Mosque, carrying on the streets
Among the victims was the father of four children, Kasim Akram, from Bolton, the Great Manchester, who was in his first pilgrimage trip when the cran had crashed.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Machete with his parents before the beginning of the annual hadge.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hadge to Mecco will continue, since thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the arrow of the tap raised with a unemployed tap.
In the Arab version of the decree published by the Saudi Press State Agency, Binladin Group said that it was partially guilty of the disturbance.
The English news agency did not tell the details, but reported that the leaders of the company had been prohibited from leaving outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the reason for the fall of the crane in the main machete court, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gained to go to the hadge this month.
The Binladin Group did not make any statements on the disturbance of the crane, and its representatives were not available to comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and inadequate harmonization with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes are surrounded by the Main Mosque of McKee, within the large construction work run by the Binladin Group.
For decades, the family of Ben Laden has been involving the nearest ruling family of Saudi Arabia and runs largest construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaida, Usama Bin Laden, was the son of a changer, from whom the family denied in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain only a few days before millions of people arrived in the Kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is at least once in life for each abilityful Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million ryals (about 174,000 pounds) to the victims, and the same amount was unduly damaged.
The rest of the victims will receive half of that amount.
Chapter B&Q claims that the trend is due to the existence of eastern European masters working for small money
According to Veronica Lori, British are increasingly employed by repair professionals
The number of qualified workers from Eastern Europe grows
Result - opening more than 200 new Screwfix shops for professionals
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores throughout the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, Main City Correspondent Daily Mail
It is said that the British postpone hammers and malards and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to carry out work in the house.
If you know how to treat a hammer or to paint the walls fancyly, it seems that you are in a minority today.
Because, according to the owner of the B&Q company, the British are increasingly hiring master professionals to carry out urgent homework.
Veronica Lori, a new Director-General of Kingfisher, owning a home service network, reported that the trend is a significant flow of qualified masters from Eastern Europe offering minimum price services.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specialized for master goods, while closing 60 B&Q stores.
Ms. Lori said that she would like to see more women in the B&Q shop, since eight of the ten purchase decisions were taken by representatives of the weak sex.
At present, most of the staff are men.
She said that the recent demographic trends of households, consisting of single women, could not be overlooked, as well as in the past.
Ms. Lori said, "The men still work mostly in our shops.
It is necessary to take steps to achieve balance.
In general, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decision on acquired goods are taken by women.
Women play a great role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of the five women who are headed by British companies whose shares are taken into account in FTSE100, also changed the composition of the top manager team by reaching equal number of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which 50 per cent of women governors, including the Director-General and the Financial Director.
Ms. Lori said, "It was a conscious solution, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding appropriate women in the board of directors was not complicated.
Following the closure of shops, Kingfisher showed a decrease in income and sales in six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, owning Screwfix and B&Q, opens 200 new shops
Time of decision on the interest rate of the United States Federal Reserve
The world observes the Federal Reserve Bank meeting, which discusses the adoption of an important decision during two days, to raise or not the interest rate for the first time in the last decade.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters revealed that almost half of those who believed last week that the Federal Reserve would go on this, now believe that it would still be temporary and maintain a rate at the current range of 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, since it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve has declined the rate to zero.
For the first time, we approach that the main bank may move with zero marking and start the process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Killede, headquarters of the Institute of International Economy of Peterson.
The United States economy works effectively, the economic rise adds trillions of dollars to the balance report, and the inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision would affect the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should be preparing for changes, but they were confident that all chances were against such a step.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
"Open!" - hundreds of refugees are scanned at the Horgosh control point at the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has crossed the border for the immigrants.
The asylum seekers are already starting to squeeze other options for the European Union.
One of them is in the circulation of a closed border with Serbia through Romania.
The second, through Croatia and Slovenia, to Austria.
According to some data, buses that drove refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the city of Shidu at the Croatian border.
The drivers were ordered by the authorities to follow without delay.
The Serbian Minister for Interior, Nebojša Stepanovic, assures that his country is doing everything dependent on it to help refugees, but its capabilities are limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as far as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to ensure their humanity.
But this is a general European problem.
It's difficult to decide, no country in Europe will deal with it alone, and the smaller country like Serbia is even more.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open a border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But the Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban is inclined:
If someone is called a refugee, it must fill the documents necessary for that purpose in Serbia.
And if he does not, he will not be released in our country, because it is safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already built a 175-till-meter fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop at this: he plans to build the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Maimaracis: "Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis Maimaracis had been involved in the right-centrist Governments that, in the opinion of the left, the country had a financial crisis.
He now, as a temporary leader of the New Democracy Party, challenges Cyprus.
A few days before the elections, he met with journalist Euronius.
Mr. Maymarakis, welcome to Euronius!
Vangelis Maimarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronius: Nine months ago, your party suffered a defeat by withdrawing the SIRISA coalition, but now, according to the surveys, " New Democracy " was compared to it by popularity.
What changed during that time?
Vangelis Maimaracis: Greece has changed, and we have changed.
Mr. Cypras lied a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had the profit of the budget and the prospect of economic growth.
At present, the country has a budget deficit and a high level of unemployment.
Investors have gone because Mr. Cypras has expelled them.
In the last nine months, Greeks had the opportunity to evaluate the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises of Mr. Cypras.
And now they can easily compare what was promised to what really happened.
Daily life has become significantly worse compared to January, when the situation has improved, with this concerns the majority of Greek citizens.
Euronius: But you are saying that if you win the elections, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SISU.
Vangelis Maimaracis: The point is, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
Not accidentally, in all other countries where rescue programmes have been operated or are still acting, political forces and all the ruling parties were gathered together to implement the programme that they had reached their consent without declineing from their political or ideological autonomy.
That's why I firmly believe that only political and institutional cooperation will allow the country to move forward.
Euronius: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Cypras and country creditors.
If you become a new prime minister on Monday, will you fulfill this agreement or try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Meimarakis: We actually voted for the movement of Greece on the European path, because we have a good idea of what destructive consequences would have resulted from the country's exit from the EU.
Europe now helps us with grants to our farmers for their production, we have solidarity funds, UNKER's package and banking assistance.
All of this would be lost if there was no agreement with Europe.
However, the current measures of a severe savings have resulted in the way Mr. Cypras had negotiated.
I know Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government wishes to make order during the first year, it acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the salvation programme, then I am sure that all the commitments that cannot be implemented because it leads to a recession can be a subject of negotiations, but only after a certain period of time.
It would be wrong to believe that in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, since they are expecting full implementation of agreement.
If we want to restore their confidence, we must continue privatization, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed to continue to benefit from the EU funding advantages and large investment opportunities that we need to open to better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Government of Cypras has not presented any serious arguments on many key political issues that we have learned by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give an example of farmers' income.
We explained to our European partners that it is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the Ministers of Cypras never told us.
The Greek ministers were not prepared and not well informed, therefore negotiated and concluded an unsuccessful agreement.
Euronius: If you win the elections, you will soon be at a table with Mr. Junker, Olland, Ms. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them differ from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras told them?
Vangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014, we were trying to fulfil the 2012 agreement with the sharp corners in it.
We have advanced reforms.
Of course, we were lacking the necessary resolution and speed, but we acted in emergency circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers ready to pay the price of the Greek Government.
At that time, I was a parliamentary speaker, and I have been able to agree with the views of the three parliamentary groups that were then the government majority.
Despite their serious ideological disagreements on key laws, we had a working parliament in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as the mass demonstration of outside.
And we have managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the preliminary universal elections resulting from December's presidential elections.
Euronius: The recent weeks in Greece have been running the mass flow of refugees.
What do you think of the situation and the response of the European countries in which these people strive?
Vangelis Maimaracis: The crisis with refugees is a bomb of slow action with which we will be dealt after the election victory.
The reason is that the Government of SISA did not act in that situation as it was expected.
In such matters, caution should be taken, because if the problem encounters you, only emergency measures remain.
And now we are in this situation.
Even the temporary Government that changed SISIS did more than Mr. Cypras did in seven months in only seven days.
I am sure that these actions of the temporary Government, which will provide valuable assistance to the President of the Republic that called for the EU summit, will allow to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of war in Syria, the victims of some emergency events that happened to them.
This issue has a deep humanitarian aspect, and we will stick to the position that European policies should take in this new situation.
The appropriate decision should be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations should also be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border control and refugee recruitment centres.
We should also effectively use the economic assistance that we receive from the EU in order to be able to deal with this critical problem.
Mr. Maymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Thank you.
In the Peace City, Friends of the Donetsk Area during the day, the criminal search officers of the Main Military Office together with military counter-intelligence established and detained the suspect who was 34-year-old Ukrainian military officer from the city of Krivoy Rog (Dnepropatros area), who had fired the machinery in the evening during the joint use of alcoholic drinks, and the conflict in the village of Verchnetorek Yasinowatch of Donetchina.

A man who opened the shooting at the Delta University left an apology note
After the shooting and murder of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning, and before he shot and killed his colleague later the same day, Shannon Lamb wrote a note that he "regretted" the first murder and wished "everything to return", the authorities reported on Tuesday.
Police in the city of Gothia, Mississippi, reported that a geographical and public science teacher at the Delta University called 911 around 10 hours in the morning.
On Monday, he told me he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatchman that the police needed to send people to his house.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there was a dog in the house, which "no one touches" but is probably upset.
The police were interested in the name of the caller, but he didn't call him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the shooting.
When the police came to the crime scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a letter from Lamba, 45, which said, "I'm sorry to bring it back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
By writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta University where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on Monday, when he was surrounded by the police, killed himself.
The university rector William Laforge told him he had no knowledge of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb obviously had something in mind."
Despite the information provided on Monday that Lamb had predicted a romance between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services reported on Tuesday that " no information or evidence " of a love triangle " .
Prentiss called Sean O'Stin, who reported that he was married for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Stin told me he and Prentiss had a daughter of 19, and she's "that she's uncomfortable."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Lindsay Knowles, whom San Gerald calls a close friend of Prentiss, the last one worked from home on the Internet.
Nouls told me Prentiss had a hunter called Lightning dog, and she met with Lamb for about three years.
Nouls said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his relatives on Monday at some point to say, "He won't go to jail."
The same night when the police hit him on the "1" road near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot there.
According to the summary on the university site, Lamb received a degree of education at the Delta University.
Stars Lost Happiness
Actor (left), on the photograph with his son Redmond (right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001, he fought with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-year life partner, Farra Fosett, who died of cancer.
The actor was also reported to suffer from drug addiction and was arrested for drug storage in 2008.
All of this, of course, played its role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United arrived for a few months due to a double breakdown
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the Championship League, where Manchester United lost PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defendant is concerned about this, which makes it impossible to go to the field for at least six months, Louis van Gall hopes that Shaw can play again in this season.
The trauma occurred during Hector Moreno's unreasonable subpoena at the 15th minute when the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV fine zone.
He was assisted in the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He's got a double breakdown, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transported to Manchester tomorrow or a day later, and then operated.
This terrible -- the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcome the great difficulties and started playing fantastic, and that's where it happened.
There was a oxygen mask in his dressing room.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double breakdown, it's six months, and the guy can't play a group stage.
I hope he can play again in this season.
The sea was lucky he didn't get a red card and has not been assigned to a toolbar.
The arbitral Nikola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gal believes the Italian judge made a mistake.
You judge yourself when I say it's worth the tools and the red card.
It was a very bad pinch with two legs.
In his Twitter, Shaw says, "Thank you all for your messages, not to describe how desolate I am, my way to reconstruction begins, I'll be back even stronger than I was."
Furthermore: Manchester United has suffered an unfortunate experience with Luke Shaw at the defeat of the PSV game
The English defender will be further incentived to improve the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said, "It's a very heavy trauma."
When any player gets injured with this kind of injury, everyone is very upset with it.
This was never the intention of our players to trauma the opponent.
The sea was crossing his legs when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team under the leadership of Van Gallo at the World Championship in 2014.
"He is very difficult now, because he had no intention of hurting the opponent, and when you hear that it was a very severe trauma, you feel bad," said Coku.
I didn't have a chance to see the moment myself.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was flying in another direction, so it seemed like he (Moreno) touched him, but I didn't see a pot under Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6 Moreno, he said, "I know what it is, I know how difficult it is to bear.
I'm very hard, and I'm sorry.
Andres Guardado from PSV was also transported to the hospital after the confrontation with Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lorax?
Each parent takes one thing very quickly: if your child likes a book, it will be a while before you know it almost in vain.
I guess unless you're David Cameron.
Answering the question of the representative of the company dealing with the organization of holiday holidays on his favorite child book, the Prime Minister elected " Lorax " - a tale of environmental disposal written by Dr. Susis in 1971.
This was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in the commentary published on the SuperCamps website, and continues, "This jolly, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love reading my children because it always reveals a picture or a message we miss."
Anything would be good, except the last paragraph in which Cameron was supposed to refer to the content of the book, but in fact, the story of the one-named film taken in 2012 with new characters and details added to a rather short original report.
"In the surrounded high walls of the city of Svemuzville, where there was no green or even air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to conquer the heart of Audrey, the girls of his dream, fulfilling her desire to see the tree," we read in the text of the description of the love story of the unknown Dr. Suzu (real named Theodore Sue Gazel), who died in 1991.
If this does not seem suspicious, Cameroon's text is read almost as a short story of the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database: "In the surrounded high walls of the city of Svemuzville, where everything was artificial and even air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girls of his dream."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, as a generally active parent, is so stranger to the contents of a book in which the unnamed boy will learn about the destruction of the environment of the greedy trees and the "multifier" of Nanadkins, despite the protests of Lorax (which name is given in the name of the book) - a funny creature with the muscles who "keeps on behalf of the trees".
Such an incomplicated PR task was probably assigned to a performer who had never read a book about Laurax 20 times in a sequence.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text was allegedly received from Cameron's office in the electoral district.
The SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameroon headquarters, but no further comments were followed.
Adam Lit clearly had a risk of not entering the england congregation, but it was still a difficult issue.
Conquering Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a challenge, but if you look at the collection that England has chosen for this tour, repeating the test series with the 3-0 last time, I don't think it's possible.
I would not also exclude the victory in my field.
The Alister Cook team may be less experienced than the one that had been three years ago, but there are players with virtually rising balls and collective thinking; they will not bring scars from 2012, but only a youth positive.
With Moen Ali's ball, it turns into a bouler that gives the balls, and Adile Rashid, even if it is an unknown test-level figure, is an attacking option.
Furthermore, Adam Litt was expelled from England's test criquet and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to exclude Adam Lit for me, his chief coach in Yorkshire, of course, is difficult to analyze.
His seven test matches had two good attacks in difficult circumstances and the obvious but violent reality was that cricket players were assessed by judges by the result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, what led to this announcement, because the players (and I said it before) choose themselves best.
Pair of hundreds, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in the power of its own fate.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The chief coach of England, Trevor Bailes, has spoken well about his mood even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; he's a team player, and then everything else.
The question is how long it's going to be before the betsman of the test criquet leaves an impression on himself is a complicated question.
Lit played seven games like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton was nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play on his own and on a foreign field.
The only thing you could see is that England has chosen Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Prime Minister Liga when Litt was in the best form, but that was the lost opportunity already in the past.
Alex Hayles is here, and he's the Batsman I appreciate highly.
He's an unpredictable cricket, which we saw at the Yorkshire club at the beginning of this season, when he earned 236 in a game against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
At least, it should be given the same opportunity as those before it, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the OAU team.
Thinking of putting Moan next to Cook as an opening betsman, which would give you an additional spinner by storing four speed bowlers, considering, and I don't mind at all.
I can't see the reason the beating player can't take the ball in there, and that leftman has already shown that he's a damn good cricket.
Moan may not be exactly what it takes for his County Woostershire, but has become a third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old Justin Langer team companion played his first 38 test games "third betsman" before he was opening in 2001.
He won right away three hundred and didn't look around.
Zafar Ansari comes to the assembly as a backup, and with my long-term communication with him, he seemed to be a very promising young man.
People can look at his example statistics - on average 31 with a bit and 35 with ball - and think it's a risky rate, but among the spinners who vote for a little bit, and the chosen ones have chosen youth.
He'll learn a lot about this tour.
In addition to the gathering, England plans to make a few practical complements to the coach.
The appointment of Mahela Jayauordine, Sri Lankan Betsman, as a consultant for test matches, could be a master move.
He is one of the best players for the game that will bring to it the richest experience gained under all possible conditions and attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in the games where the white ball is used, and will ensure both energy and unsatisfactory pace in the setape.
I always felt that he was born to be engaged in an international cricket, either game or training, and, like Mahela, has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new votes in the dressing room, even if they say what they have already been said, can give new forces to the team.
Colleague College Darema Ben Stokes was left for the same days, Ruth was given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I, for example, have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees with this, coaches and players do not define the schedule.
And you must remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
The UK camp can win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron's unreasoned policy on renewing the negotiations on the preservation of Britain in the EU is increasingly difficult every day, even without reviewing the choice of a genius Jeremy, "It is yes or not?"- Corbina's leader of layborists or the tuc of Europe on Tuc on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbins and Nigel Faraji.
The friendly European diplomat explained at the time that, with the situation in which the EU now faces various crises, not all of them had their own production, some participants were situated on the throat of the British egocentrical agenda of seing disadvantages and undermining agreements that they mainly did not want to change.
After meeting at Bryton on an annual meeting, TUC decided that he would not want them in any case if they were destroying social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's Self program.
The Prime Minister and the Finance Minister are riding on summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capital, photographing themselves on the background of a known local monument, in the local famous company or without it, then coming home and saying they attract allies to reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wishes to maintain external contacts to the British under the Euro union - "Don't leave us with France," said Berlin - suggests that the ministers and officials in some capitals get to understand when they will be concerned, we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a very cautious Chancellor of Germany, is a alliance, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before she gets worse, as it deteriorated for the Tatcher (11), Mitterran (14) and Cola (16).
France head François Olland stands before reelection or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland may soon receive the nationalist Government of the right push, Spain to the left.
It's hard to see them climbing out of the skin to help "selfies" whose energy could be spent to prevent Scotland's exit from Britain, which they don't want, because most people have similar separatist trends.
So some such ministers can even plan to extradite intentionally useless SNP removals during the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to strengthen the exit process of Great Britain from the EU, my friend suggests.
"Review was a fixed idea" and "Britain has not received anything valuable from the resumed negotiations."
The Europeans know what a predator could be the Flit Street and how skeptical on the EU are media magnates, unlike the time launched by Tony Benn's referendum in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 by ratio 2:1.
They may shyly remember Boris Johnson, the rooted Euro-oportunist, who was famous by his " direct EU bananas" of the Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his nonsense, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a scary company from fearing taxes of fraud, alien hackers and alien non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had the same opinion on them, but he had given himself a record that when you're in a bull of fuel, you should give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Milliband was a bigger commitment to Blair than Blair himself in contrast with the idea of Cameron's referendum, as Blair entered the principles for the abolished EU constitution buried by the French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him.
But Jeremy Corbin, who friendly grabbed me on my back in Westminster on Monday -- I told him he had no more time to waste it on me -- he seems to risk repeating the Neal Kinoc's "boycott" of the 1980s -- a mistake and now.
It may take time, but it must develop a consistent strategy of interaction with the press, not with me, but exactly with Andrew Marr, whom he was sitting on the couch at the WFC on Sunday.
The official position of the Corbin for Europe is what I deliberately call evolution.
He said he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditional trend of Ukip and a broader circle of "foreigners of small England" among tors may probably say yes.
It's the same thing as Hillary 'Benne, but not Bennith'-Benne said on the radio and TV this week, and his internal scouring from all forces refused to admit that the appointment of the Corbin of the notwithstanding John McDonnell was a bad idea for a shadow minister of finances.
This reminded me of the '70s when his old father was fighting on TV for inloyalty to colleagues in the Laborist office without going too far and not losing his post in the office of the ministers.
Hilari's battle was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain “in any circumstances” is Ben's phrase, not what McDonnell said, or not that J.C. told the parliamentary parliamenters at a private meeting on Monday night, in general.
Whatever democrat and his boyfriend Corbin wanted to report there -- remember, he even touched me -- the discipline of the messages remains important for the seven-day television ages a week, and especially in the vacuum of social networks, paranoid and treason.
It is reasonable not to allow Cameron to leave Europe so easily, allowing him to accept as appropriate support from the layouts during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But the main deception of McDonnell and Corbin for membership in the EU, within the Bennith economy of the contaminated fortress, is no longer the issue of esoterical discussion among the left dissidents, for which narcissism, which is born by a minor distinction, is a central principle in doctrine disputes.
With regard to his errors on Nato Tom Watson, reliable in the fact that J.C. would not agitate for exit, foreign diplomats would be obliged to try to bring this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital -- they also have suspicious voters -- on the concessions of Britain, when all of this could be meaningless?
The United States has already been very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even when the Government of Towers cuts out the costs, as I was reminded on Monday during a lunch forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health of England
The statements funded by the Government of the agency that electronic cigarettes were 95 per cent less harmful than smoking have sounded at the meeting of 12 people, some of which are related to tobacco industry, as the researchers reported.
The experts published in British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet criticized the evidence used by the Public Health Agency of England (PHE) in their electronic cigarettes report.
The PHE issued an important report -- "reverse" last month, called it "the full review of evidence".
However, some researchers questioned the credibility of data and pointed out some experts to the tobacco industry.
In the editing article in Lancet medical journal last month, the “extremely scrutiny” was criticized, on the basis of which PHE constructed its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, two other researchers asked whether these statements were " solid or faint".
Martin McKee, a teacher of the European Health School at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a Clinical epidemiology teacher at the University of Liverpool, reported: “Fundamental Health Principle - Rules must have a proof of efficiency”.
According to them, the public expects the PHE statements that " the current best assessment shows that electronic cigarettes are approximately 95 per cent less harmful than tobacco-cure" were based on a detailed analysis of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this is the only meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multicritional analysis of decisions to summarize their views on the harm of the various nicotinoso-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in the scientific publication.
McKee and Capwell reported that one of the congregation's sponsors was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose Director-General reported that he received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study earlier.
He also confirmed the BAT certificates in the field of health in the Sustainable Development Report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes without mentioning the funding he had previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
No reasonable explanation of the selection of members of the Council was provided, but there were several known electronic cigarettes, some of which also claimed the financing of the industry in the publication.
It is unknown whether other participants have experience in the tobacco management.
The meeting was also visited by the Tobacco Guide in PHE.
The scientific article published by the group “excellently agrees” that there is a lack of " severe evidence of the severe impact of most products on most criteria", wrote McKee and Caypwell.
However, none of these links and restrictions have been affected in the PHE report.
McKee and Caypwell said that the statements of PHE were "no evidence that electronic cigarettes are expensive, leading children or non-smoking" were in advance.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of the health and welfare direction in PHE, said that BMJ's statements had already been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco smoking."
One of the two smokers died of their addiction all their life.
All evidence suggests that the health threats from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study remote consequences.
The PHE has a clear responsibility to inform the public about what they prove and what these evidence do not prove, especially where the public had doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people per year die from smoking diseases and NHS costs 2 billion pounds per year.
It is clear that, although electronic cigarettes are not safe, they only cause a part of the smoking harm, we do our tasks before the nation.
The former chapter of Channel 4 believes that the BBC should stop the EastEnders series
The former chapter of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that the BBC should cease the release of programs such as EastEnders and The Voices, noting that their business competitors would give a lot for such successful shows as the saucer opera on Alberta's Square.
Johnson noted that licence collections should only be used to create programmes that are not issued by other British radio companies.
He criticized the BBC for putting the public broadcasting transfers, which must be only a small part of the audience, for the picnic efficiency when competitors have a high rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After the Director-General of BBC, Tony Hall, said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noticed that during six years he was unsuccessfully trying to cooperate with BBC during the work at Channel 4.
"I cannot distinguish from the idea that the BBC is preparing for launching and translating transmissions that could show competing companies without grants," Johnson told the members of the Commission for Communications of the Lords Chamber as part of finding the further fate of the BBC.
If you retain a licence collection that I do not consider to be a good solution in a medium and long-term perspective, companies should only leave those programmes that are not issued and are not going to be issued by other companies.
The Voice show is emerging in the Prime Slot because the creators want to receive the maximum possible support for the future.
The idea that no one should show it is ridiculous and apparently absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to the financing of transfers that could be sponsored without grants.
The Voice is one example, EastEnders is another; they are generally known as their own production.
Other channels would certainly be given a lot for her.
I don't understand how this can be a public announcement.
I don't think it would have humiliated BBC.
The serial entrepreneur Johnson, chaired Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of pursuing ratings " due to the ambition of staff and their belief that this is the best way to obtain support for a long term."
His comments on the most popular BBC show were revoked with the comments of the Executive Director Sky Tony Boll, who, in his lecture, McTaggart in Edinburgh in 2003, offered BBC to sell the series of EastEnders.
Johnson noted that more low BBC public transfers "continue to BBC4, where the audience often cannot be evaluated, but the function of the company has been performed, and that could be made as a argument in the hange prophecies that justify the income from the licence collections of 4 billion pounds: "Oh, of course, we are doing all these unreasonable transfers that no one is watching."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
With regard to the licence collection, Johnson informed the Committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in the matter of who will receive most of it.
Of course, you all think we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people for whom 150 pounds is big money, I'm wondering, they think so because they don't really watch and listen to BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 Executive Director, David Elstein, who also spoke to the Committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should review the Rita mission for “information, education and entertainment”.
He noted that only a small portion of BBC materials is currently formally classified as educational - he said it was 1% of the television content and 0.1 per cent on the radio - and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcast companies under the devision "information, education and entertainment".
On the issues of the Elstein partnership, BBC should make more effort in such areas as " Variable Concerts " (only part of them are shown on TV) and enter alliances with commercial broadcasting companies to make them available for online broadcast.
Sonogenetics allows brain cells to be managed by sound waves
The video shows how non-stops change the direction of movement at the time they are subjected to the impact of sound impulses.
Scientists led a worm with a genetically modified nervous system to be managed using sound waves pulses.
Little netodes change the direction of the movement at the time when sound impulses affect them, too high to hear them.
The impulses are affected by genetically modified neurons to use membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
Furthermore, researchers are running brain activity through light
Scientists reported that the worms demonstrated the possibility of a new methodology called sonogenetic, which is the purpose of using ultrasound to excite certain brain, heart and muscle cells, while the source of ultrazvuk is located outside the body.
Srikant Chalasani, a scientific officer at the Institute of Solk, La Hoya, California, told Guardian that this method could once replace a deep brain stimulation -- an invasive procedure that sends electric pulses to the brain and is used to treat Parkinson's disease.
The Nematod worms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they were beginning to react when they were placed in the fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles increase the ultrasound waves that then enter the worm body.
Strengthen ultrasound waves affect the structures called " ion channels of TRP-4", found in some worm cells.
The ultrasound waves force these ion channels to open and excite cells associated with them, reports the report in Nature Communications.
To create nomodotes that can be managed through ultrazvuk, Chalasani made genetic worm modifications, so their mobile neurons used the ion channels of TRP-4.
During the application of the ultrasound for the impact of modified organisms, the sound waves increased by microscopic bubbles and were inserted into the worm organisms by activating modified mobile neurons.
This methodology is similar to the "optogenetic" - a new direction that allows scientists to include and disable neurons using light impulses.
Chalasani claims that, compared with this sonogenetic method, some advantages can be made.
In contrast to the light that is delivered to the proper brain of the opt volcanic, low frequency ultrasound waves are without obstacles through the body’s tissues, so they do not need to pass in the skull box.
"We believe that for the treatment of certain neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of genetic therapy and therapeutic viruses can make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal," Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the methodology could be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
The forbidden torture equipment is right on your threshold!
The advertising of the British weapons trade
Look at the Amnesty International film with a protest against the exhibition of arms.
Awesome killer drones!
Destroying shaving iron candals!
Cassette bombs!
Electrical light woods that cause unbearable pain, but not leave traces!
A bold voice and drawn animation do not doubt that this advertisement of the largest international exhibition of arms is an earmarked parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the intention of the British Government to push the weapons to the repressive regimes by using the excellent exhibition of defence technologies and security systems in Docland.
Further topic: DSEI arms exhibition: Authoritary regimes are traveling to London
However, the special campaign also leads to a sudden occurrence of posters at bus stops and trains that require them to be viewed again.
"The important announcement from 15 to 18 September?" was written in one of them by the letters of the London metro with a picture of DLR line converting into a forcet tank.
In September this year, the arms trader crowd will be incorporated into DLR line. The passengers are asked to help prevent the exhibition of weapons.
300 posters were drawn by artists who exposed their work in the Museum of Cruel Design in Banks Dismaland.
The "Special Patrol" group has helped to spread them across London using "the advertising sites" a 6-pound set of gay keys, which is reportedly "provided to give access to some third advertising space at the bus stops of the planet".
The transporters of London are unhappy from such vandalism in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parodic announcements issued by the "Special Patrol" Group.
According to Gavin Greendon, the courier of the exhibition of Cruel Designs and the teacher at the Essec University, the artists are more demanding and strive to bring political art to the audience outside the gallery.
Many artists start working with protest activists, understanding that they have to go into a real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the exhibition of weapons welcomed by passengers in the metro.
A video from Amnesty was viewed over 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by the VCCP agency working for bono with a graphical designer and a sound artist, who also worked freely.
The Creative Director of VCCP Matt Lever was impressed by the advertising silence around the exhibition of weapons -- with a passage in the ExCel calendar -- and thought, "Let's make them a campaign that they're trying to avoid."
They were thinking of creating a more realistic and clever corporate advertisement, but "to fill it with bright colors and animation was more exciting."
"They have incredibly helped us to draw attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment on the exhibition," said Tom Davis from Amnesty.
We now need the Government of the Great Britain to take action and guarantee that this torture equipment will not be illegally sold directly at our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art on the exhibition of weapons is from within the ExCeL, where participants trade fantastic euphemic production.
The press release of Saab revealed information on the order of "At4CS RS for arm shooting" from the United States army.
It includes "without analogs of a cumulative battery that brings unexcessive restraint within the target."
Whatever he does, it won't be nice.
Eight Golden Rules of Housing in Student Housing
It's been 11 years since I moved to the studio as a normal 19-year-old person, still believeing in brethren and moral relativism, but only now I remember the smiles of those I've been irritating - and many long-term complaints on others.
Mostly, what I learned can be set up by eight simple rules.
Movement to the house may varies from a little nervous to an absolutely scary one.
He encourages you to talk: tell people where you came from, whether you took academic vacation and where you spent it, whether you're supporting Corbin, and why you're "honest, neither love, nor hate Marmait," because, seriously, it's just a HAHAHA extract, I'm going to be with me."
Rest.
And help others rest too - ask questions and show interest.
This supports the conversation and helps you find people you like, not those with whom you would not even talk to, even if you had a burnt bullet, and they would give fireworks.
Give people space.
People's rooms often turn into drinking facilities, midnight movies and places of common parties, but they are also the place where people dress and repair the underwear.
Furthermore, don't even think about starting a university in relations
Introverts in universities are unfair.
Your room must be asylum, but many rooms form a culture of shatation from one room to another, which contributes to friendship, association and leads to long friendship.
This may be a hell of a person who is trying to restore power.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to keep friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I can restore the energy I spent with you."
Try to feel when a companion is tired of communication and not to knock to him, but send a SMS.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my house followed the principle that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw something.
Get your friends with a bake.
Since you're starting a university life on the top of the Bake-Off show, knocking to the door to people to introduce and present a bowl of chocolate biscuits, it's not that weird action, it's not like the 1950s, "Welcome, we're neighbors, I've baked you something, and now smile and I'll ask you personal questions."
Proposing household accommodation is a great way to be friends.
Your neighbors will feel like they're obliged to talk to you, and then your face will probably be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good a baker you are.
Badly blinded mushrooms, sugar and fat will make people pretend to be asleep when you knock at them.
Food thief is a typical crime in students.
Of course, getting someone's chicken is a stealing, but is it a thief to take a little milk for tea?
Go to the milk owner.
He'll probably offer you not to be ashamed, even if it's in the inside of anger.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I'm sorry for you, but try to treat this adulter than my neighbor who poured the liquid in her milk to wash the vessels to revenge those who took it without asking.
She's in jail right now.
You should not make noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a good man, but also because you're the same people in the verdict of glass houses.
The girl in my corridor asked the neighbor to beat the sound of the drum and the bass guitar because it was three hours in the morning and she had a test.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5 a.m., she mercyfully let him sleep two hours, and then she put her music in and locked the door behind her by going to a three - hour exam.
Wasn't it romantic if your future husband moved in the same house as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be unusual, before you bite the elbows, if you accepted a neighbor as your future husband, took it, broke up and would you have to see him every day, and perhaps see him dragging all your common friends on his side?
Of course, you can’t order your heart, but if your hot neighbor is not your future husband, try to cool your own dust.
At the exciting moment when you realize someone left the keys inside his own locked room, the border between the jokes and the grass is cheaper than it seems.
Good joke is fun, but it turns into a contrary in seconds.
Learn a valuable and interesting security lesson by hiding something -- but never pack someone's tooth room and champon.
Close the door and put the keys in the glass with the water that you put in the ice cream - but don't stick the other people's stuff with Blu-Tack to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: how to establish a new operating system on iPhone after the update of Apple
A new operating system can be requested by entering the Settings, selecting the General and then the Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will allow you to download it and set it up.
Some have encountered problems after the installation when the error is reported to them that “Refreshing the annex has failed”.
In order to avoid this, users are recommended either to wait until the recovery is silent or to try to update through iTunes.
The tips on the phone will allow you to pass the whole process to the end.
The process may include the removal of applications to increase the free space, but Apple minimised the probability of this action by reducing the update, and also facilitated the implementation by a special tool that suggests to remove applications and re-establish them after the process is completed.
It is important to make sure that your phone is loaded or is next to the charged device to avoid battery discharge.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop uploading because the telephone discharge may lead to an update.

IOS 9 is now included new functions, including an improved personnel assistant, and innovations that improve iPad productivity, as well as settings that increase the speed of work and correct the operating system.
Washington responded to Russia's military activity by telephone call.
The Secretary of the United States, John Kerry, called to his Russian colleague, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support that Moscow has provided to President Asada led only to the promotion of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk to a Russian colleague, PJ Media wrote.
US Secretary John Kerry called to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss Russia ' s military activities in Syria.
This is reported in the PJ Media publication.
"Secretary Kerry made it clear that further support of President Assad by Russia constitutes a risk of achieving and prolonging the conflict, as well as negatively affecting our common goal - to combat extremism - if we also do not continue to focus on searching for Syrian conflict resolution through direct transfer of power," said the representatives of the State Department of the United States.
They also noted that Kerry repeatedly emphasized the commitment of the United States to combat the Islamic State as part of a coalition from over 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad would never be her member.
Furthermore, the United States will " be pleased to play the constructive role of Russia in attempting to resist the " Islamic State " .
Last Friday, the representatives of the White House stated that they did not know exactly what the Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
However, the Press Secretary of the White House Josh Ernest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between the President of the United States Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had not yet been said: "When the president decides that the phone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, he will call up and try to make this call."
Sam Barak Obama considers Russia ' s decision to increase the support of Assad ' s " loss rate " .
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago, when I told him that it was a mistake that the further support of Assad would only make the situation worse.
"But he did not listen to my warnings - and the situation has been deteriorated," said the President of the United States.
The imported yachts will free the payment of customs duties.
Mine-economic developments are intended to temporarily release imported yachts and other swimming means for recreation and sports from paying customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes in the list of benefits for temporary immediate imports were prepared by the Ministry on the Government ' s commission.
This was reported by the Assistant Minister for Economic Development, Elen Laskin.
In June 2015, Prime Minister of RF Dmitri Medvedev, following a trip to Crim, appointed a number of ministries - Minieconomic Development, Mintrans RF, Minculture, MID, ICB, FSB, FTS, Rosturism - to prepare proposals for the establishment of favourable yachts in coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the lack of infrastructure for storage, service and sailing.
The owners prefer to preserve their courts abroad - approximately $200 million per year in execution of European States for the content, repair and service of yachts.
The draft decision of the Council of the European Economic Commission on the amendment to the list of goods that are temporaryly released from the payment of customs duties, taxes, and taxes, provided for the full conditional release of customs duties, taxes for imported yachts and other swimming means for vacation and sports.
In the view of the Ministry, this would undoubtedly contribute to the establishment of favourable conditions for the development of the yacht in coastal zones of the country,” Laskina noted.
This issue was addressed by the Customs Tariff, Netariff Regulation sub-Commission, protection measures in the external trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, held in September and after discussion, was also approved by the agencies.
As the representative of the Mineconomic Development noted, the proposed measure for full conditional release in the import is essentially a relief.
Thus, after the protocol of the sub-commission meeting in the Government of the Russian Federation of Mineconomic Development, the European Economic Commission for Discussion with the EESC Member States explained Laskin.
The list of imported goods, which are fully exempted from customs payments, taxes, include goods necessary to facilitate external economic activities and international cooperation, for the use of science, culture, movies, sports and tourism, to provide international assistance, etc. These include service equipment (personal computers writing machines), control tools, storm equipment, scenic suits and decorations, mobile labs and master skies, race cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, journals, musical instruments and objects for religious rituals.
In the reporting service of Mintrans RF, “Reports” reported that the mandatory provisions under the sea ports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Eupatoria had been prepared, which provided for a simplified order for the establishment of the western and exit of small, sports sailing and walking vessels in the maritime port.
Mintransom is given to the captains of the Crime maritime ports to ensure the use of a simplified order of entering low-dimensional, sports sailing and walking vessels in the sea port and the exit of the ships listed from the marine port.
Mintrans has also prepared draft orders by the Government of the RF to approve the borders of the aquatory of the Crimean maritime ports.
With regard to Yalta and Feodosia, the orders have already been adopted, the others are at the stage of agreement,” the press service of the agency noted.
In the opinion of Mintrans, the Government of the Republic of Crime and Sevastopol, classification and awareness, the registeration of low-dimensional vessels used for non-commercial purposes should be implemented.
The problem is that it is extremely difficult in Russia with the yacht because of a weak-developed infrastructure.
If you look south of Italy and France, it is a whole growing industry in which a large number of people are engaged.
In Russia, everything is actually in place.
Our coast is little interesting, the only piece where the yachts can be operated round a year is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Helandjika, New Russia, Anapa.
But the great difficulty is that the border service is extremely strict in this area: a number of permits must be made to walk on the yacht.
Furthermore, within Russia, you're going to get somewhere to be filled.
For two days, it could go with its fuel and then a problem of where to take it, said Nordmaine Dennis Novikov.
With regard to the sailing sites, there are now special yachts in Moscow and St. Petersburg for the yacht up to 30 meters. The yachts are also sent to Turkey, Finland, Switzerland and Germany.
Novikov noted that the buyers of yachts were rich people, but the demand for yachts declined since the crisis began.
The World Bank granted Ukraine a $500 million loan.
The World Bank adopted a new loan project for Ukraine of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
“The new funding will support a number of priorities to reform in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine,” the report states.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Zimiao Fan said that banking reforms would help renew credits in the real economy and stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank observed the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fhanh called on the Government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
The former Polish Government approved the provision of a loan in €100 million in Ukraine, transmitted by RIA News.
In prisons, individual transgender blocks are requested.
At the Public Council at the Federal Punishment Service (FSIN) on the protection of the rights of convicted in October 2015, other issues will discuss the possibility of creating in colonies separate transgender and transvestors blocks.
This is what the member of the Board of Vladislav Grib told the " Notifications " .
He believed that, depending on the total number of convicted persons in Russia who have not been convicted with the floor, individual cells, blocks, or even (if there are many) could be a special colony for trans-sexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that determining the penalty of civilians in such isolated places is possible only after the convicts pass the relevant medical expertise that will prove that the perpetratory is a person who identifies themselves as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is sure that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the safety of penalties.
He said that the proposed practice has been successfully acting abroad: the SISO (where the accused are before the court's decision) provided for separate transgender chambers and special blocks in the correction institutions.
It's the only way to work with such criminals today.
They must be isolated because the presence of transvestites and transgenders in ordinary cameras is dangerous for them, which is the suffering for their families and the sea of problems for staff in the FSIN.
The degradation of trans from the compartments is guaranteed,” said Vladislav Glib.
Depending on the size of the city, the number of criminals with an uncertain floor, it is also necessary to calculate where to distribute them.
CISO doesn't need the individuals. Only cameras, prison blocks.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are a lot of transgenders.
As explained by the mushroom, 50 or 100 people can be contained in the bloc, and if a specialized corpse is established in Russia one, the prisoners of trans-sexuals will be able to proceed there from any region.
Citizens are contained in the SISO on the crime scene, and transvestites or transgenders from other entities during the investigation and trial are not real, but such practices for the convicts already convicted in a separate colony, yes, the Gryb considers.
Recall, before the law enforcement officers were able to decide in which case a man or woman is investigated to determine the detainee for the drug storage of a 24-year-old transexual Dmitri Kožukov (known as Alina Davis) had not been arrested.
He was released home under a resignation.
This news was widely discussed in social networks and media, since the transgender mechanism in the SIS and Russia's colonies are not yet.
The Russian human rights defender, LGBT-moving activist (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans-sexual) Nikolai Alexeev supported the idea of creating special places to be punished by transgenders, noting that abroad is also possible to identify men in the colony, men or women, depending on their own desires.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, it is a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as is the issue of security in homosexual prisons,” said Alexeev.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be made for this and for homosexuals, even more in prisons than transgenders.
However, Alexeiev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are prepared to be transseksuals in order to get into an excellent of the ordinary colony.
Of course, medical tests can be introduced before putting people in a transgender colony, but it is not always clear.
For example, in the United States, one of Chelsea Manning prisoners looked like a man, and already in prison said he wanted to change the sex," said Alexeev.
A man can feel anything.
But while there are no specific places for punishment for transgenders, I doubt that prison staff will consider the security of such people and avoid the thinness of their orientation or gender identification.
At the same time, an international expert on reproductive health in the RF Boris Lordkipanidi noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of trans-sexual criminals in the colony could severely delay the initiation of the penalty of the convicted.
A commission is a matter of sexology, the psychiatrists have long observations, not a test based on a high-total conclusion.
Today's psychiatric possibilities allow that.
Therefore, prior to gender change, potential patients are always taking such expertise -- they clearly indicate whether the change of gender with surgery is the necessary measure,” says Lordkipanide.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to introduce this system to the convicted, since the average survey takes a month.
The doctor, despite the general idea of establishing individual trans-sex blocks, also doubts that, in current economic conditions, funds for building new facilities would be appropriate, medical expertise, transgenders in Russia.
No official statistics are to be considered difficult, but if we take into account that some 5% of the homosexuals in Russia, we can say that transgenders are even less and those who have such deviation and also commit crimes, they say, " Lordkipanido.
On request to the colony, homosexuals, transgenders can now receive separate content conditions.
Michael Antipov won the Junior Peace Championship.
The world championship of chess among young people was completed in Hunty Mansisk, up to 20 years old.
The ending of the firstion was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last tour, and they had become Russian Michael Antipov, who had yet been able to provoke the Poles Jana-Kshithof Dudu, who seemed to have taken the title.
Girls were celebrated by the Ukrainian chessman, Natalia Bux.
The champion of the world in chess since September in Hunthi-Mansisk, until the middle of the tournament, seemed to have lost nearly all its intrigue, since the representative of Poland Jan-Kshithof Duda, who had issued a series of four victories (contributions on the Swiss system in 13 tours), was confidently captured by leadership.
Given the fact that Duda was a first-year-old receipt, and it was in general one of the most promising young chessmen, the probability that he would miss the gap was very small.
And even when Duda slowed down his turns and allowed the Russian Michael Antipov to reduce his retirement to 0.5 points, he remained an apparent favorite in the fight for title.
Instead, to catch the leader, Antitype had to win on 13th tour.
But even that wouldn't help, win Duda's party.
Furthermore, this victory obligation, of course, could have affected the game of the Russian chessman and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Michael Antipov was able to avoid them.
He confidently coped with Francesco Rambaldi, and then he was forced to wait for his party to finish the Duda meeting with Benjamian Bock.
Fortunately, the Polish chessman for Antipiv has struck the opposite of the Dutch to the destruction.
Thus, Antipov and Duda received the same number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had better additional indicators.
Therefore, he was the leader of the Hunty Mansi Autonomous District, whose governor Natalia Comarov, traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region.
But there was no intriguing girls in the competition.
The leader of the tournament - Natalie Buxe (Ukraine) - was enough to win the title in the last tour that it had successfully done.
Thus, the winning of Alina Bivol's Russian girl did not allow her to catch Bux.
The Russian sportsman remained the second with a distance from the championship at 0.5 points.
The exhaust changes the regional structure.
The company is united by the Privolz and Ural regions in a comprehensive Volz-Ural region, Siberia and the Dalth East to the region of the East.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As the Director of Wympelkoma noted, changes are being made to " remain a strong player on the market", to develop the company "in new, not always favourable external conditions".
In the interview with the "Russia 24" Mr. Slobodin said that they were intending to reduce " ten per cent" of staff in Russia.
Rossenger checked 78 of the Moscow Burger King's breakfast and issued 367 regulations.
As a result, the Volcolam Highway restaurant was punished by 50,000 rubs, and the large Tulian street was closed for 90 days, but it resumed the work after all violations were removed.
43 meals have violated the requirements for accommodation.
Among other violations, the unsatisfactory sanitation and sanitation content of the premises, non-compliance with the requirements of the ventilation device, some facilities have found the bacteria of the cardiac stick group.

Igor Artemiev, FAS manager, said that the Department against Indexing for 10 per cent of goods carriage and delivery of gossubsidis, as requested by the OAU RHD.
At first, they wanted 17 per cent of indexing, now they want 10 per cent and multi-billion budget subsidies, he said.
We're saying that it's wrong, it's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up expensive quantities, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money on the left and on the right.
He added that the FAS has its " much strict" proposals that are currently discussed in the Government.
Polymetal considers the possible net calculation option from Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of a total $300 million option, the gold producer reported.
In this case, Polymetal will have to compensate Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the price of sumeru and the marketing categories) which can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumer has time until 3 October to implement the option or to require compensation.
Details of the Polymetal negotiations do not disclose.
The option was concluded as part of the purchase of Polymetal project " Kissel " in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, Director of the Ministry of Housing Policy of the Ministry, reported that the Ministry, along with the CB, was developing the order of the sanctions of the builders.
"We understand that there is nowhere to do that, so we develop the appropriate mechanism," the official said.
The creatives of the Citizen Kane film will be traded.
The representatives of the Auction House, Profiles in History, reported the plans to trade black versions of the " Citizen Kane" film, which is considered to be one of the best works of the director, scriptist and actor Orson Wells.
The auction will begin in the city of Kalabas on 29 September, presenting three black versions of the scenario, each of which is $20-30.
The first of the articles, written in 1940 by Germany Manquewich, was the earlyst scenario in private collections? and called "American" -- such a working name had the film.

The Deputy Minister for Industry and Trade of Russia, Victor Eutouchov, reported that the programme of food addressing would not be a similar to the card distribution system of food existing in the SSSR.
It is a modern food aid addressed to the population and to support the effective ethnic producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate the word "food card."
It is particularly important to note that the proposed product cards should not be confused with the sound of the past time of the total deficit, the card distribution system, where the number of products obtained are normalized.
We have proposed the concept so far, if it is approved, we will propose changes in legislation," Mr. Eutuchov said.
Previously, " Y " wrote that the food card programme for the poor was introduced to the Government.

During the current year, the study of the Russian managers ' Top-1000 Russian managers is explored on 16th.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian higher echelon managers, the study results in the work of the Russian governors for the year, identifying leaders in sectors and functional directions.
The start-up of candidates consists of laureath ratings last year.
The winners last year were invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for the current year's rating and to raise members of their management team.
Furthermore, each of the candidates included in the initial list is invited to raise up to ten new managers from other companies, which would be appropriate to add to the total set of candidates.
The following functional directions of the company: financial director, commercial director, marketing director, staff director, IT Director, Director of Public and Corporate Relations, Director for Relations with authorities, Corporate Management Director.
Each proposed expert manager is sent to the invitation to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to raise its management team and to ten new managers from other companies.
The development of candidates on industry principle is carried out on the basis of the industry classifier of the Management Association: information technology, commercial banks, forest and forest processing industry, machinery, media, metallurgy, multi-proficiency holdings, professional services, communications and telecommunications, service and production of consumer goods, insurance, construction, transport, financial sector, pharmacist, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Every participant is given login and password to log in on www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information on the rest of the participants and can provide their assessments on the basis of the proposed for each functional direction of the criteria.
Based on the evaluation methodology, the principle " Best Choosing Best" is: top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
This principle allows you to obtain a maximum authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
Final evaluation results are adopted at the expert commission meetings.
All the desired candidates for the current year and repeated evaluation candidates have been invited to meet the expert commissions.
The Commission shall be organized on a functional basis: the Commission on the approval of the list of superior leaders and eight of the functional directors.
At the expert commission meetings, it is proposed to approve the lists submitted in the alphabetical order (the places are maintained strictly according to the Internet assessment and are closed prior to the publication of the rating) or to make updates in accordance with the annexed list of reserve candidates.
The names of companies are given in accordance with the rules of Russian language and standards of " E " .
At the time of publication, the rating is possible to change the status of managers and companies.
Comfortable investment rate is 10-13 per cent.
According to experts, the small and medium business credit market in January-April is 40 per cent.
What's the situation today, according to your estimates?
After the end of 2014 panic, IAS loans have decreased significantly.
The reason is clear: rapid increase in interest rates.
Loan from 25 to 30 per cent of the year was not profitable.
If the bank had previously been able to raise all its possible problems, from time to time, it could now be impossible: rates and so cloud.
The current level of IAS loans for business is uncomfortable.
For a considerable part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their occupationality.
The rate of 10 to 13 per cent would allow business to invest in a wide range of projects and create attractive income.
How satisfied is the demand of entrepreneurs for credit?
After the CB rate decreased, the situation had a little improved.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers have become much rare.
First of all, business does not understand the prospects of its development and future income.
Today the business has one way: it is necessary to learn how to work, focusing on today's economic situation in the country and the region.
The current results need to be monitored more carefully, to monitor the movement of money.
At the same time, new technologies to modernize equipment, reduce the costs of production and energy security should be used in the availability of financial resources.
All of this, eventually, allows companies to make production more competitive and maintain business even in an unstable economic situation.
What basic trends of IFRS credit markets will be strengthened and affected by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The medium rate reduction forecast will depend largely on the policy of the Central Bank, and the regulator now demonstrates consistency in reducing the key rate.
However, the radical decline in credit prices for IMBs should not be expected.
In the current situation, the problem is primarily the inflation that makes the necessary increase in interest rate to obtain real income.
Furthermore, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even when the CB rates are reduced.
With regard to the expiry level, traditionally small and medium-sized business companies, limited to both cash and economic correction, will, of course, be a greater risk for creditors.
I would not expect a significant reduction in bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the economy of the country.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That's exactly how the word Mazda is written by Japanese characters.
Beautiful, luxury, and at the same time difficult for those who are used to cyrillic or Latin.
As well as a new CX-5, the CX-5, as well as any other model of the mark: without exhaustion, attractive outside, technically completed inside.
The Japanese is already able to demonstrate its "japanese" commitment to the works of the country of the sun's inclination to the state of full excitement.
Any arguments can be made for the use of machines from other countries, and a person will, in principle, agree with these arguments, but all the conversations will be distorted from the final phrase, "But this is a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue!
Such people should probably love not only technology but everything else in Japan.
To quote from Base, to clean food, to collect catalans and to dress your girlfriend -- no, not a kimono, of course, but by the canons of the streets of Japan: sweet, creative and very unexpected.
Apparently, the Japanese school form is the only form that girls are wearing with pleasure and after school.
It has amazing qualities: at the same time sensitive and strict.
And the older a girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in appearance of CX-5 is a radiator retina with five horizontal lines.
But where the car’s shape is stronger, the new painting of the lamps and the rear lamps that can be detected in the current of the vehicles.
As before, Mazda CX-5 looks very encouraging.
Siluette is harmonious, shapes are sensitive, but the appearance has a strike.
We don't have to call the police.
The CX-5, one of the most safe in the world, can only be a standish Japanese calm.
The diesel engine of 2.2 l provides a high rotating point in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel costs of the engine with the power of 175 litres of a total of 5.9 L.A. are combined with the power aggregates exclusively by automatic transmission and completed.
Black shoes, black coat, black bag...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can select legins from the Not Cross police tape.
However, Mazda has made the maximum effort to prevent you from becoming in the place of your own DTP.
In order to further improve the comfort by maintaining the excellent management, the front and rear amortizer structures were reconstructed and optimized by the form of the plugs of the front bottom swimming.
The complete system is adapted under the Russian conditions.
The high-speed noise of the road and engine is reduced by 13 per cent.
The bath is as boring as the budgetary sedan.
Otherwise, the girl's screwing in a bath with an original painting.
For example, from a computer game in a roller branch.
Attention will be made to her not less than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has improved structures both front and rear seats, providing the optimum space stock for both broad shoulders and long legs, who has what.
The other long legs will probably appreciate that the diligence in the front of the central tunnel is now soft and not beat the ice in the expressions.
The widest set of active security systems of Mazda is proposed for CX-5.
In order to identify the potential threat, there are radars, lasers and cameras.
There is also a adaptive lighting, and warning of accommodation from the belt, and monitoring of dead zones, and safe brake.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best gears in class.
The convenient, with the minimum performance, puts a load of 561 l. The rear seats are in the proportion of 4:2:4 and each section is supplied with a separate retail - and increases the luggage section to 1560 l.
The cartoon suit in Japan is called "kigurums".
Especially, it looks like a kigurum-pijama.
It's all in it!
Of course to sleep.
But it is also to entertain small children.
Or just walking through a beast like that on the street...
Because it's so great when there's a chance to choose a nice dress, a manner of conduct or a car.
Thank you for helping me prepare the Kawaicat store.
Kiev broke the atomic union.
Kiev officially declined Ukraine from cooperation with Russia on the construction of the AEA Hmel.
The Supreme Council voted on Wednesday since the second attempt for the breakdown of the agreement with Moscow.
The agreements on the construction of the Third and Fourth Blocks have been signed in 2010-2012, but it has not been possible to implement the project.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Council of Ukraine adopted a law to break the prisoner in 2010-2012 agreement with the RF on the construction of the Third and Fourth Block at the AEC Hmelica.
The bill made by the Government only from the second vote, first supported by 210 delegates at the minimum of 226, but then 234 members of Parliament voted for the draft.
Four energy clouds of 1 GWT with BERR reactors, but only two were able to build.
The negotiations with Moscow on the construction led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, and in 2011-2012 the Council adopted the relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in Ukraine's budget, it was expected that the blocks would be required to be credited by the Russian party, but the funds have not been allocated.
Following the revolution in Kiev in February 2014 and the following cooling in relation to the two Kiev countries, Moscow in the atomic sector began to reluctance to cooperate on the Hmel AES and on the construction project in Ukraine of the nuclear fuel factory.
The only sphere where relations remained remained to buy fuels in the RF for the current Ukrainian AES (supplied about half of the production of electricity in the country), as the Ukrainian UNECE Energy has replaced Russian supplies with nothing.
The plans for the construction of the AEA Hmelina with another contractor in Ukraine have not been finalised: negotiations with Czech Skoda JS have been made in Kiev in 2014.
UN Gensek against the use of military force in the resolution of the Syrian conflict.
The UN Secretary-General Pan Gi Moon reported during the press conference that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
" There is no military decision," the AP responds to the question of the military support of Syria by Russia.
Mr. Gi Moon also reported that he would meet with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Permanent Members of the Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of the MID of permanent UNB member countries later this month.
"The meeting will be in Syria," he said.
Rather today, the Deputy Chief of Genstab WC, Nicolai Bogdanovski, reported that Genstab did not exclude the possibility of creating a future BBC base in Syria.
There's no such plans yet.
"But anything may be," said Mr. Bogdanovski.
Previously, " E" reported that the United States did not trust the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, who said that military assistance was necessary to combat the Forbidden Terrorism Group of the Islamic State in the RF.
For more information on the US doubts regarding the Russian assistance of Syria, see the " U" Russian military presence in Syria concerns Washington.
The OSCE reports on the possible meeting of Ukraine and Russia's parliaments.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine in the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) of OSCE, Arthur Herasimov, reported the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in south-east Ukraine.
"What I know is: a certain meeting is being planned this year, perhaps between Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," Mr. Gerazim said.
He also called on the implementation of the mine agreements and "to return to the normal viability of our countries".
On his view, whether dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at parliamentary level is currently possible, in the " Normandish format" or in the form of an OSCE contact group, Mr. Gerasimov, noted that the dialogue had been held, had been held mine agreements.
At the same time, politics said that in Kiev, any kind of dialogue was supported.
Previously, the representative of Ukraine at the negotiations, the former President of the Leonid Kutchma stated that the self-pronounced Donetsk and Lugan republic had not changed their positions in the trilateral negotiations, but the tone of dialogue has become more positive.
Partys were given mandates.
The electoral committee of the Lower Newgrad yesterday made elections to the municipal district's city opinion, distributing 12 deputy mandates played by the party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of electoral violations have been made by the representatives of CPRF accused of "fake coverage " .
No observations of the opposition were accepted.
In addition, he rejected the Russian Communist Party in the organization of a referendum on the cancellation of the salary for the capprimation of multi-housing houses.
The city's election officially presented the results of the elections in the pride of the Lower Newgrad on the municipal electoral district.
The list of voters in the Neighbourhood was included in 1.03 million people, the vote bulletins to the partial commission were 746.7 thousand, and 268.000 voters voted.
More than 11.7 thousand bulletins were recognized incorrect and 24 were lost.
The 12 mandates to political parties have been allocated yesterday, depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of the Single Russia, six deputy seats are relyed on Dmitri Swatkovski, Dmitri Krasnov, Vasilia Schupranov, Elizabeta Solončenko, Viceslav Rasteryev and Igor Nagorno.
The only mandate of LDPR was the leader of the Party, Vladimir Žirinovski.
The two mandates of the CPRF are allocated between Vladimir Boulan and the Deputy of the State of Alexander Tarnev.
The three mandates of " Just Russia" are reached by Alexander Razumovski, Igor Bogdanov and Michael Shalugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates should determine whether they will work as a minister in the city's mind: if he refuses the mandate, he will go to the next candidate for the party list.
The Chairman of the Górizbirkman, Alexander Makeev, informed the members of the Commission that he introduced offices for the " transmission of telegrams to Žirinovski and other things " for the purpose of refusal of mandates.
In the adoption of the election protocol, the representatives of the CPRF reported multiple violations.
A meeting vote member of the CPRF Leonid Rednokutski proposed not to accept the outcome of the vote in four districts of No.21-24, recalling that, on order of the head of the Sormovian district, the entry into the building of the four district commissions was closed.
The deputies of the Gos were not able to go long inside, neither candidates nor observers, but the resonant scandal with the door of the paradise was shown on television.
At the District Commission meetings, all observers and members of the Commission with the right to vote had the opportunity to attend.
The chap for them had stopped access only when the vote was completed and the partial commissions had not yet arrived to submit their bulletins.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
"Then the head was repaired, and the interested persons could be present at all meetings," pared the member of the Mountains of Natalie Andrewshin.
Communists objected that more than four hours in the blocked building the administration had illegally held the Deputy of the Congregation of Ludmilo Aristov, which made a statement to the investigative committee.
The opposition was also disturbed that a number of UICs began to print urnas at 6-7 a.m. in the day of the elections, and presented in them preliminary votes.
The members of the commissions with the right to speak and observers have not been informed, so they have come to the beginning of the elections at 8 a.m.
Communists are convinced that before the opening of the electoral stations, the bulletins could be uncontrolled.
However, more than 124 complaints were already examined by the mountains, according to Alexander Makeev, no violations with the drop of untrained bulletins have been found.
They did not support the members of the Commission and the proposal of their colleague from " Just Russia" by Maria Popov through the lizzie to exit with the revision of the regional legislation in order to clearly establish the time for the opening of the envelopes with prior votes, which then fall into urnee.
"In order of your own initiative, at least contact the CIC," advised Mrs. Popov Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting, a member of the CPRF, Sergei Samohin, who shouted that he ignored dozens of complaints and covered the fakes in the elections.
"You're not here, be carefuler to claim!"
The protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
By 27 September, a selection should approve the general election results, after which the first meeting of the city's thought of the Neighbourhood of the Sixth Convention will be appointed for three weeks.
In addition to determining the outcome of the elections, the city electoral committee rejected the Political Party of the Russian Communists in the registration of a local referendum initiative group.
According to the documents, the parties were going to discuss the lower towns two questions: are they agreeing that the collections for multi-housing houses should be " cancelled immediately" and the tariffs for housing-communal services "frozen until 2020".
However, Irina Maslova, a lawyer, explained that the treatment of the Russian Communists was contrary to legislation.
The FedEx earnings have a mixed nature, reduced forecasts for 2016.
The FedEx reported the uncomfortable results of the last quarter, and the giant delivery service reduced the annual profit forecast due to the decline in demand for freight services and the increase of costs in its land transport unit.
The company also stated that it planned to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
At the same time, last year, the FedEx reported that it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for holidays.
Its shares were approximately 2,5 per cent in preliminary trades 45 minutes before the market was opened on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that it plans to earn from $10.40 to $10.90 in the financial year, which ends next May, by 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts suggested $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The reduction of the projection is observed despite the average rate of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and the increase of the collections for land transportation of heavy or retail goods starting in November.
The company stated that it remained planning to increase the earnings in comparison with the last year by reducing costs, increase in gross income and rising online trade.
The President and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company " worked stablely in view of the weak, compared to the forecast, economic conditions, especially in production and world trade " .
The workforce plans for holidays were announced the next day after the competitive statement, UPS, that they plan to hire more than 95,000 employees, as were taken to work last year.
For a quarter ended on 31 August, the FedEx earned 692 million dollars, 6 per cent more than a year earlier.
The share income amounted to $2.42 close to the average projection of $2.44 for the stock conducted by Zacks Investment Research in the 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six Zacks analysts suggested $12.23 billion.
The FedEx has been affected in recent years of decline in the emergency international transport sector, resulting in the lack of gross income in its express-traffic units.
However, the shopping boom on the Internet has improved the results in the FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land transport income increased by 29 per cent, but the operating revenue remained totally unchanged due to increased costs for large dispatch and self-insurance.
The Transport Expression Unit received higher income due to higher base rates, while the commodity sector declined due to increased labour costs.
In preliminary trades, about an hour before the FedEx stock market was opened, it fell by $3.85 or 2.5 per cent - up to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday by falling by 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the record of 11 June.
At the most expected meeting in a few years, the Federal Reserve System leaders will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table from the Hondurasian red tree, deciding whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end, a richly decorated room for meetings, at two floors above them, will be a sharp picture of the United States.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve System, Janet L. Yelen, and her colleagues, should place the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank has received a double assignment from the Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and maintain stable prices.
But since the Great Recession, the Federal System's leaders recognized that there was also a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third assignment may be an unknown factor in the almost predicted decision to be announced on Thursday, whether the United States economy is ready to evade the unprecedented incentive provided by a nearly zero short-term interest rate from the end of 2008.
Even though the majority of data shows a certain growth in the economy, recent financial market shocks can also prevent the Federal System from adding volatility by increasing the base rate on federal funds, even at a quarter of a percentage point.
" Clearly, labour and inflation market will become the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsay M. Pegza, the chief economist of the broker company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise the rates that increased uncertainty around the world market enough to give them an excuse to wait further," she noted.
There is no consensus on what they will do in the Federal Reserve System, which by itself provokes the deficiencies of the financial market.
Approximately half of the economists recently questioned Bloomberg had predicted an increase in the interest rate this week.
The financial markets, however, expect the Federal System to stop this, while the key indicator shows only about 30 per cent of the probability of rapid rising.
This could lead to a decline in the market of shares if the Federal System raised the rate, provided that those who make decisions would not mitigate the promise that the next increase would be short.
On Tuesday, the Dou-Johns index rose by 228,89, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599.85.
The explosion was arising from the expectations that those who define the Federal System Strategy would leave a bet this week,” said John Lonski, the chief economist of the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It will be a surprise if the Federal System increases rates at this time," he noted.
If the leadership of the Federal Reserve System does so, " they will have to go far into the approval of their strategy to keep the financial markets in their hands so that they do not panic."
Other experts objected that the increase in the rate could relieve the financial markets, as this would remove uncertainty about how the Federal System would act.
A month ago, the Federal System seemed to be inclined to raise a 0.25 per cent rate in this month, making the first small step in slowly reinforcing financial conditions, which could reaffirm the strength of the United States recovery.
Yelen stated in the spring and early summer that she was expecting to increase the rate this year, despite the complaints of Liberals that the economic progress was needed.
While new jobs had slowed in August, labour market growth was stable this year.
Unemployment decreased to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest rate in over seven years, and almost at the level that the Federal System considers full employment.
Increasing salary shows signs of acceleration.
And while the inflation continues to be below the annual indication by the central bank of 2 per cent, the Fed system ' s leadership stated that the key cause was the temporary impact of oil prices.
The economy " could deal with higher rates, and it is needed, taking into account the reduction of labour market," observed Ian Chefardson, chief economist Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of the last month, after China devaluated its currency.
The average Dou-Johns stock index for industrial companies has fallen 16 per cent of the recorded high value in May, since the investors were afraid that the slowdown of Chinese economy could stop global growth.
The market has partially restored its positions in this month, and the Dow-Johns index is now approximately 10 per cent lower than the May.
For the leadership of the Federal Reserve System, the market disturbance is further complicated with the ultimate calculations of an increase in the interest rate.
"In the absence of information about what happened on the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would be turning the gates at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher of UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former staff member of the Federal Reserve System.
Now, according to his prognosis, they will wait at least a month to get more control of the consequences.
"There is a great uncertainty about the consequences of the American economy, and they have almost no reliable data since the recent events in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not part of the main concerns of the Federal System and should not be technically taken into account in these decisions.
But in fact, the Federal Reserve System has become a global financial authority.
The Central Bank's impact has been enormous in recent years.
Only one indication from the then President Ben S. Bernanca in 2013 that the Federal Reserve System could " suppress " its cash expansion, caused market shocking throughout the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly confused, it could be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve System will not only monitor developments everywhere but also consult other Central Banks and Experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is "faster art than science," said Zakari Karabel, head of Envestnet Inc, a global management strategy.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Fed Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, pointed out this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve System there were cases of excessive reaction to the movement of the financial market, which seem to be non-related to economic principles”.
Laker, a member with the right to vote of the Influential Federal Committee on the Open Market, who insisted on an increase in the rate, presented decisions 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has led to the fact that the Federal System has reduced its base rate by 0.75 per cent for three meetings, " in spite of limited identifiable effects for growth in the United States," Laker said.
A year later, the leaders of the Federal System canceled these reductions.
The Federal Reserve System should only be placed on top of the stability of major crises, such as market failure in 2008," said Adam S. Pozen, former member of the Bank of England.
The last panic and not close to that level, he said.
"You would of course not like to be in a situation where you are frightened by the growth of the rates because the markets are experiencing a shock," said Pozen, President of the World Economy Institute, Peterson.
The Federal Reserve System Act continues to have a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and, until this changes, I don't think that it should be preceded by events.

The Spicker of the State of Sergei Narishkin believes that the United States intentionally destabilizes the situation in the Middle East so that the refugee waves will wave in Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed that view to journalists in Ulan-Bator during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a party to conspiratory theories, but the question is: Is not Europe the final objective of those who have destabilised the situation in North Africa and the Middle East in recent years?" he asked.
"Surely, someone had assumed and knew that the flows of refugees, those miserable and defeated people who were saved from death, would go to the safe countries of the EU," he added.
Nariskin wondered, "How many European political leaders have spoken frankly about the causes of this crisis, the wave of refugees, which is now literally contaminating their countries?"
"No, old Europe, except rarely, prefers to keep silent," he said.
According to Narishkin, NATO has fought many European values and standards of international law.
"The Europe has, unfortunately, long and impartially viewed and viewed how the military saphogs sewed under NATO standards are also declined by moral ideals and fundamental principles and standards of international law," emphasized the speaker.
Government forces and their loyal military formation are opposed to rebels, mainly of Islamic.
Later, a terrorist group “Islamic State” joined the opponents of the Syrian Government in Russia.
The United States supports the rebels who oppose both Asada and the IG.
The official Damascus considers such rebels terrorist.
The President of Syria referred to the cause of the hostility of the West to Russia.
The claims of the West to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign States.
This view was expressed by Syrian President Basar Assad in interview with RT, the First Channel, Russia 24, NTV, Russia today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners and sovereign States.
In those countries, he wished to remove one person and put another in place to act in the interests of the Western countries rather than for his family, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the rapid development of Western media with the beginning of the turning in Ukraine.
He said that the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, "has become from a friend of the West to the enemy, the king, the dictator, who suppressed the Russian opposition, which came to power in a non-democratic way, despite that he was elected as a result of the democratic elections recognized in the West."
Putin called on the world community to combine forces with Assad to combat the Islamic State.
Commenting on the constant statements of the West that Assad himself must leave, he noted that the President was coming to the authority by consent of the people, through the elections, and that, on the request of the people, rather than by the United States, the Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.

Broadaj called the information of the American newspaper the defamation of Arrows.
The former presidency of the Government of the Donetsk People's Republic of the Donetsk Republic, Alexander Broday, opposed the information published in the US newspaper The Washington Post.
He announced this in a telephone interview to the Lenta.ru correspondent.
The note in Washington Post is beautiful by the fact that it's all completely converted.
The former Minister of Defence, Igor Strekov, of course, had not been tied and “exited” from the territory of the Republics of Donbass in a very inclined mood, without ropes, without three funds of money that were alleged to him by different characters,” he noted.
According to Brarodaya, the talk of Arrows with the reporter of the American newspaper was really coming.
"Yes, I said that Arrowkov was urgently required to remove the Donetsk People's Republic from the territory," said the former Head of the Government of the LDC.
Broadway emphasized that he did not know why a correspondent of the American edition decided to write that the Arrows had been transported into Russia as “linked”.
I suspect it's a provocation.
If this is not a provocation, it is a surprisingly misrecognized words, since I stressed that the Arrows were leaving themselves," said Broadhai.
"It's a slander against me and on the Arrow," he concluded.
Previously on pages of The Washington Post, a article stated that he had taken Arrowkov to Russia in coercive order.
According to the publication, Brodai noted that he had been forced to link his associate.
The Polish authorities came to search for a train with the gold of Nazis.
The Polish woods came to the cutting of trees over the underground tunnel, where, according to some data, a train with the gold of the Third Raich.
The work began on Tuesday, 15 September, reports Reuters.
Military experts say that forests need to be cleared in order to verify the credibility of railways.
There may be weapons and valuable minerals within the trains.
On 31 August, the Governor of the Polish Lower Force of Thomas Smolarz (Tomas Smolarz) assumed that the new evidence of the existence of a gold train was nothing more persuasive than the previous.
However, the authorities decided to cover the search area.
Three days before that, the Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland, Peter Zuchovski, stated that local finders with “ 99 per cent probability” found the same train with the gold of the Third Raich, as described in the legends.
Fühovski noted that, if allegations are confirmed and the preciouss are discovered, they will become the property of a public penalty and that treasures will not be transferred to Russia.
In the mid-August, two legal clients contacted the authorities of the Poland city of Walbjich with a report that the train was found in a closed tunnel at a depth of 70 meters.
The chief narcoticist of RF suggested that tobacco sell to persons before 21 years.
The Russian chief drugologist suggested that the sale of tobacco should be banned until 21 years.
Eugene Brune noted that before that age, "every psychoactive substance is tobacco, alcohol, drugs, has been particularly harmful."
He said directly in the radio station “Speaking Moscow”, commenting on the fact that the speaker of Saupheda Valentine Matthewnko supported the idea of prohibiting the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21 years.
A man grows up unbalanced.
You can serve in the army since 18 years, a person is physically ready to do so.
He's been mentally prepared for full life in society since he was 21 years old.
"It is known from the scientific data that the brain, its biochemia is definitely mature until 21 years," Brune noted.
Previously, a member of the Public Chamber and the Head of the Project of Treawa Russia, Sultan Hamzaev reported " Notifications " , that Matthewnko supported the initiative to increase the age price in the sale of alcohol and " agreed with the Public Chamber to re-establish this issue at the top of the parliamentary chamber " .

The Bible has been asked to verify the information protection law
The inhabitant of Novosibirska requested the Regional Prosecutor to verify the Bible under the Federal Law on the Protection of Children against Information that causes harm for their health and development," a reporter of Sib.fm presented a statement on 16 September.
On August 26, 2015, the author stated that he acquired the Bible in the Red Aspect of China, published by the Russian Bible Society in 2013.

On 16 September, a statement was made to consider the Prosecutor ' s city of Novosibirska.
The response to the inhabitant's treatment will be received within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself," commented the complainant to the correspondent Sib.fm.
Furthermore, this is a very fundamental problem that will bring the society to an end.
It will begin to read the Bible, which has not been done before.
The Brazilian Pediatric Union of Riu-Grandi promotes healthy food for breast feeders
The Brazilian pediatric organization of SPRS has developed a scandal method to convince women to be fully nutriented during breastfeeding: the method implies the demonstration of infant breast paintings described by images of harmful food.
The breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbons, from which children receive all the food substances they need to form a strong immune system.
The high energy needs of pregnant and born women are recommended to increase the daily calories by approximately 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study showed that one increase in calority was not the only change in the diet that mothers should do.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, professor of Baylor Medical College in Texas revealed that healthy nutrition of pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, there was a negative impact of ill-feeding on the immune system of the child.
Under Hamburg, a school bus was driven by the train.
Near Hamburg, the train hit a school bus that was stuck on the railway.
A 23-year-old driver, realizing that she can't move from the railways, told 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And in a minute after that, they had a collision in their eyes.
One of the school students recorded it on the video.
The incident resulted in panic among students.
Some children began to cry and run along the side.
The route is still locked.
According to the police, no one was miraculously injured but a passenger of a train who had been injured.
The damage to the accident was estimated at EUR 300,000.
The doctors call for the ban of boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) called upon to prohibit boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown's younger.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown ended up with the traumas received in the fight against the Philippine Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles on the version of the International Box Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, which passed on Friday, was completed by the Nocauthals in the 12th Round.
Brown got in a hospital with a brain trauma.
His condition was evaluated as critical, and he was connected to the life-sustaining equipment.
At the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, only two defeats, and one fight ended destruction.
He had two children left.
This is the second case of a flight outcome among Australian boxers in the past six months.
In March, a 23-year-old Bradon Smith student died from the ring trauma.
AMA now recommends not to do this type of sport, but rather, in its view, prohibit it at all.
I understand that this is happening deliberately," said Vice-President of Steven Parnis.
But as boxes now exist, there will always be situations where a sportsman gets bleeding or brain trauma, which either leads to death or severe damage.
Therefore, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with this.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure to combine doctors and medical students.
Sergei Narishkin called on PA OSCE to cancel sanctions against RF parliamentarians.
The Spicker of the State of RF Sergei Narishkin referred to the inadmissible introduction of sanctions against parliamentarians.
He stated that, speaking at the OSCE session in Ulan-Bator.
We appreciate this as inadmissible acts, as an attachment to the value of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And this should not be repeated because it is a manifestation of political embarrassment and ignorance of the principles of open international dialogue," said the politician.
Furthermore, Narishkin called on the PA OSCE participants to restore the partnership of Russia and the EU.
Let's get the morals back to politics.
Let's return the dialogue and the right to international communication.
Let's return humanistic ideals to the democratic world.
"The duties have never ended well," he said.
Following the Tribune of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State called upon parliamentary parliamentary to convene the inter-Parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on the members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security tasks.
" First of all, the authorization of the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and immediate convening of our inter-Parliamentary group," Narishkin said.
He also noted that the OSCE should be given due.
"It is almost the only common area where it is still discussed how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," the politician stressed.
Recall, the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulan-Bator, and would extend until 18 September.
Enjoyed the victory for a couple or three days.
Peace champion of light athletic Sergei Schubenkov.
This season can be called triumphable for a 24-year-old leaflet from Barnaul Sergei SUBENKOVA.
At its coronary distance, 110 meters with barriers, he was able to win the European team's primary, set a few records and become a world champion, and the first in the history of the country's barrier sprint.
Furthermore, the sportsman recently won the final stage of the Briliant League, taking the third place in general.
The New Notifications requested that Shubenkov share the impressions of the departure season.
Sergei, is the season done for you yet?
Yes, I'm going to speak to the World War Games that will take place in Korea on October, and then I'll think about rest.
Truly, I'm going to be home right now, in Barnaule, and being home is a different condition.
It's easier than going around the world every week.
You once said the autumn is your favorite time of the year.
The end of August, the beginning of September, is a great time.
The passions after the main start of the season have been declined, the burden of responsibility is no longer pressured.
You can fight for the pleasure of the "relaxe."
Besides, you know, the vacation is very soon...
Do you have tired?
It's a special season, a mass of positive emotions...
The tiredness at the end of the season is always accumulated.
And it doesn't matter what I did, win or lose.
Each competition is stress.
Permanent flights, moves -- all of these do not pass for the body inherently.
You're getting up physically and emotional.
But now I have emotions, of course, on the rise.
I'm just happy!
Until you finished the world championship in Beijing, do you come back often?
It happens.
And you, journalists, don't let me forget it.
But at all, I think that the bad sportsman who lives with old victories is screwing his successful races over and over.
Enjoyed the victory of a couple or three days, and we have to move on.
Was preparing for this wonderful season much different from the usual?
I can't say there was something so special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter competitive season.
He trained at home in Barnaule, then at the meetings, then back home.
It's all like usual.
But the coach was asked to try to get to a new level that I haven't been on.
Almost every winter time they spent to set up the base.
A bunch of crosses, a whole-fysical training exercise, which included both the weight, and the back, and the back.
Then they took the barrier training, a lot of techniques.
Have you observed how the rivals are acting?
I'm always trying to do this. There's no problem in the Internet's age.
The winter championship of Europe was watched, and the French were taken in the barrier sprit!
I thought I had to do something, to untie this company.
With every start in this season, you add and add results.
Did that give you confidence?
I have all the recent seasons in an approximately the same scheme.
There's no way I run 13.20 first and then 13.50.
I always turn my shape in a little bit.
The main thing I wanted to do was run away from 13 seconds.
The whole work was focused first on this result.
But the paradox is that you feel like you're ready to move, but you don't always get ready at competitions.
How was that, for example, at the Olympics in London?
Honestly, the half-final race (Shubenkov) was unable to reach the final. I tried to forget it at once.
It was very good, he could really run away from 13 seconds.
Even if he repeated his best results at that point, it would be a bronze season of Games.
But it wasn't lucky.
Do you remember your first world championship?
How about that?
It was in Tag.
I really wanted to get into the finals then, it was such a maximum program.
And he's gone right from tomorrow, in the preliminary races.
Then I realized that breaking and breaking your head means not getting anywhere.
Two years later, the world champion in Moscow was already at the final with the best time.
I remember my feelings in the face of the race. I've been very happy to win the gold!
How does the proper speed, not to lose your head, be able to turn off?
And this is the most complicated thing.
You need to be very careful, focused on the technology to prevent barriers.
I noticed that when you're not on the result, it's much easier for the process.
And it's the greatest thing when you feel like you're running, and it's like you're doing it!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the depth after their first major successes strive to move closer to the capital.
Haven't there ever been such thoughts?
It's better at home anyway.
I don't know where I'm without my coach, who needs me?
Maybe it would be good to have better conditions, but I'm trying to be satisfied with what I have.
How long have you been together with Klevzov?
Since I was 12 years old, since I came to a light athletic.
More specifically, I first trained with his wife who worked with children, and then she passed me.
I started with a sprint, then jumped in a long length, triple.
The child's boarding was when the ball is thrown, jumping to the length of the place...
When I was 14, I tried to run with barriers, and I liked it.
Since the first race, the second grown-up standard has been implemented.
That's what he's left.
There's never been fear of barriers?
Someday I got to make a deal with them.
But the technique has always had to work very much.
It's just how much tormented!
But there's nothing to do with this routine.
Technology has to be retracted constantly, so I could wake up at night, I got up and ran through barriers.
Everyone who saw your race in Beijing claims it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I usually don't look at my races, and I couldn't keep it up here.
But the efficiency must continue - no limits of perfection.
Don't you fear that the winning year before the Olympic games will lie on your shoulders with a heavy load?
As they say in such cases, I will try to justify the expectations.
If I chose this road, I have to go to the end.
My coach likes to say, "If you're not weak, you don't have to feel any extra goods.
And I totally agree with him.
Otar Kushanashville
Well, I'm not so naive to be surprised by the response to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are insulted, I understand they don't feed their bread.
And even though I didn't get a flag, the same thing I said, a million times here, and I didn't call anyone a dire asshole, I was hit by another.
All my pseudo-friends got out for a second.
Pressing that I'm subjected to is so strong that even I, who has produced the types of boys, think people are white.
It's like walking, walking, and you've been attacked by a crowd, and you're mutuating with sticks.
But you need to know me, I'm not a bedroom eagle, I'm shocked, I'm old, guys, afraid.
The other thing is no support.
I haven't had any illusions, and now...
The best thing in me was self-sufficient, so you should eat.
And giving passports to such as Fred Derst or Monson, only assholes can.
I'd rather, the best journalist, work is embarrassed.
A week ago, in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili dramatically described the Crimeal Events:
What they did with the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call anxie.
I believe that the reference to how the drunk Kruchchev tried to sign something is not incorporated into a common picture of human living.
It's like coming to the neighbor and picking up his place...
The war from Kremlin went, and it will end only there.
I'm almost 100% sure, like the summer of 2008, she started calling some Kremlin bastard.
I have a guess who this could be...
Cobzon doesn't have much to live.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin's hands.
Is he gonna lose the apartment?
Well, they took him a monument.
Of course, people remembered him as an insulting little family.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovic.
Sunrise Seventh leads in the rating despite the attempts of the Ninth to light the loss of leaders in Today's Show
The exit of Carl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to light the consequences of the Liberal Party's statement on the release of the leader's position has not been able to raise a high rate of todayy.
The show of the Ninth show was transmitted from the capital of the State after Malcolm Turnbull, Tony Abbott.
The contest - Sunrise - with the leaders of David Koh and Samantha Armitage, was stuck in London within a weekly series of international broadcasts, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This torture seemed to have no big importance for Australian televizors, whereas the Sunrise audience had 397,000 audiences in five largest cities compared to today's audience in 339,000.
Today it was a little higher than on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today, the Sunrise breakdown has been reduced in recent months.
In August today there were 318 000 compared to 330 000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the breakfast declined between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, in September Sunrise has 349,000 perspectives against 314,000 today.
That's the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, boys!
Carl and Lisa are all right, thank you for clarifying!
ToDAY was published on Monday, 14 September 2015.
The important news for the Seventh was the excellent debate of 800 Words with the former star of the Packed to the Rafters Eric Thompson.
A new drama on the recently widow's father of the family, who decided to move to New Zealand to the coast with his two children, gathered an impressive audience in 1.219 million viewers.
The critics were thinking if Thompson could handle the popular show alone without the Rafters star of Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result is a loud answer yes.
The X Factor of the Seventh remained in strong positions with the audience 1,136 million, easily circulated the Block (838,000) and TBL families (726,000).
For the Seventh, luck and failure were mixed on the second evening of Chase Australia.
The first half hour (which was 17:00 to 17:30) of the new television led by Andrew O'Keefe was gathered by 446,000 viewers.
The second half of the hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) has jumped to 623,000 perspectives -- enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of Chase Australia gathered 520,000 perspectives, and the second half an hour was over 720,000.
Hot Seat collected 620 000.
The fall of the ratings of Chase Australia for the second evening will make the Ninth quietly admit that the Hot Seat would dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is a Million Dollar Minute replacement, which has failed to play the McGuire show.

Three finalists are unanimous that Sam Wood is a perfect guy, but who will he choose?
Is the secret disclosed?
Lana Jevon-Fellouse, Sarah McKay and Snowy Marcosky may have accidentally figured out who will win the Holostic.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually stay in Holostic is surrounded by a secret curtain.
And the three of the girls who came to the final, of course keep silent about who was the last rose of the girl.
But when we met Sarah McKay, Snowy Marcosky and Lana Jevons-Fellouse before the day the three girls had to stay two, they might have unfortunately gave a tip about the winner.
Sam Wood keeps silence till the final, which will be held on Thursday.
All three women are in a lyric mood, telling why Wood is a perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, purpose, family values, living joy as the reasons for which each of them would be happy to become his satellite.
But by their answers to the question, "If not you, who should get the last rose of Wood?" they could not be able to tell who of them actually conquered the heart of the Hollow.
Jeffons Fellows and Markoski, without doubt, called McKay the perfect couple for Wood.
Sarah and Sam have had a good relationship since the first day.
"Of the moment I got participants, I felt the energy and energy of Sam and realized that they were very suitable, and I had no doubt over the whole show," said Jeffens-Fellouse.
"Sara is a very open man, with it easy and fun," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and there's a really attraction between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood will be a great couple.
McKay herself said that because of her home dates last week, she realized that Wood might be the "hey man".
"When I saw him among my friends and family, I realized that it was not just a game -- I trusted him with all my heart," she said.
On the question who the Woodo should be elected, if it wasn't her, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same way, and Snow and Lana are equally worthy of it.
The Bachelor shows out on Wednesday at 19:30 on channel Ten.

Jarrid Hayne had several options to start his career in NFL.
Detroit and Seattl were very interested in his relocation to the United States, as well as many other clubs that sent requests after the impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hane chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Thomsul and it seems to be a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the backyard for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former player of the Australian League of ragby allowed at the first return of the pant in a victory game with Minnesota with the account of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another opportunity to return the pant and also initiated him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Thomsula showed himself on the good side and after the game, in the dressing room.
Instead of offering new ones in the presence of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hane at the press conference after the match.
The Special Reporter of the Club 49ers Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also supported by the Special Team Coordinator of Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget the lost ball and to think about the next game.
Jarrid Hayne lost the ball back by the Minnesota Wakings team during the first quarter.
At the beginning of the debut in NHL Hayne and its numerous Australian worshippers were obviously not counting on.
It was seen Hayne arguing when he left the field after the loss of the ball, and later he told the leading Hamish and Andy show at the Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't imagine a more unfortunate start of his career in the NFL.
"It happens, you're just thinking about the next game," said Hayne.
Hayne compared his failure with the debut in the 2007 Origin games, when the ball drop in its starting zone was attempted to Queensland.
Finally, this experience was very useful for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne took pictures with the Australian flag and fans after the game and put a picture in Instagram.

The Russian recognized the greatest cyber attack in the U.S. history.
The prosecutor of the largest cyber-attack of the United States, Vladimir Drinkman, admitted to stealing more than 160 million credit cards, reports Reuters.

During the telephone conversation with the head of the Russian MID, Sergei Lavrov Secretary of the United States, John Kerry, warned that the support of Russia for the Syrian President Bashar Asad had accelerated the conflict in the country.
"Secretary Kerry made it clear that the support of Russia, President Asada, risks accumulation and enlargement of the conflict, as well as undermine our common goal to combat extremism if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power," said the report published on the US State Department website.
Kerry reaffirmed the commitment of the United States to combat the grouping of the Islamic State (which is prohibited in Russia by the Supreme Court) as a coalition of more than 60 States.
According to the Secretary-General, Assad " will never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
During the telephone conversation, Carrie also stressed that the conflict in Syria could only be resolved by political transition from Asada.
In the White House, Russia was threatened by isolation because of the support of the Assad regime.
Before the press secretary of the White House, Joshua Ernest threatened Russia by isolation unless it stopped supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed to join an international coalition that conducted an anti-terrorism operation against the Islamic State.
The media have recently reported the presence of Russian troops in Syrian territory.
The head of the Russian MID, Sergei Lavrov, stated that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and have been helping Syrians to conquer the technique to apply it against Islamians.
Four died when the police opened a shooting with a tire bullet on protesters in Nepal.
Four men, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in South Nepal when the police started shooting with a guinea bullet in a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution of the country, as the official representative said on Wednesday.
Violence took place on Tuesday night in Rupandei County, about 175 miles west of Katmandu, the capital of the country.
Bišnu Prasad Dakal, head of the District Police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters were gathered at one of the police departments, some dropped stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dacal reported that the police used a tear gas, then shot the air before the rubber bullets were launched.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is irregular why the rubber bullets that are known to be killed, but traditionally used as a less mortal alternative, caused such high mortality.
This conflict was last in a few weeks of severe protests in the southern, equation of Nepal, where the representatives of the population of Madesia claimed that the new provinces of the new constitution would reduce their political impact.
The protests also passed in the western Nepal, among the nationals of the Tarus who wished to have their state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in cruel conflicts, starting with 10
On August, when four major political parties signed the country ' s separation agreement in the province, which has become a crucial step towards the new constitution, however, a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centralised for several centuries.
The work on the new constitution has been carried out since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that took thousands of lives in April.
The legislators voted for articles of the draft Constitution in Catmandu this week, and the officials stated that the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create an enterprise at 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkut region.
It was built in the 70s of the past century as a chemical industry centre, has a developed infrastructure that requires systemic support.
A year ago, Sayansk was headed by the new Mayor Oleg Borovski.
The result of the first year of work, the new projects and perspectives he told the correspondent " District " .
Oleg Valerjevich, why did you start working as mayor?
I first learned the results of the financial and household checks, and I initiated an independent public expertise on the expenditure of local budgets.
A municipal property audit was then conducted.
One of the first practical steps was the reduction of documentation to five days.
Previously, institution papers could have been walking for months.
Actions to increase the income base and to optimize costs have been developed.
In November last year, a Government ' s meeting held in Sayansk, which addressed the issues of socio-economic development of the Territory.
There was no project-count documentation (PSD) in the city.
Without that, Saiyansk could not participate in federal programmes.
We started training PSDs for roads, child gardens, northern sewer collector and water.
The road work in the two stations is now ongoing.
How does the city comply with the order of the President of the RF to build gardens?
In July this year, 105 children were born in Sayansk.
Such positive demographic has not been observed in the city for the last 27 years.
So the question of the places in children's gardens is one of the most important things today.
From 1 September, the capital repair of 10 children was closed for 320 seats.
The cost of repair is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds.
Last year after the repair, a child garden No. 23, which is now visiting 200 children, was opened.
The repair was made under the conditions of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, which amounted to more than 67 million rubles.
As a result of the efforts of the administration and assistance of the district Government, funds were made to purchase furniture and equipment, and the “National Initiatives” programme also helped.
There are plans to start building a new child garden in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the sequence of children aged between 1,5 and 3 years of age.
We don't have a row for children from three to seven years.
Are investors interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that the construction of the city should be done, primarily, by the Sayanic enterprises, that is what it needs to be done.
The 60 orphans' home for orphanages in Leningradian micro-range has already been issued in October.
With regard to construction, I would add that Saiyansk was one of the four Priangarian cities, which had entered the programme for accommodation of accommodation.
All the necessary documentation is prepared.
The building of 90 blocks will begin soon.
We allocated the construction of 10,000 square m of accommodation to participate in the programme.
One of the conditions is that the housing must not be worth 30,000 rubles per one square meter, which includes the key section.
If we deal with the amounts given, we will continue to participate in the programme.
With regard to investors, we have other interesting projects.
In time, the Saian pig complex was built in the territory, which was sold for a priceless sale in 2004.
We're working with the prosecutor's prosecution.
More than that, the land is in federal property.
Work with Moscow is addressed by the issue of transfer of 88 ga to area property, followed by the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor ready to invest in the reconstruction and launch of a project of 1,5 billion rubles.
We're going to have 900 jobs with a pig-complex rifle, which will be a big backup for the city.
Is the Institute of Social Partnership developed in Sayansk?
We have ordered 140 socio-economic partnership treaties.
Many projects have been implemented through the active social position of business representatives.
Encouraging support is provided by enterprises such as the Eastern Centre, the New Winter Technology, OOO "Sayanic Numberler", OOO "PC MDF", the leadership of these enterprises has been responding to all requests.
Directly to the OOC Day, the Saiaan numberer gave the city a small town, and the East Centre repaired the horse palace, where specialists were working with children in therapy, spent more than 1 million rubles.
As a result of the sponsorship, the city of ZAHS has been well-established.
The sponsors helped to mark the Day of the city.
As in old times, there was a paradise with urban collectives and organizations.
The latter of the city, the book of the Sayan poets, was released.
The first buildings and people who have contributed seriously to the development of Sayanska have provided jubilee medals.
Advocates also participate in the urban charitable fund.
The first step was to acquire tools for young talented musicians.
In nine months, more than 800,000 rubles are aimed at supporting talented children, helping children needing expensive treatment, supporting children from poor families.
How are staff problems dealt with in the social sphere in Sayansk?
There are no doctors and teachers in the city.
Professional housing is of great importance to deal with the staffing issue.
In the past year, we allocated five accommodations for doctors, and we received four teachers.
We have a housing programme to privatize it in five years.
The plan is to replant a building that will build eight more educational apartments.
The teachers and doctors are also involved in the Russian family livelihood programme.
In the prospect of building a house for budget workers.
The most important thing is that there is a working team in the city with which I can deal with the most difficult issues.
It is important that all the crises make the right conclusions and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is large.
In Dumu, a draft legislation on the indexing of socpensions was introduced, taking into account the increase in prices.
The State has introduced a draft law which provides for the indexing of social pensions each year from 1 February, taking into account the increase in prices.
The author of the document, the Deputy of Just Russia, Alexander Lomakin-Rumanians, also suggests an additional pension index on 1 April, if the rate of residential minimal growth exceeds the rate of price increase in goods and services.
The indexing of socpensions, according to existing legislation, is produced annually from 1 April, taking into account the growth of the retirement minimum in the RF for the past year.
The draft law incorporated into the Lower Chamber provides for the introduction of social pension indexing, taking into account consumer price growth rates.
The first indexing shall be carried out on 1 February and the second shall be held on 1 April.
PA OSCE head said that Mogerini was inadmissible to introduce sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the Supreme Representative of the European Union on Foreign Affairs of the Federation, Mogerini, a speaker of PA OSCE Ilkka Canerva stated that sanctions against legislators involved in the Assembly activities were inadmissible.
A member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of PA OSCE in Ulan-Bator Nikolay Kovalev informed the journalists.
According to TASS, signs of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, have been gathered in support of the position of Canerva.
"The strong support has already been formed," said Kowalev.
He previously stated that the head of the OSCE had intended to collect signatures of the deputies that indicated the inadmissibility of the introduction of sanctions against parliamentarians.
In particular, noted Kowalev, Canerva pledged to raise this problem to the level of the European Union's governing structures and to " send the relevant petition " .

Google launches a doubling campaign for the collection of 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the launch of a doubling campaign to collect $111 million for humanitarian organizations that helped capture the European countries of refugees who fled from the ruined war and merger countries.
Google used a non-specific personal approach to announce the campaign for donations in its blog.
Instead of making a statement by one of the leaders, Google Rita Masud, who fled with the Cabul family when she was seven, described her personal experience.
"We've been on suspicious trains and buses, famine, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But since the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has increased, many people such as my family are desperately needing help.
The sacrifices will be submitted to four non-commercial organizations assisting refugees and migrants: " Doctors without borders", the International Rescue Committee, the Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million of donations until the amount on the google.com/refugeerelief would reach $11 million.
Europe opposes the strongest crisis with refugees since the Second World War, caused by a majority of the four-year civil war in Syria, which resulted in more than four million people in this year.
Many also flee from wars covered by Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with little fatty may help to surgery for fatty
A good effect after surgery of fatty in people with a small abnormality of type 2 may take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still early to claim that diabetes with a little fatty live longer after the surgery of fatty than those who receive non-surgery treatment.
"The mortality statistics are not manifested at once," stated Dr. Robin Blackstone, an explorer for obesity surgery, who wrote on a new study in the column of the JAMA Surgery editor.
The obesity surgery, or bariary surgery, uses various methods to reduce the abdominal size.
They reduce the hunger and limit the ability of the body to adopt food.
In a few years, bariatrial surgery has demonstrated its effectiveness to treat type 2 diabetes, but basic studies were conducted among people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (IMT) 35 or higher.
The IMT, the weight measure relative to growth, is considered normal with the value of 18.5 to 24.9.
IMT 25 or above indicates that human weight is excessive and that people with IMT above 30 are considered abundant.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, the researchers from the Taiwan hospital Min-Sheng General have used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatrial surgery - stomach shuffling and sleeping of sleeves, with medical treatment of diabetes of type 2 in people with small fatty.
The average IMT in those subjected to surgery has fallen from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, IMT remains at approximately 29 levels of non-surgery treatment.
Among those who passed the surgery, 36 per cent were fully cured, and partially 28 per cent.
For comparison, a total diabetes treatment was observed only in 1%, and partially in approximately 2%.
In addition, the blood pressure indicators, triglycerides and " bad " PLNP cholesterol " were " better generally in the surgery group," the authors stated.
Researchers also controlled the levels of A1s hemoglobin in the blood that reflect blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better retained below 7%, according to researchers.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c decreased from approximately 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable at approximately 8 per cent.
However, the best Glycaemic Control indicators reflected by good levels of hemoglobin A1c did not reduce mortality in five years, according to Dr. Chicheng Su and colleague research manager.
The research group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, compared to the sleeve group, the shunting group lost more weight (18.7 kg against 14.2 kg), increased decrease in IMT (7.4 against 5.1) and A1s hemoglobin (3.1 per cent against 2.1 per cent) and was closer to the full remission of diabetes (46.9 per cent against 16.7 per cent).
While a new study does not show the benefits of the surgery for life after five years, there are confirmations of people with excessive body mass in Sweden, that surgery treatment is indeed leading to an increase in life-life, as reported by Blackstone from the Medical College at Mr. Phoenix, Arizona University.
According to the Swedish study, the probability to die for 15 years was approximately 29 per cent below compared to the group in which more traditional methods were used.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life, Blackstone noted that this encouraged people with IMT below 35 interested in this procedure.
"The report here is very important, as it claims that such surgery is safe in a low IMT group where there is no increased risk of mortality or kidney diseases," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should be taking weight seriously as soon as the IMT of the patient reaches the range between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long to make people take this seriously," she said.
I think that as soon as they accumulate genetic changes that start denseness and diabetes in their bodies, it's very difficult to turn it back.
Thieves were taken out of the house and 9 million rubles.
In the Mistishes, the robbers were attacked by the inhabitants of the underwealth house and stole 9 million rubbers and three female shakes.
The Interfax is informed of this with reference to the MDF press service.
The incident happened Tuesday morning.
Two strangers entered the house on the street of Gorky, tied the 20-year-old son to the house, and threatened with both knives, abducted 9 million rubles and three chubs.
According to preliminary data, the damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case on the article “Deployment”.
The European fans are risking to become homeless.
Only 23 Petersburg hotels have the right to place tourists who will come to the World Championship in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are still in a hurry to receive the appropriate permission.
Experts believe that this is a very disturbing sign.
At the outset of the world's privilege, the authorities will urgently have to figure out how to displace all the visitors of the city.
Rosbalt's interviewers believe that the cost of rental apartments would increase by 10 to 30 per cent because of the tournament, and after the championship for retail housing will have to be repayed.
The soccer championship forced the authorities to pay attention to the state of the Russian hotels.
According to the law written specifically under the primary authority, each Petersburg Hotel should take a classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the reported number of stars and service level.
It is clear that it will not be possible for all of us: the hotels are so afraid of checks that they often don't even send documents to the requests of the Federal Anti-Monopolity Service on Petersburg.
As UFAS head Vadem Vladimirov said, the department studied 138 hotels and now plans to establish 34 cases on hotels, many of which simply did not respond to anti-monopolists.
There are signs that the leadership of three dozens of companies has deceived citizens by placeing a number of stars in the advertisement, noted Vladimirov.
The problem is that there are literally any numbers on the account, no one can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the soccer championship, the cheerleader will take all Petersburg hotels.
At present, tourists can count at 30.5 thousand numbers in the city.
According to Smolny, in Petersburg, 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotel, 100-two-star and three-star, 550-star.
According to the first Deputy Committee on Tourism for Nana Guitia, only 23 hotels had been classified at the moment, so many checks were conducted in Petersburg.
However, whether any hotel had ordered such a procedure in regional enterprises, the Smollian on the surprising gain of circumstances, is unknown.
I mean, past classifications may be more, but no one knows about it.
"The last six months of the hotels have not been very struggling for classification," recognised Director of the North-West Division of the Russian Union tourism, Ecatherina Shadska.
This is due to a high season during which hotels earn most money and do not want to deal with other matters.
Another reason is the budgets in which no verification costs have been established, and the procedure may cost a hotel depending on the status of 30 to 100 rubles and more.
Nevertheless, recently, hotel managers have been intensified and applied for classification, as assured by Shadow.
Hotels have to make it before 1 July 2016, otherwise they will not only pay fines but also have no right to work for the world's championship.
It is already known that, depending on starliness, a fixed pay for the hotel during the tournament.
The formulas for which the value will be calculated will be published next year.
This was made to prevent prices of 200-300 per cent, for example during the Petersburg Economic Forum.
There must be a conscience and not to allow increases to be made twice or three times, but also the hotels must be earned.
"I think growth will be up to 50 per cent," explained President of the Russian Hotel Association, Gennady Lamshine.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov was not sure that price fixation was in line with the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how much this is under the economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It's better than an uninterrupted journey," he noted.
I don't know what's going to happen to popular cheap hosts.
The Deputies of the State have introduced a bill that prohibits hostels in housing houses.
We hope that this law will not be adopted or affected by Petersburg.
"We will stand to the point of view that hostels should be preserved," says Nana Guachia.
However, she said that the owners of the hotels should, in any case, be prepared to reinforce the Housing Code.
If the State approves the bill, approximately 80 per cent of the hostels will be closed in Peterburg, and at the moment there are 1,5,000 numbers.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurants and Hotels, Northwest Leonida Garbara, there are two and three-star hotels in Petersburg, which are just needed by football chefs, but there are a crossing to the four- and five-star hotels.
Similar to the situation of the situation where "seats 75,000 via in the 80,000 stadium."
This can be corrected by the mini-hotels.
Their possible ban considers the "idioticism," "I think it's weird that some people can live in apartments, but there's something they can't come."
If the hostel is used as a living room, I agree that it's wrong.
But if it's like a hotel where the guests are arriving for a short time, why not?
The mini-hosts are risking to miss the soccer championship of the world and because of their improperity.
All hundreds of small hotels just won't be able to pass the classification, and they're sneaking themselves.
By summer 2016, all hotels will be ordered.
"Companies that can carry out this procedure are not much, so they will refuse less payable orders from mini-hotels and will be chosen by those who travel," said Gennadius Lamshine, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the verification rates of the verifications that have been conducted at present are significantly higher than the Peterburgh.
The reason for the delay in Petersburg is that the Government's tourist bloc has been constantly interrupted, which does not contribute to the coherent work.
Experts believe that if the Petersburg hotels are not enough, it is probably necessary to pay attention to the district hotels and homes.
Like Petersburg's 300-year celebration, a river fleet could be mobilized, namely, tournament guests will be able to live in cabins.
Furthermore, many cheerleaders will be prepared to come on trucks where they can stay.
"The main thing is not to set the hotels so that they leave," Gennadi Lamshine is sure.
A large popularity will also be used during football primary housing.
Probably in the city, there will be a reservation of landing apartments.
The rental rates will increase by 10 to 30 per cent.
"Out of the apparent - first will be accommodation near the stadium," noted the Agency ' s rental and research in the real estate of Laris Bragin.
The rent price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in bedroom areas.
It will also contribute to the construction of new transport solutions in the regions of the city, she stressed.
We should not forget the human qualities of the towns.
For example, Leonid Garbar is convinced that Petersburg was always a guest city in which people can not only indicate the road but also conduct a mini-excursion.
There are complications.
In 1970, my father met a family from Murmansk, father, mother and two children in the courtyard.
They had nowhere to stay: the hotels were difficult at that time, and sleeping at the station was hard.
"And Dad brought them to our municipal apartment to sleep," the interviewer recalled.
Truly, he added that in the city, there is no such qualities to be called inherent consequences and scary at home.
But, in 2018, will the State's failures of hotels and governments have to remember the past?
The Turinov "slill" of the Amur region.
He was excited today at the Klounade of Girinovski in the State.
He did such things when our generation was only learning to trade in newspapers, and it is still in a beautiful shape.
The theme of the presentation, perhaps, is "the LDPR Protest against the results of the elections in the Amurian area".
Protocols do not tremble, for nothing; other protocols other than the electoral signed by LDPR, apparently, have no.
He raises the second seat of Ivan Abramov and screams something like, "This is the winner of the elections!"
And at the same time, he's ripping out on his family, and then, after the chairman's breakfast, he's pulling a fraction from the meeting room, and literally shouting, "You're all with the fronts of your cheats and thieves."
The press, of course, gives emphasis not on Abraham, but on the scandal and demarche of fractions as a result of this scandal and insult.
Really, Wolfovic had a beautiful and elegant way of combining the Amur area with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is a regular turnover of Girinovski in the form of " Doddy!", and not at all the protest of the political party against the results of the specific elections.
The fraction has also been formally scandalized, and the elections, if you believe the party's website and the Facebook of Ivan Abrahamov, are not recognized, but the leader is obviously coming down.
It represents the dead in the Amure to bury their dead themselves, and itself preaching the Gospel against the "Jedine Russia" as a whole and none of the good family.
An excellent decision to avoid losing either the person, not to the present, rather than the scandal.
Another thing that is now in a strange situation is the same as Abramov.
In addition to the chief scream, he had nothing to wait for; there were no alternative protocols on his hands.
He was not focused on public attention, on the one hand, but on the other, for the narrow circle, he became the formal cause and to insult the respected championship, and that even more coolly, the Champician cases were addressed to the ER and UNF.
And then, of course, he needs to think seriously about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of elections, policy number 2 of the region and candidate No. 1 to the only area united district, it can become a pair that has successfully benefited from its own party leadership and super irritator for the same UNF and the party leadership of the alien.
Surely, there would be no Gerinovsky, but it should be invented and respectfully observed.
The tramp is growing and growing before it.
The news was that the LDPR would return to the hall during the next plenary.
I mean, the bath has fallen out of nothing.
Only Abraham's theme was buried under it.
It's really beautiful.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe." - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, said Dalaj-lama, adding that the real solution of the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the cessation of violence in refugee countries.
Dalai Lama addressed the continuing refugee crisis in its speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Centre in Oxford on ethics studies at the beginning of its 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that, in existing circumstances, the interests of mankind should be higher than the interests of individual countries or even the continents.
He also emphasized that, although this is amazing, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was not adequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
While Dalaj-lama highly responded to the actions taken by Germany and Austria in relation to the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"The concern of thousands of refugees is great, but at the same time you must also think of the long-term decisions, how to bring the present world and the development, mainly through education, in those Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we must think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Talking about violence, Dalaj-lama also commented on George Bush's actions after terrorist acts 11/11, saying that the United States ' s severe response launched a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in the letter to President Bush and told him that the problem could be solved by non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used power, and that caused the unexpected consequences," Dalaj-lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have absorbed the disinfecting tool for hand over the past four years
Toxicological centres in the United States reported a almost 400 per cent increase, starting since 2010, the number of children under 12 years of age has absorbed a disinfecting tool with high-spirit content, according to the toxicological centre of Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgian Toxicological Centre, children were swallowed up to 12 years of liquid for the disinfection of hands reported in toxicological centres, from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"The children contact these substances more often, and unfortunately, some per cent of them are sent to the ambulance office," said Lopes CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfective liquid specially, and some do so to impress their friends or dispute for social networks.
Youthube videos show how teenagers drink disinfecting liquid as cheap drinking.
Adolescents reportedly mixed disinfecting liquid with a spirt containing liquid for lips to get a stronger drink.
Children of a younger age may attract nice smells of disinfecting liquid.
"The child doesn't think it could hurt him," said Lopez.
Many of the most attractive (disinfecting liquids for hands) are those who are smelled.
There are disinfecting liquids for hands with a smell of jaгодs, grapes, oranges that are very attractive for children.
The disinfecting liquid for hands contains some 45 to 95 per cent of spirt.
In particular, a number of drying children may cause alcoholic poisoning.
"It is a high-concentrated alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Steven Thornton, chief toxic centre at the University of Kansas.
You wouldn't just leave a whiskey like that, but people are looking at these disinfecting tools for hand, and if children get to them, it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a disinfecting tool in the school with a turbulent smell, was sent to the ambulance.
The level of alcohol in her blood was 179, twice as much as the adult who, according to the law, was considered to be alcoholic, Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her in the Gwinnett medical center near Atlanta.
Naija was confused and could not walk when she was delivered to the ambulance.
The doctors observed her all night in a separate childhood clinic to avoid missing any signs of brain trauma, since the girl fell down and hit her head, told Ritchie.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, Naigi's mother.
This could have been deadly for my child.
Lopes recommended that parents and teachers use non-spiritous substances or disinfecting ulcers, in addition to remove disinfective liquids from the child's achievement zone.
In addition to alcoholic poisoning, some disinfecting liquids link deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after they absorbed the disinfecting substance containing a toxic unexposed ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained a metanol, a deadly agent, not an ethyl alcohol, which was indicated as an active substance.
In January, three four-class students in northern New York agreed to poison their " opposite" teachers by "proliferation of antibacterial substances in class," according to the police report.
The teacher has a strong allergy to hand disinfectors, and she has forbidden them to be held in her class.
The police believe that the unsuccessful plan was " empty talks " and addressed the issues of discipline to the school district.
As the oldest child library in Barnaule became a family club.
On the back of the barrel at the entrance to their wooden child library, N.K. Crupus is sad with a owl.
Kids who come for books are trying to feed her with candy.
For a few generations, it has been going to this library for 95 years.
The first readers in the 20s of the past century were making loud readings here, spectacles on verses of Majakovski, literature victorins and texting with Lenin's wife.
The receipt continued for four years, and as the 1939 Journal of the Young Station wrote, the “friendship between the Hope of the Constantine Crupe and the friends of the Library of Children of the city of Barnaule was increasingly strong.
Constantine’s hope even sent a picture to the farewell Barnaul friends.
And when the barnauls asked whether Constantine’s Hope would object to adopt her name to the library, she said no, no, no.
The letters have been drained in the museum long ago, and the grandchildren and the grandchildren of the first readers have to explain whose severe profile decorated the barrel in the library.
During the years of restructuring, various people often called, regretted: why is the child's library not renamed?
May there be a library of a good child writer without political color!
The libraries workers sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
"Crup" is probably the most famous and favorite library in Barnaule, such as "leniness" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library, a path from the yellow ciggle.
"The Wizard of the Famous City" is the favorite topic of Olli Moskovski.
Ola used to be a legal manager, attending work at 8 p.m., leaving at 5 p.m., and all other managers were different only by love for drawing.
And then I found an announcement on the Internet, "Illustrator for the book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" -- "My mother has cancer."
Ola was illustrating, and she thought that life could end at any time, and there will be no miracles in it if you don't create them yourself.
She is now working in the library, illustrating child books of writers around the world and composing fairy tales itself.
It is traditionally believed that children are losing interest in the book that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...
But the readers are coming to us, and their parents understand the importance of reading, says the Russian Planet Director of Tatian Kushvid library.
In recent years, we have even had such a moment of confidence that the child's library needs, and it's going to live. Kids come here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
A large exhibition visual with a updated photo exposure is hanged in the library.
Once in the neighborhood, new photographs of readers who go to the library of the whole family: Mom, Dad, and children.
The library is happy that the children have become more and more papas.
If a child was read all of the Chukovsky, he needed more books at his age.
However, there is now a law under which an eight-year-old vunderkind is not allowed to issue books from category 12+.
In order to get a book like that, the child must bring parents with them - they come, then return again, and gradually, the Crux becomes something like a family club.
There are treasures in the library - a dorevolutionary collection of jaws and eras, leading Korolenko in the annex to the " Niva" magazine, the "Mursilki" for 1936.
Because we're not just a conceptual "the temple of the book," we're now open for movement, we're trying to become a special place -- not a home, not a job, not a school -- explains Tatiana Kushvid.
You can come to us to read, play, draw.
We made a game zone for babies - the baby just comes to play, and the hand is still pulling to the book!
Some of our readers are kidnapped by parents, and they are stuck with legs, and they don't want to leave.
Mothers often come with wheels, and we are pleased that they put the library first among the rest of the places where you need to come with the babies.
Tatiana Kushvid says, modern children like us once love classical child literature:
"The publishing case is now developing, and much attention is given to the authors who are a linking bell between generations."
And when we're talking about little kids, they're important to be some kind of hero who travels from one book to another.
Children don't like to break up with their heroes.
The library keeps publishing tracts for parents in which he tells what is happening in modern child literature, which books are worth paying attention and why.
Boxes are so exciting and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is not yet for them.
It is forbidden for adults to extract books outside the read room.
This magic privilege only has children.
...In the next room of the library, there is a square hole with ancient wooden stairs in the basement, in the bookcase.
The steps will scratch under your steps - it's a very old time machine.
You meet with your childhood book like an old companion: hello, good thing we're not changing.
Ellie's still entertainingly walking on the road wet by the yellow ciggle, the Tol Rijikov laundry steals magic sticks, and the Malchish-Kibalchish never told the goddamn bourjuins of the Military Secret -- that's his strong word.
The books are like passwords, and everywhere you can know your own.
There are, for example, a prerevolutionary collection of jaws and eras in the storage and present book rareness.
Or lead Corolenco in a famous annex to the Niva magazine.
Or "Murzilki" in 1936.
Time aged the pages, painted them into tea color.
These publications are no longer published to readers.
It's the pieces of our future collection, and I dream all of it, I'm going to retire and take care of rare child books.
But the kids are not going to do that, and the colors in old books aren't very bright, and themes... you open the first page, and there's Lenin, party, comsomol.
Now it seems, "Why did we all write out this Pioneer Truth?"
But it was still interesting, tells the Russian planet, Galina Ilasova, the managing bookcare.
The Mulder pages have been dark from time to time.
Galina Vasilievna has been running a bookcare for the rest of her life.
She knows what color Buratino has, in which year Harry Potter became the captain of the Griffindor team at the Quaddich Championship, in which situations Carlson uses the pulp for the engineer, and whom the father of Alice is working.
The librarian's work is paid a little, and everyone who can live without these book lines quickly finds a different job.
Only the most persuasive: educators, teachers, servants of the book cult.
It is also known by smile - it is considered a professional character of the child's library.
If he smiles to you at the first minute of conversation, it's a professional.
I like children's books at all: as a library, I like them to stand on the shelves straight and beautifully, and I also love reading them,” says Galina Vasilevna.
I read everything: military, historical, tales, fantastic.
Reading modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think everything was different in my childhood.
The books were the most interesting and fascinating thing that happened to me then.
And since I loved them insanely, I thought the library was a magic place.
And I wanted to work where everyone sits and reads.
I hope the books will always be despite the riders.
And I'm glad when our former readers bring children, or even grandchildren...
Rumour: There is no disagreement in Seltic
Griffiths disagreed with the disagreements in Seltics after Dale's confession that Hups is in a bad situation, but he'll fix it.
Harts will protest against the claim of the Scotland Football Association to Neilson, and Warberton fears the signing of contracts in January that may violate the unity of the team.
Dons have increased the advantage of Seltik to five points.
Adam Runi's penalty in the first time gave Aberdin a small advantage over Hamilton in Pittodra, which allowed Dons to get away from Seltic for five points.
Griffiths disagreed with disagreements
This led to rumours of disagreements in the Seltic, which were interrupted by Griffits, saying that he and his team companions did not suffer from any strong criticism by preparing to meet the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel tension, I think the players are looking for it.
Dutch people are bored because there are no Scots in the fight for the title of de Burh
Former Rangers Self Defencer and former member of the Netherlands' collection, Ronald de Bour said that the Dutch Football Footballers lost their interest in Seltic because he did not compete for the title of Rangers.
De Bour, currently a representative of Ayaks, said, "The most attractive moments of the games are no longer shown in the Netherlands, and why?"
It's because there's no Rangers.
People here are not just talking about returning Rangers.
They're talking about an old company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
The "Old Company" games have a lot of tension, and not only people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I will change everything," said Dala.
Ronnie Dala acknowledged that Seltic is in difficulty, but Norwegian coach swore to change everything.
For the defeat of Malmo and, as a result, the exit of the League of Champions soon followed the loss of 10 football players Aberdina, which is now at five points, taking the top of the table.
Dala, however, said, "Selitka had bad times before, and we're going out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I understand that it's very frustrating, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
So do we, but we have to go on.
And we really need Seltica's support because this makes the players much better.
Staying together now is so important.
Warberton is untrusted about January's transfers
Despite the views that it appeared only a few weeks ago, which suggested that he had identified some of the goals of January transfers, the Chief of Rangers, Mark Warberton, was mistrustful to the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the unity of the team.
The former attacker of Brantford said, "The January Transfer Window is very different from the summer window."
With regard to the players coming in the summer, you have a period before the beginning of the season for their adaptation, which you have seen in our own group in this season.
The team works really well.
Sometimes more harm is to add unnecessary players to those you really need.
Mitch, who is interested in Seltik, suggested the completion of the career
The attacker of Swansi Mitch, connected to Seltic during the transfer window, suggested that he could leave football after his Swan contract was completed.
The 29-year-old player suffered from ice problems for two years and couldn't leave Wales this summer.
Harts are going to oppose the SFA on Neilson's statements.
"Harts" led with account 2:1 when Patterson was removed and lost 3:2, but the red protector card was cancelled later; this is the third red Collum card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson did not give up his words, saying, "I did not question ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffiths swore to avoid Tankasl.
Heibernian's stubborn player got a statement after he admitted he was singing a song with insulting words about the former Harts player, Rudy Scutzel.
The incident occurred in a pub in Roseburn region, Edinburgh, before the start of the Edinburgh derby in Tankasl in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was burning," said the attacker, adding, "I can confidently say that I was not going back to Tankasl unless he played "Seltic."
Donnelly: The Board of Tanadis is confident in the management of Dundee United
Simon Donnelly argues that the Board of Directors of Dundee UNITED remains confident that the manager team will change the situation to better, but agrees that the deterioration of the field should end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the boys to come out again," said Donnelly.
McKinnes is glad he won "Hemilton" by "Hemilton"
Derek Macinness acknowledged that his Aberdin team had to fight desperately Hamilton Assiss in order to win the seventh victory in the first of the League, which put them five points above "Seltica" on the top of the tournament table, thanks to Adam Runi's first time tool.
McInness said, "There's no team that wins anything, a cup or a League champion who didn't win a meeting like that."
The level of unemployment among Scots is not changing, whereas in the United Kingdom it grows as a whole
WHAT 164,000 people remained in Scotland for the period from May to July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
The level of unemployment in Scotland was 5.9 per cent higher than the United Kingdom at 5.5 per cent, as the UNS National Statistics Service figures showed.
At the same time, the employment in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 in three months, while the number of employees is 2,612,000.
The employment level for Scotland decreased by a quarter to 74.0 per cent, above the average of 73.5 per cent of the United Kingdom.
The Scotland Minister David Mandel, commenting on the latest figures, noted: “The Government ' s long-term plan has established the foundations for the strengthening of the economy.”
It was almost a year since Scotland decided to remain in the United Kingdom.
During these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the work market in Scotland with employment and unemployment reduction.
Why I am a witness of the execution in Oklahoma
Today, by avoiding legal interference at a later stage, I will watch the man be executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll sit on the mortal cell gallery in Oklahoma prison when Richard Glossip will be executed by a deadly injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
The first time this request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When this day came, I was afraid.
So why do you do that?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the detailed history of the death penalty.
That would offer a unique race.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since the results of the dark lottery are often more than places, the results of the dark lottery decide who will be elected.
In Oklahoma, press rooms were reduced from 12 to 5.
Whoever's chosen, he'll look at it without emotions.
I can't do that.
I will sit with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and we have a relationship with him after a few months of phone calls and one visit for two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I cannot be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I will not be allowed to take a book and pen to write what I see.
I have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter that I was acting impartial.
It's a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes, he gets access.
I complained to her.
She recognized that she could "better formulate herself," but she still believes I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with something I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he said.
I told him he could get me out of his list of witnesses any time.
But he wants an international journalist to attend there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that the volume will help the movement to cancel the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter from Haffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the subcasts I've recorded.
I'm not going to be in detail again.
I can't say with confidence that Richard Glossip is not guilty.
His actions after Barry van Treeze was murdered make him guilty of a crime aid.
But I believe there's a great probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm firmly convinced that the evidence for the death sentence was not enough.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die.
I can't say I'll be entirely objective.
There will be other reporters to be addressed.
From me, you'll find out how it feels to watch the man I like die without need.
A human police persecuted was convinced to get out of Canning River
The Constable of Canning-Wail was able to convince a man to get out of the Canning River and to remain dry.
Perth's inhabitant was going to leave the police, but he couldn't, stuck in a dirty water on a minor guide within a few meters from a police officer trying to "be easy to get him to the shore."
The Canning-Vail police was called on Tuesday on the fact that illegal invasion into a foreign territory in Bakingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to leave them by dropping into Canning.
But he didn't swim far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I'm not going out, come on, grab me," said Sergeant Sergeant Chandel Castledine.
Constable Laclan Perhavec did not want to piss his shape, so he used a safer reception -- "government with a good police."
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," said Sergeant Castledine.
That's what Ben Kazins' football champion remembered.
In 2006, Kazins moved to the cuvet to avoid meeting with a police officer for alcohol checks, and tried to swim Swan.
His efforts have proved to be vain, but the local inhabitants have invented a joke "Ben Kazins".
Peter Moody accuses the stewards of trying to spy and threatens to leave the horse sports.
Peter Moody accused the racing Victoria stewards of trying to introduce a spy into his stable last year and threatened to leave the horse sport immediately.
His aim was the stewards and ethics officers of the Racing Victoria Division, whom he accused of organizing a campaign against him personally, and the withdrawal of Lady Tatai ' s launch because of the violation of the rules of the use of medicinal products on the starting day, on Wednesday, became the last slam.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always made every effort to participate in jumping, and he was in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of the Leaderi's cobalt sample, which he couldn't explain.
He kept his tongue on suspicions of spying for a year and a half and didn't want it to "seem like a green grape".
"I didn't mean to say anything about it, and I've suffered a long time, but sometimes it's so hard that you're not stopping," said Moody.
They know it's been on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep hard.
I want to walk with my head highly raised, and I want my owners to know I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start to think it's not true, I'm gonna have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think what to do with my license.
Previously, Moody sentimentally stated during the racing.com interview that the Ethics Division was trying to spy in his stable.
"Shortly a year ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stuart sat in the room with the man I would call if they were asked, and offered him a job in my cabinet to provide information about what I am doing in the coast," said Moody at Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is true, they should be made statements because the attempt to catch me was unsuccessful.
Robert Rolston, former President of RVL, David Moody, current President of RVL, and Bernard Sondrie, the executive director of RVL, knew it all the time and now.
Shouldn't that make me think the case becomes personal?
Shouldn't RVL get courage and call for the answer for what is happening in this business, other people, other than coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I so bad for this profession?
Maybe there's people who think it's true.
Maybe they should take my license and push me out, and I don't doubt what I'm saying right now can make them think about it.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and that's sad.
I'm really sad about that.
I will put pressure on them and put on them responsibility for making decisions.
I have family support, and I can leave.
The coach's disturbance had only grown during a long investigation of the cobalt case and the Leaderi, and the last withdrawal of the horse from the start made him claim that he could "flip his license on the table".
Moody, most famous by preparing an invincible Champion of Black Caviar, referred to the requirements for the use of medicinal products on the day of competitive competition after the horse's legs were compressed from clay, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a breach of jumping rules.
"I must be fully responsible for this," he said.
One of my mistaken workers compressed her on her foot.
She could have been compressed last night.
She could have got it yesterday, just like it was.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Moody may be discvalified for three months in accordance with the rules on the use of medical medicinal products on the day of competition for the use of a compression, which opens the investigation.
It's anecdote.
People who create these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," said Moody.
The driver who invaded and hid from the scene of the event in Cobram was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a motorcycler in Cobram on the weekend and stood out of the scene of the incident.
The motorcycler was delivered to Royal Melbourne on a helicopter with serious wounds after he was hit by a car on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver left without stopping to help a wounded motorcycler.
On Monday, the 50-year-old Natalia was surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
It is expected to be accused of leaving the scene of an accident, not assisting and in violation of other road rules.
The Motorcycle, a 40-year-old Cobrama, remains in the hospital in stable state.
Coach of Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, parches the accusations of rival forces.
Coach of Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, called the criticism of the ball capture of his team as the " entrusting of the agenda " by two favorites of the NRL championship.
Coach of Sydney Rusters Trent Robinson stated that the judges allowed Storm to fight with his team during the sudden victory of the Storm at the final of Sydney qualification game on Friday night.
The Brisbein Broncos coach, Wayne Bennett, made a clear insight on Storm after his team won the final qualification tournament at Nozern Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called this game "typical" for the League of Regby and said that two of the Queensland team were not "too successful" in the fighting.
Bellamy protected the ball capture by his team and said they were just focused on the "contact" captured by the ball.
Bellami added that he was confident that his team criticized by two leading coaches, as that means that they were concerned by the possible defeat of Storm.
"It continues to swim - I didn't hear Trent Robinson speaking about hard receptions when they won us with account 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can assurance that we haven't changed anything in our systems or protection systems for a year, just in the last six weeks, we have given special attention to the contacts when the ball is captured, and this has become a turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years, and he has clearly trained an excellent team, so he is probably not used to losing, and it has become some shock for him.
It's funny how it always shows at this time of the year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea of "impressive football", reminding his teacher that St. George-Illavarra Dragons won Bennett in 2010, showing " boring" football.
Wayne's talking about an exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night, and to see how impressive their game was," Bellami observed.
I remember, in 2010, St. George was criticised as a boring team, and Wayne said he was not concerned.
But now he has a team that can show what he considers as an impressive football, especially his young semi-protectors with their speed.
It's a football you'd like to play when you have such players.
He made this comment in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style -- not every team has two semi-protectors like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so that they can play so.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because a few of them are concerned about the game with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they reached the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the Storm and Rusters game was a high-quantity of points than the Broncos and Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the account? 16-12?
In our game, he was 20:18, there were two other attempts -- and what, what is this impressive football?
Or do you think it's impressive breaks and failure attempts?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, that means we can meet them there at some point.
The Storm's at the end of this week's weekend, because they won the right to accept Nort Queensland Cowboys, or Kronalla Sharks, on the next Saturday night at the preliminary final at the AAMI Park stadium, tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
Serbs charged with drug storage are bailed at $200,000
A man who was threatened to live in prison for attempting to award 40 kg of cocaine delivered to Queensland was bailed at $200,000.
Marco Maximovic, 29 years old, is one of the five arrested last month after the Federal Police discovered 100 pounds of drugs on the Solay yacht that went from South America through Vanuatu and accommodated in Kumer in August.
During the morning, Maximovic and his associates were seen at the harbor, and later he met with them at Coomera Roadhouse Cafe, where the police found 40 pounds of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Although Maximovic has been threatened for life for attempting to sell drugs, the lawyer Maximovic claims that the last attempt to obtain the whole party is missing and that a man could be in the cafeteria without any intention.
Judge of the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, doubted that Maximovic was worth bailing.
The last one has contact with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his location.
The mothers and father of Maximovic were invited to make a joint guarantee of $200,000 for his release.
"At both testimony, it is evident that the amount of $200,000 bail is too large for them," Judge Flanagan noted.
But not enough as a guarantee that he will not disappear, the judge added.
Maximovic was permitted to be released under jail provided that he would submit both its Australian and Serbian passports would be observed in the police every day and would observe the command hours from 6 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Photos of Kacikaris: "I'm proud of Greece's assembly that has been fighting until the last seconds."
The Chief Coach of Greece, Fotis Kacikaris, gave due to his team after the 1/4 final of Europebasket-2015 with Spain (71:73).
He said that the fate of the game had been resolved by certain mistakes.
It was a big game, quoted by AFP Kacicaris.
We were preparing for a great game for the Spanish.
They tried to work in defense, but defence errors identified the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my boys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Friend: "CSC will be assigned to me by the Kaun's functions."
The CSCA newman Joel Friland said he didn't believe in the curse of the Army.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to break the negative trend and finally win the Euroligy next season.
I've spoken to Coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, by myself, after I joined the team, the R-Sport Freeland quoted.
Yeah, I'm going to need some time to restructure to the central position, but I've played more in NBA.
Now we're going to have to resist a large central rival, but I've done this before, so I think I'm gonna do it now.
The Army won Euroliga last in 2008.
Since then, they've got six times to the Final four, but they couldn't show their best basketball there every time.
There's an opinion that someone's been screwing the team.
That's the game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's complicated. I understand all the disappointment of the club and his cheerleaders.
But we have an excellent team now, and if we're going to show the best we can, we have a good chance to win the Euroligy, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, Moscows have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of CSCA.
With regard to the eye, I'm not a superstitious man or I don't believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you connect these two things, everything is possible.
I don't have any certain rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as far as I can.
Louis Enrique: "For me, the Roma game will be special."
The Coach of Barcelona, Louis Enrique, did not hide that he returned to Rome for the 1st tour of the League Championship League with Roma with special feelings.
According to the teacher, his current and former team's eye fight will be far from his senior.
Recall that Louis Enrique trained wolves in season-2011/12, but he was unable to show himself on the best part of the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome a few years later, with a certain experience, and the UEFA's official website of Louis Enrique's words.
I have very warm memories with Rome.
It'll be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start the League of Champions from victory.
August meeting at Joan Gamper's Cube will not affect the action of the teams in the nearest match.
I'm expecting the Roma game she showed in the A series against Euventus.
It's a strong team that can press and know what to do with the ball.
Vadim Screechenko: "Clasnodar" has various options for attacks."
The executive of the Chief Coach of Ural, Vadim Screechenko, at the front of the 9th tour of the Prime Minister Liga with the Krasnodar, noted the diversity of the attacking team schemes.
The teacher said that "bees" have several arsenal models of attack.
The battle will take place on 21 September and will begin at 16:30 in the Moscow time.
When we play with "Clasnodar", we'll see, "the Ural's official site of the word Screechenko.
We've been ahead for a week.
The team has various options for attacks, performs its attacks in many ways, while we are not slow, so I think it will be a very interesting game.
In front of this game, taking into account that "Crasnodar" is taking the League of Europe against the Dortmund Borussia, we will try to prepare very well to win.
Rocher Canyas: "Astana's house can take the glasses from anyone."
Semi-protected Rocher Canyas after the 1st Team Tournament League of the Benfix League (0:2) expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team in the future.
According to Rubek, in their fields, the residents are capable of taking glasses from any rival.
Despite the difficult match for us, I can say we played well, the UEFA official site of Canyas' words.
Benfika's above class, but in the home game, I think we can count on taking their glasses.
It's real.
But first we have to think about Galatasara, then athletic.
At home games, we can take the glasses from anyone.
Rafael Benites: "All times, Christian Ronald is the best in the world."
Rafael Benites, Chief Coach, expressed the satisfaction of the major victory in the 1st Group Tournament League of Championships (4:0).
The specialist gave commendation to the Forward, Christian Ronald, who became the author of three heads.
The match was difficult because the Shahter can own the ball, the UEFA official site of Benites' words.
The rival has not had a lot of moments, but their contratacts always hide the danger.
I'm not saying "Real" played perfectly, but we had enough naked opportunities.
I'm pleased that we didn't miss the balls and slaughter four.
Christian Ronald confirmed his level.
It's the best player in the world, I'll repeat it every time.
Jordy Alba: "Christian Ronald cannot be compared to Messi."
The Barcelona Protector Jordy Alba believes that no one can compare with his co-club Lionel Messi.
According to the Spanish, Christian Ronald's Forward "Real" can't do that either.
The mess on five heads above the others, quoted by Le Figaro Albu.
Even Christian Ronald.
With Leo on the field, I can't compare him to anyone.
Danielle De Rossi: "Barcelona" has not only unique style but also bright individuals.
Semi-protector of Roma, Danielle De Rossi, prior to the team tournament of the League of Champions with Barcelona, noted the importance of compatibility and insufficiency in the game with such a strong rival.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, the beginning at 21.45 a.m. in Moscow.
Recall, the S.E. will carry out its text transmission.
"Barcelona" is a special rival, a good team with beautiful players, quoted by UEFA De Rossi's official website. -
It's hard to play with blue-granate, because they have not only unique style but also bright individuals.
To leave them, we're going to have to go through the whole game and protect each other.
The Messi is almost always successful when it comes to the circle, so we need to maintain compatibility and organizedness.
The Jews are hoping to go into the SCA starting game with the Slavano.
Golkeeper SCA Ilya Jezov emphasized that he was hoping to join the Army in the next KHL championship match.
The Jehov left on the ice instead of Micco Koskinana on the 23th minute, at the 0:3 account, and reflected all the ditches on his gates, the fourth goal of the SCA missed after he replaced the gateway with the sixth field player.
The next match will take the team off the Slovene.
I hope I go to the next starting game, "the R-Sport" of the words of Ezov.
I'm not an expert on the gateway, I'm the gateway, we don't have the repeat of missed heads, so it's hard to track.
"Dinamo" played well, everybody has bad matches.
The team's still lost.
I'd rather miss more, but the team won.

Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to force pedophiles to send photos.
Pedophile used the 11-year-old girl's phone to seek pictures of violence against children.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone while she was asleep, registered on the Internet service for communications, where she received a number of rude pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the missing phone and found it in the sleeping Hogg's hand.
She checked it and found shocking photos, and immediately drew attention to her mother.
The police arrived and saw five images, followed by exploring computers found at that address, and discovered "suitable" requests in the search system using words to identify the harmful pictures of children.
Hogg then said to the police that he did it because it could "take pedophiles" and then he "pretend to be a policeman to frighten them."
The authorized judicial executor Alyd Robertson informed the Sheriff's court in Dunda: "He said that it was an addiction, he was addicted to frightening people.
He confessed that he made computer requests, but said that it was because he wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare pedophiles.
He was questioned about the conversation with an unknown person who sent pictures to him, and that he asked for more photos.
He said he was doing this to lure them.
He said he had a head problem when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see the images of rape and murders.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the photos on the phone, she called her mother, trembled and cried.
She saw the vulnerable pictures on the phone, and then an eye rate was held with the accused.
The girl was questioned and reported that the accused used the computer and the Playstation to talk to girls who looked a lot younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road to Dunda, recognized himself guilty of the accusations of the manufacture of malicious pictures of children on 14 June last year, violated the conditions of bail on 25 January this year and not appeared to be courted on 24 March.
Gregor Sim, attorney of the defendant, asked not to introduce Hog into the list of persons committed with sexual offences, as it could prove that there was no “significant sexual element” in this crime.
Sheriff Alister Carmichael delayed his sentence until October, until he received requests from social services.
Hogg was bailed in this case, but he was detained before the hearing was started on other cases.
It was made in a list of persons who committed sexual crimes before the date of sentence.
President Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe reads the wrong speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the senior government leader of Africa, had fallen from the stairs leading from the floor earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of the falling scene was currently spread by social networks.
The opening of Parliament was also undermined by the statements of parliamentary opponents that they had received anonymous threats to prevent them from whistling Mugaba during treatment.
For a month ago, the president was acquainted during his address to the nation in Parliament; that was the speech Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Member of Parliament from the Movement for Democratic Changes, Innosent Goneze stated that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning to not interrupt the speech of Mugabe.
"The message came from a number that was not displayed, but called Death," he informed journalists at the end of the speech of Mugabe.
It warned the noted members of the Parliament that immunity was ended in the parliamentary building and as soon as they exited, parliamentary integrity did not work.
The Member of Parliament stated that the Party headed by Morgan Zwangirai was " disturbed" by its policies.
Hewlett-Packard reduces to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard suggests to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs under its restructuring and reducing services costs.
This same year Hewlett-Packard will be divided into two companies registered in the company market, separateing computers and printers from the faster development sectors of equipment and service operations.
As a result of the estimated reduction of jobs, approximately $2.7 billion, starting from the fourth quarter, said Hewlett-Packard.
" Such restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, Chairman and Director-General Hewlett Packard, who will head the organization after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more focused than Hewlett-Packard currently, and the business portfolio will be wider and deeper to help the company move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual amount of more than $50 billion and " will be focused on providing previously unreachable integrated technological solutions" to companies, is reported in the statement of the company.
This is how the company educated in the 1930s of the Stanford University, Bill Hughlett and Dave Pacard for electrical equipment, and their garage in Palo Alto called "the place of birth of the Cremney Valley".
Hewlett Packard is in a massive reorganization process to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This step of HP, the second in the world of the manufacturer of personal computers and one of the largest U.S. Technical Company, is the latest event in this sector based on confidence that the occupational companies work better.
Captain Arsenala, Michel Arteta, says his co-clubs should support the traumatic Jack Wilshire before the game with Dynamo Zagreb.
In his conversation with Wilshire Wanger also emphasized that only September, and that if the reconstruction of Wilshire would go according to the plan, nothing would stop him from coming back to Christmas.
With the most favourable development of the events, Wilshire will definitely miss at least four next games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European championship remains questioned next summer.
The most of all in this recent problem is that Wilshire was surely finished the previous season with the only ice trauma and was going to return to the common aggressive game style during pre-session preparations.
Hungarian: "This injury does not threaten his career."
It's just not the end of the bone.
It's nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
This has nothing to do with nipples or injuries that he's had before.
This may be medically related, but, as Hungarian also allowed, there is a risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also a disadvantaged trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire had 23 different traumas that occurred in six years of his debut.
Furthermore, he played only 65 of 157 Arsenal games in the League for the last five seasons.
If you look at the Arsenal schedule wider, you can notice that in six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007-08, the Arsenal was one of the two Premier League clubs, which accounted for the most missing days.
Hungarian recognises the probability of a corrupt circle, but Arsenal believes that the improvement of trauma statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you return after the injury, you have been vulnerable for a while, you need to re-establish forces and gain competitive advantages," said Wanger.
Jack's young enough and he'll do it.
I hope he'll be physically recovered, and I'm sure that his career will be the one he deserves.
The Arsenal starts a campaign in the League of Champions on Wednesday with Dynamo-Zagreb and will continue on Saturday with Chelsea and next Wednesday with Totenham Hotspore, and Wanger intends to make a rotation of the composition.
Hector Belierin and Aaron Ramsey did not arrive in Croatia, so they will probably play Matheus Debushi and Artea.
Hungarian may also be composed of Qiran Gibbs and Olivia Gera instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
"I am trying to maintain balance and give a little rest to the players who need it," said Wanger.
Although the Arsenal is an unconditional favorite in group F, the Maximir stadium in Zagreb is the number of the most distressed in Europe.
"Dinamo" has not lost any of the 41 matches since they were able to spend the last season as "Invincible".
On Tuesday night, the stadium was affected by the earthquake by the scale of 3.2 points.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Hungary is convinced that the Arsenal had learned a lesson from the last season when the team was defeated by the League of Champions of Monaco, and remains with a weak hope to bring the club to the final of the Championships.
"It's an incredible drive," said Wanger.
Arsenal has never done that before.
We were very close to the target in 2006, but, on the other hand, I am a realist with the internship.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons of male friendship
The absence of such stories is in the eye, especially if the need for men to be honest is desperate, now more than ever, when the level of suicide among young men is at the maximum of 15 years.
In 2013, this was the only greatest cause of men's death between 20 and 45 years of age in the United Kingdom, and the men were three times more likely than women.
In an attempt to address the issue of "Compania against Unfortunate Life", it announced that the Year of Men was the Year of Mans in order to challenge a culture that prevents men from calling for assistance when they need it.
Friendship is in the centre of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 universities with depression symptoms revealed that if a patient has enough friends in normal moods, the chances for treatment are doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends reduces the chance of mental disorders.
But, of course, for friendship to work, it needs to be.
In the age when communications are managed by social networks, when the style prefers content, the response rate is often more valuable than the content contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, loving joy and successful, even if loneliness is real.
Such surface success depends on what psychologists call external values -- money, image, social status, entirely by internal values, our internal desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a stronger impact on our mental health.
And, like a billionaire recently noticed, a video gamemaker, you can't buy any more happiness for money.
The dignity of Friends is that they draw attention to it.
Each of the characters was determined not by their work, but rather by the personality that was in association with friends.
The Humor of Joey and Chandler's constant hugs, the football moments on the comfortable chairs, the sighs of Ross on Rachel -- all comes from the understanding that men can feel that, even if they are often abstaining from a full study of their feelings.
As Samarity officer said to me: "... my role in listening to people who feel depressed and self-suicidal moods stresses how even the smallest communities of friends can benefit."
Often, those men who approach us are not able to talk to friends.
The old lesson "live with this" is strong, as well as the feeling that an honest discussion of problems can be accepted as weakness."
Friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I'm trying to propose more working mechanisms to overcome.
It emphasized the unremarkable moments of male friendship.
With regard to my task, the status of a foreign speaker on the phone helps people when they are desperate, but long-term support comes from the neighbouring circle of family and friends.
So if you visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where the decorations have been fully restored for the celebration, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk.
Or even better, if you see a lonely man in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You can't guess what friendship can benefit.
The series Friends show at Comedy Central from the beginning and to the end, all 236 series, by tag #FriendsFest
Dee Maria's on the goal, helping the PSJ to smash "Malmo"
Angel di Maria, as well as the Bless of Matthew and Edinson Cavani, celebrates the balls at the Malmo gate.
Angel di Maria, debuting at the Championship League, put a naked goal down by allowing the PSJ to go through Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the response to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their case when Pare St. German started his game in the League of Champions with a very comfortable victory 2:0 against Malmo on the Park de Prens stadium on Tuesday.
Dee Maria smashed the ball less than four minutes after his first game in the League of Championships as a PSJ player, to set direction to the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their advantages when Cavani had slaughtered the goal for the 61st minute.
In addition to the Real Madrid and the Shahter Domain in Group A, the Pairs had to start a good start in the game against Sweden's champions because they were targeted not to play off, but to continue a series of successful games in the last three seasons where they reached the fourth-finals.
They earned the glasses, however, was not the best solution by Lauran Blan to consider Golden Ibrahimovic useless in the attack and later to replace him with a field in a game against the team from his hometown and the club in which he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win home or visit the Championship League, so that we get a victory with account 2:0, delivering problems to the rivals and playing great protection is a good start, even if there are other moments that we need to finish during the season," said Blan.
That's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did it, although I wish we didn't hit one or two balls more.
Ibrahimovic returned after the injury in one of the composite of the Paris team, which brought her a none at account 2:2 at the Bordo game on the weekends, but departed D. Maria for the fourth minute.
The Argentinian attacker was noted as a player capable of bringing the PPP to a new level in Europe after he was ransomed from the Manchester UNITED last month, and he proved why when he fled from Marco Verratti behind the protection of Malmeo, he had successfully completed the attack by sending the ball past Johann Villand to the distance of the gate.
However, if someone was expecting a light and great victory from the PPP then, they had to be disappointed.
"Malmeo", who won Seltik in playoff to reach this stage, having a major opponent in the field of nine world players at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two resistant semi-protectors in the middle of the field.
But except for Nicolas Djurjich's hit, where the ball flew past Kevin Trapp's gate on the 34th minute, they attacked a little bit.
However, PSG has sometimes led himself to unrecoverable transmissions and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who was not able to implement at least five attempts in the first half, and then failed to process the Cavani ball immediately after the game was resumed.
Nevertheless, he showed himself much more skillful in the exact passages, and it was a passage from Ibrahimovic, which, De Mary, had sent a ball with a twist, which passed through the viland steng on 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally stabbed after the clock mark, thanks to Cawani, and the Uruguayan stuck his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimovic fixed the ball sent to the center of the field from the left flang Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmo had about returning to the game, and only Wiland's ball capture from a close distance did not allow David Louis to increase the final account before the substitute of Essequel Lavessi was counted on the goal at the end of the match.
Age Haraide coach later admitted that PSG was a class above his team, and Norwegian said, "Our last game in the League of Champions took place last December."
Since then, we played only in the Swedish League, and that's not the level.
Insufficient qualifications.
Praise "Money"!
It was a wonderful match with them.

The second forum of Russia and Belarus regions will be held in Sochi.
The second forum of Russia and Belarus regions will be held on 17-18 September in Sochi, which will take part in the Tumen delegation, headed by the Governor.
The forthcoming event in Sochi and the interim outcomes of cooperation are described by the honorable General Consulate of the Republic of Belarus in Tumena, Vladimir Schugla, a member of the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovic, what challenges has the socio forum?
The scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Federal State.
It is based on the fruitful cooperation of the regions - important relations between the two States.
It is planned that the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and President of the Republic of Belarus, Alexander Lukašenko, will participate in the plenary meeting.
In the framework of plenary and section meetings, the experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policies, the rule of law and programmes of the Federal State will be addressed.
The forum will be held by the Governor of the Tumen area.
I think that this shows the successful, sustainable interregional cooperation of the region and Belarus.
Forum will also be attended by representatives of Professional Ministries and agencies, Russian and Belarus Entrepreneurs.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tumen region, will work.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.
I will add that the first such meeting was held in Minsk in June last year.
More than 200 delegates, including 19 regions of Russia, participated in his work.
At the same time, a very important collaboration treaty between the Tumenian and the Minsk Areas was signed.
The significance of our work is also the fact that the meeting of a permanent seminar at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union and Belarus was held in Tumena.
Furthermore, the APC delegation of the Tumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to explore the experience of the work of Belarus in the preparation of agriculture training, the identification of additional points of accession and the organization of new investment projects in the agro-industrial complex.
You have recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What subjects were discussed?
During the meeting with the Governor of the Tumen region, Vladimir Jakushew talked about the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus under contemporary difficult conditions.
The issue of agricultural supplies and the use of financial mechanisms of Belarus is to reduce the cost of vehicles for the final consumer.
Problems were discussed in the work of the Belshina Tumen trade house and the prevention of losses.
Questions are important, as investment projects should work clearly and bring profits to the region.
There were further supplies from OAO " MAZ", the development of the OAO OAO " MAZ", which was established in Tumena on the OAO "TPATP".
The discussion also addressed the travel of the work delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus until the end of the year.
Another theme of the conversation was the conclusion of the harmonization and signing of the Agreement on Trade and Economic, Scientific and Cultural Cooperation of the Tumen area and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamic of relationships promises to come to a new level.
These issues were also related to the area centre.
During the meeting with the head of the city of Tumeni, Alexander Moor, we talked about the update of the Tumen bus park.
About 100 buses are already breathing on the laden, so a new part of the vehicles from Belarus are required to work on gas, environmentally clean fuel.
Another aspect: The Tumen elevator is cooperating with one of the leading elevator producers of OAO " Mohilevliftmash " , receiving completion.
In my view, this activity could be more active, taking into account new elevator programmes in the area centre.
I would add that the expansive competence of the consul was a meeting with Governor of the Kurgan region, Alexe Kokorin, which discussed the increase of the goods and delivery of contemporary Belarusian techniques in Zauralia.
At the end of September, a meeting with the Omi Governor was scheduled.
The enlarged Consul district includes five PF subjects, but the Tumen can be referred to as a headquarters of the district.
The region is a polygon for many prospective projects, including the work of the honored genconsul.
Such meetings are generally important and good by allowing many problems to be addressed directly and quickly by taking them off and developing mutual collaboration.
In the present circumstances, it is essential not to ruin the task by continuing to work for the prospect.
Matt Damon against emphasizing the ethnic diversity of people engaged in movie production
Matt Damon argued with an African producer, Effy Brown, claiming that the ethnic composition should not be taken into account.
During the Sunday show of Project Greenlight at the HBO channel, the famous acter crossed Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative views to the main black heroin in the project scenario.
"Multificent is when you make a casting for the movie, not for the show," insisted Damon.
The screwed Brown, without faith in her ears, screamed off "Wow, wow, wow, all the time the actor from Marsian was giving comments in the direct air.
To discuss the finalists of the show with Damon and Brown, accompanied by colleagues producers Ben Afflek and the Farelli brothers.
"I wish that participants -- no matter who would be the director -- were wondering what tracts of the Harmony image they were going to hold," Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute beating a white suitcase.
The producer of the Dear White People was speaking to make the film directors Leo Angelos and Christen Brankacho; Damon was sharply opposed, saying that "in the end we can get the wrong thing we want."
After this discussion was shown on the TV, social networks exploded by unappropriate comments on Damon.
The user of Twitter Mr Pooni angeredly said about the video: "The explanation of the meaning of the diversity of Matt Damon to the only black man in the White room that hurts so much."
Tweet collected more than 5,000 retwits and 4,000 "links".
Damon's statements appear just when the literary racial topic in the media was the most acute issue of the public discussion.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot by a police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement came to popularity throughout the country, calling on legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the colorful population.
In February, the singer of Prince mentioned this movement during the presentation of the nomination of the Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
"Alboms still matter," he said.
As books and lifes of black people, the albums are still important.
Recently, Black Lives Matter leaders issued an official statement in response to the question of Fox News Elizabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group would be considered as a group of haters.
"The Black Live Matter Network is a group of love," said the leaders of the movement.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of performers of show business, producers and media Magnates invited to visit the Pope of Rome to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unknown whether the actress accepted the invitation and whether he met with the Pope.
American Ninja Warrior rewards the first champion
The Professional Scale and the Assistant of Officer Isaac Caldero became the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior show on Monday night, which took home a prize of $1 million.
In this sports show, the season season seven, no participants had yet been able to pass all stages of the road with obstacles.
In the final season, two participants, Caldiero and Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included a 75-foot rope elevation in 30 seconds.
Britten performed his mission first and took place at the time given, as the first athlete in the history of America Ninja Warrior, the past fatigue phase 4, but Caldiero managed the challenge for three seconds faster, which made him a winner.
After the victory of the incredible work, Caldiero, who was in shock of winning a million dollars, gave an interview with E!News.
"To think of this incredibly, I have never earned or lived more than 10,000 dollars a year," Isaac commented to journalists E! such a serious jump of my income.
And suddenly... I never even imagined how this is happening... the future is unknown.
Manufacturer Kent Wid met with the Hollywood Reporter journalists to discuss the final and why Britten, who first passed the route, would not receive any money prize.
According to the rules, the money is obtained by the fastest participant.
"If more than one finalized player, the prize receives the fastest one of them," Wid said.
Although the money is a wonderful reward and changes life, it still gets great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels insulted about this.
He's happy with what he did.
He received tons of remarkable replies from fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "If I was meant to lose someone, I'm glad Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same if we had changed our roles.
The American Ninja Warrior show will be returned with the eighth season that will be taken in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tygers are quietly circulated by Minnesota Twins.
MINEAPOLIS - The second half of the season was not particularly fun for Detroit Tygers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, Tygers, is now taking the last place in the Central Division of the American League.
Pretending only to be a disturbance, the Tygers wins on Tuesday at Minnesota Twins with 5-4 at Targetfield.
Twins missed the chance of reducing half-game departure from Houston Astros and taking the second place in the playoff at the number of scores after the winners.
For the detroits, even for one night, it was the return of the word to the letter F, which slipped out most of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they get," said Brad Osmus manager.
Pitcher Tygers, Alfredo Simon, contributed to the attacks, resulting in which Detroit had three points in the first two innings, then added one in sixth and one in ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a beaker in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third quality start in nine exits.
"I just want to finish a year with good indicators," said Simon.
Pitchers can't quit each game, and that's why I want to go deeper into the game.
The designated Tigers, Victor Martinez, was able to reverse three hits, and had two wounds -- the first RBI from mid-August.
It was the first day with three hits since four hits in the game against Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
"He worked well with a bit," said Osmus.
He showed himself well in (better quality), better in the work of the bit and maintained this quality for the game.
After three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, Twins got their best chance to go back to the game.
The central host Byron Baxton opened the inning on the left line of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks took the first base, and the second Baysman Brian Dozier got a strike-out on Simon before his seat was taken by the left Blaine Hardy.
Hardy crossed Moire, the only player on the road, before the new designated miguel Sano, who had exploded a double "singl" on the left of the right hand of Drew Verhagen.
With a couple of wounds not in the car and comparing wounds on the second base of Verhagen, the third baseman, Trevor Pluff, was able to bring to the Dable Play.
It was the 27th time for the leading League player in this season when Pluff blew the ball on the dable play.
After Detroit added the insurance wound in the first half of the ninth inning, Moir earned RBI "dable" into the space between the outsiders against the Tigers closing beet, Bruce Rondon, and account was 5-4.
However, the right hand player hit Sano after three strikes and got his fifth seive.
Detroit used the advantage of the temporaryly untrained Phil Hughes at the beginning of the game.
The Tygers earned three wounds in the first two innings against the earned beaker, which was on the list of traumatized before the game, lacking more than a month in connection with the flashing of the belt.
"Surely not the start I'd like," said Hughes, "but as the game's development, I started to feel more comfortable and so I could make a few pretty good throws in the third inning."

Its participants are obliged to monitor and remove incorrect comments to migrants and refugees.
According to Haiko Maas, the authors of the non-tolerant posts are expected to receive notifications on the basis of the reason for the removal of their records.
Enhanced the operational blocking of the illegal content should also be accompanied by organizations whose experts are collecting complaints from users of the social network of insulting posts.
The Facebook Guide is intended to provide the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements to migrants and refugees, the leadership of the social network and the Ministry of Justice of Germany was adopted after the German Facebook segment rapidly increased xenophobic moods.
One of the most obvious reasons for them has become an unprecedented migration crisis that has covered the countries of the European Union for a while ago.
So, in Germany, all refugees are now filled with.

Professionals believe that in such “angles” visitors of the cemetery will be able to rest, stay alone and restore psychological forces.
Relaxation zones will be built in the Domodedow, Botovski and Scherbin cemetery, and then in other areas of the capital.
According to GBU chapter “Ritual”, when the need to expand the cemetery, the builders will try to maintain the existing forest mass as possible.
Green plants will serve a living fence that will divide the rest zones and squares that are placed directly under the cemetery for burying.
The experts of GBU " Ritual " also stated their intention to make a proposal for refusal from buried fences.
The new cemetery can really become barrier.
Furthermore, the GBU " Ritual " said that it would be ready to set up electronic terminals with which the visitors of the cemetery would be able to know GPS coordinates and numbers of funeral signs.
In June this year, the GBU " Ritual " also proposed to adjust the cost of burying services depending on the time of the year.
So, diging the graves in summer time will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, a winter week when the land is freezing.
Notice that, in the last year, all types of ritual services traveled at a average of 10 per cent.

News of the Economics † Nobel laureat: globalization
The printing of Globalization Process had to contribute to the reduction of inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation seems different, the difference in the income of the population in developing economies, on the contrary, is increasing.
Eric Maskin.
In order to correct this, the level of education of low-qualified workers should be improved, according to the Chief Scientific Officer of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Election of Decisions of the NIU WHO, the Nobel Prize Laureate on the Economy 2007, Eric Maskin.
In the last twenty years, the world has survived the unexpected growth of global markets.
Trade borders between countries were increasingly open.
Globalization parties predicted great benefits for developing economies.
"And these projections have come true in many ways," emphasizes Maskin.
For example, China and India have had a serious increase in GDP per person.
But it's not all so good.
Globalization was expected to reduce the departure between " poor" and "poor" in poor countries, which was shown in a large inequality of income and, more specifically, labour payments.
In fact, however, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article "Why the global markets did not reduce the inequality in developing economies," published in the World Bank Economic Review, translated and quoted by NIE.
In conjunction with the economist, Michael Kremer Maskin, professor of the Harvard University, developed an alternative theory, showing why the income differences in poor countries as globalization grows, reminds NIE WHO.
There are specific processes in the new global market.
In order to show them, Maskin has allocated four qualifications of Professionals - A and B for rich countries, C and D for the poor.
After globalization, Professional D from poor countries lacks skills to cooperate with Professional A and B from rich countries.
And if the employees of level C from the poor countries have increased salary by collaboration with the wealthy B staff, the D growth workers do not feel or their salary falls.
The outcome effect is that internationalization of production will contribute to increasing labour gap between two categories of professionals in poor countries and to increase inequality accordingly.
Cremer and E. Maskinami offered a remarkably beautiful model, alternative Ricardian theory of comparable advantages.
It explains why globalization has led to inequality in income,” said Fuad Alescerov, a regular professor who led the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision Selection, head of the NIU Mathematics Department.
And as any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to an explosion of empirical work in this area.
The solution to the problem, according to Eric Maskin, is to improve the level of education of low-qualified workers.
However, the workers themselves, according to the scientist, have no funds for this, but companies are uncomfortable to pay their training.
In such a situation, Governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds can play a significant role, Maskin believes.
The scientist notes that the elaborated theory did not in any event call on the process of globalization that brought and produced its fruits in the form of GDP growth of countries.

There was a business game at the airport in Domodedova.
The capital experiences a new form of training.
Four hundred students tried themselves as airport staff.
For this, three aviation models were mounted in Domodedes.
Young people were not only investigating and registering passengers, but also serving aircraft.
All of this was in a business game, but it was not a complicated part of the reality.
The late flights, immediately two passengers with breaks on board, lost the trail somewhere on the road to the plane.
For the present airport, hell.
For the one founded in the Domodedova hangar, the standard set of tasks to be decided by the new girls.
One hangar placed three large airports from different countries of the world immediately.
Today, there are four hundred students from capital colleges and knots.
It's an unprecedented chance to know everything about the internal world of aircraft.
The registration of passengers, the service of aircraft, the turnover of the luggage were entrusted with buses in the summer field, meals and surveillance of passengers.
And the passengers are very troubled.
One mess with the documents, another late for the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious objects.
And we need to deal with this, as in life, at a minimum time.
For each of these tasks, they are calculated by a certain amount, virtual money, as if airlines paid them the corresponding amount for flight service.
"There is a fine for the failure to perform the tasks," explains the News-Moscow financial analyst of the game, Dmitri Hilko, interviewed.

The United States Embassy regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The US Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the foreign literature of the American Centre in the Library.
The Centre has worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The United States Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian Government to close the United States Embassy Centre to the Universal State Library of the United States in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps taken by the RF have recently understood the commitment of the Government of Russia to the links between the Russian and American peoples, which were not interrupted even during the cold war and at other difficult times of the long history of our countries," stated Ambassador John Tefft in the United States in Interfax.
The American Centre has created deep and strong links between people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the centre of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, as well as the place of meeting with many American visible actors, including astronauts, artists, sportsmen, scientists, politics and writers.
"Only last year, the American Centre held over 400 cultural and educational activities and took over 50,000 Russian visitors," the diplomat stressed.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago a decision was made to close another joint Russian-American project, a programme of educational exchanges of FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Programme).
The Green Tribunal was quick to debate.
Typical situation: Four officials are standing in front of the table of Judge Swatanter Kumar, hearing his claims to work.
The court is not fully satisfied with the quality of your work.
We have not given you a 110-sided order to cheer on him, says Kumar.
If there's any other ciggle, we'll order to take down all the buildings we have.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judicial authority established in 2010 to stop the rapid environmental pollution, accompanied by the rapid economic growth of the past decades.
During that time, the Tribunal was able to consider more than 10,000 lawsuits related to air pollution, gathering garbage, geological developments, toxic wastes and building dambs.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to stop the construction leading to pollution.
Incredibly high: in the short of 60 years since the independence of industrial development, India has become a virgin jungle from one of the most inhabited and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in major megapolises where infrastructure development is not aimed at rapid urbanization: cities covered with dense capacities, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste of enterprises and households, and few remaining housing massives are excluded from new housing blocks.
Despite the formal support of the green movement by the State, the NZT has been regularly criticized by the Government of Narendra Modi, as it often becomes the main cause of revocation of largest investment projects.
In May this year, the Minister of Environment called the Court ' s decisions " extremal " and " incomplete " .
Sometimes the court's decision is in fact impossible to meet at the time given by the court, confirmed by the ecological attorney Raj Pandžwani.
However, the incomplete dedlines also have a positive side: at least they make responsible people move.
"His main objective is to shake the system," adds the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly revoked large buildings: the cease-building of airports, electrical stations and hundreds of smaller buildings.
In addition, people are also endeavoured to remember: for example, during the discussion of the fate of the pharmaceutical company in Telagnan, which contaminated the local river with flood.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
" People will lose their job," commented Kumar's decision.
Such explanations, however, do not always find understanding in simple people whose life can change through a single pair of judges.
Thus, in April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles over 10 years of age of entry into the capital than the international disrespect.
Despite rapidly falling popularity and criticism, Swatter Kumar refused to cancel that decision.
Instead, he ordered the Government of Delhi statistics on the driving and departure of the car and offered to buy 10,000 additional buses, prior to finding out in factories whether they were able to perform such orders.
As the court’s attention began to fall into the scope of pollution such as waste, fuel quality, and even road accidents, the anger of the people began to be slightly silent.
But the most painful theme of the Principal Judge was the Gang River Cleaning Programme, with announced Prime Minister Narendro Maudi last year.
When it comes to Ganga, a holy river for the Indians, the judge often stops obstacling his emotions and turns to scream.
You know what the word "holy" means?
Someone has poured water from Gang on the statue of God, and there are fecalies in it, and the judge is warm.
You continue to pollute the river because you think Gang is Gang, he will take away all our sins.
This is the river we worship, and see what you do to it every day.
The cleaning of Gang is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new Government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds more than 120 times.
From 1.5 to 3 of 700 million Hindus bathing every year die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even sacrificed the Gang Rescue Fund for the sale of his suit, in which he met with Barack Obama and 455 other items from his personal collection.
The ecologists immediately accused the Prime Minister of Populism that the costume was purchased for $700, while the cleaning of the river required at least eight billion.
Participants of the Green Tribunal agree that India has to take a long way before it can call itself a developed country, but they do not believe that the price of progress should be environmental.
"In the developing country, talks on the environment are often seen as disadvantaged luxury," said the activist of the "Ganga Zov" Malik Bhanott.
And the court is trying to find a gold midst between environmental and development."

Si Zingpin encourages the economy to be more open to the world
The economy should be more open to the world in order to raise its growth, as President Si Zingpin said on Tuesday in addressing the group with the reform leadership task.
" China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing openness policy," he said, addressing the Committee ' s 16th meeting of the central leading group on the full-invasion of reforms.
He said that the promotion of openness and deepening of reform would give the economy a new impulse and vital force and provide a new space for economic development.
The Chief Group adopted a number of directives, including the regulation of market access of investors, the amendment of border control rules, the promotion of public enterprises (SOE) attracting private capital and the revision of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of economic and production sectors that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually reconciled through test programmes.
This is an important step, as it will give a more important role to the market in the distribution of resources, the legitimacy of business and openness, as stated in the statement.
The Government will also weaken control of the powers given to companies, guaranteeing that companies will manage their own business.
The statement also states that China will allow border regions to conquer new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to strengthen local growth.
More areas will be available to private investors to enhance the openness of the under-controlled economic sectors.
"The Government will not change its policy against foreign investors and protect the legitimate interests of foreign funding companies and provide them with better conditions," the statement said.
Furthermore, the procedure for applications to be lodged for permanent residence for aliens, or " Greencard", will be facilitated by optimising the requirements and simplifying the delivery process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, it was also attended by Prime Minister Lee Ketzan and Minister Leo Yunshan and Jang Gaoli.
