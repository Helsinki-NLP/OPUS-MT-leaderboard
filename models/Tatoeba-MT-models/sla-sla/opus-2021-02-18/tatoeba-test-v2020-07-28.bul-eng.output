Speaking French is a big party.
Did you actually try?
Hey.
These are Tom's dogs.
I'll give it to you for free.
You better not go.
This summer's late.
If you don't speak English, the probability of taking a good position is much less.
You didn't give me the rest you had to.

I think this should be expected.
This book is in easy French.
I have to go now.

Why should we help you?
I don't want to go out tonight.
They serve a great food here.
Tom, where are you?

Stand up, please.
Who told you my name was Tom?
That's Tom's.

Did Tom say nothing about this?
The French isn't that hard to learn at all.
I think you've done enough.
When did you start studying French?
I'll come to you.
No one else suggested help.
Take your coat.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I'll make you happy.
Let's play something.
What are you going to do?
If we just stop trying to be happy, we'd have a pretty good time.
I forgot his name.
We're not rushing.
She's rather shy than associal.
I got to the station after the train left.

I can't afford to buy it.
Where are we going?
I think we should find out where Tom is.
I'd like to thank my parents, Tom and Mary.

There's no time.
You love the kids, don't you?

Unbelievable!
That's all you can do.
It's time to get a goodbye.

What else is in your pocket?
There was no other place to go.
The man pushed her off.
A hug of you will make me happy.
I can't believe you still trust Tom.
Please forgive me.
We've been waiting with a weak expectation.
I hear Boston was pleasant at this time of the year.
What's your nickname?

I want everlasting life.
Are you sure you want to hear it?
I think you'll be happy.

This dress is worth the money.
Tom got his shirt locked up.
I don't remember sending the letter.
Why does he look mad?

I don't think you really want to do that.
Looks like you've achieved significant success since the last time I saw you.
The station is in the center of the city.
Don't even make it hard to come.
Both are unpredictable and impatient.
So do I.
I don't like how you're acting.
What are we doing here?
The object is out of the direction of this investigation.
You sat on my seat.
You're absolutely right.
You're impossible.
Tom said you'd come.
You have to be careful.
I think we'll need Tom's help.
What did you like?
Everything's gonna be okay.

How are you today?
I'm really interested.

That's not Tom's problem.
Keep the missile tight.
Going home, I saw it again.
Her hair's long.
I put it in your room.
I thought you were serious with Tom.
They won't bother you anymore.

I don't give lessons.
It's your turn now.
Do you love your mother?
I think you need a break.

I think what Tom did was very stupid.
I wish I could speak French as a bearer of the language.
I'd like to find my account.
I heard you talk.
We became friends right away.

Leave it to me.
They lied to you.
I have to go and ask Tom.

Her sweater is purple.
Now, after I registered, what am I supposed to do?
It's clear that the Americans can't even solve their own problems, so how do they even imagine that they are able to deal with the problems of the rest of the world?
Speak clearly so that everyone can hear you.
I've got a bowl.
From now on, I'm going to learn French more seriously.
Do you have any other questions?
It was awfully cold yesterday.
I forgot to give him the message.
I finished American literature at college.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
We were insane of anxiety.
I think you'll be happy.
Teenagers left.
I wish I was rich.
I barely started.
If you need anything, just call.
Remember, it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.

She bought a toy for the kid.
I didn't get the answer from you, I was wondering if my e-mail even got to you.

Excuse me, how many are these?
Please repeat it again.
I think so.
Many museums don't work Monday.
They got Tom to the hospital to wash his stomach because he's eating something poisonous.
Don't make me do that.
You sat in my seat.
Let him not give him God!
Your green's good.
I bet you know French.
To dinner, Tom took Mary to a restaurant on the coast of the sea.
You don't have to pay for the apartment in advance.
Let's play tennis this afternoon.
Whatever you get older, you can always learn.
Do you live in Sasayama?
I wish everything Tom said was a lie.
What's the weather tomorrow?
Is there kids?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy listening to you singing.
Can you come tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
We can't hide that fact from her.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
Some say the French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I like to make pictures.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you like French wine?
You have to follow your promises.
Tom's sitting on a diner.
The girls were dancing in the room.
She is convinced that her son is still alive.
Do you have any French books?
Finally, I stopped in front of the old house and looked at the city again.
You won't see anything without a lamp.
My father's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer's right.
She wrote a letter.
There's a lot of ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit I'm crying.
We've been using this insecticide for two years.
Come help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, that's bad!
The bus arrived empty.
We need to keep helping Tom.
My mother has a nice handwriting.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to postpone the meeting.
Tom tied up his shirt and then put his tie on.
It's very cold today, isn't it?
You won't be able to help us.
She's popular, but not because she's beautiful, but because she's treating everyone well.
Ken plays football every day.
You're welcome again at any time.
I don't want tea, I want coffee.
Attorneys and car mechanics are the people I trust at least.
Would you wait outside?
Can you eat cruel oysters?
What prevented you from working?
Who's the manager?
What are you asking?
I was convicted.
The train was 500 miles an hour.
She gave me this CD.
The director thought about the possibility of fireing Tom, but he decided not to.
I have to take it off.
Tom sat by the window.
I don't think you really want to do that.
Most of them were students from the West Coast.
Is this possible for love?
I'll eat it here.
Tom has two children.
The police shouldn't take bribes.
I was in the mountain.
That's what I said.
You're lying, aren't you?
Travelers across South Germany will see farms with solar panels anywhere to turn their eyes.
Don't look at the box.
You're running.
I heard the phone ringing.
That's why I can't believe it.
He was angry that no one said anything.
Tom is the only student in our class who can speak French.
I'm sorry I confused your plans.
I'll ask you to translate this report to French.
No one's confused.
Everybody jumped up.
Many traders were robbed during disagreements.
Why do I have to learn French?
She's not tall.
It's true!
We're grateful for your help.
Since we're wearing clothes, we don't know each other.
Let's start.
He visited his uncle yesterday.
Tom's lower than the average growth.
I found the key.
I know that's important.
My aunt, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful blouse.
It's delicious.
You have a lot of friends who worry about you.
I don't have any pencils.
I don't know Tom so well.
Now I'll tell you the truth.
You're drunk.
That's partly true.
He lives here for the last ten years.
I have socks, but I don't have shoes.
Shit.
She calls me Kenji.
I have the information you asked for.
In a mysterious way, the sense of humor is related to national characteristics.
Swimming is one of the things Tom likes to do.
He'll be back tomorrow.
Forget about feeding the dog.
I need to look into things.
I'll watch you.
I used to want to be astrophysics.
Tom's bleeding.
This camera is Tom's.
I'm sick.
I really appreciate your help.
I bought a red tie.
Do you want me to cut it down a little bit?
It's a book.
I have to do everything Tom tells me.
You can do it, come on, I'm with you.
Did Mike stop drinking?
Aren't you glad to see me?
I really wouldn't make it without you.
I'm not mad at you, I'm just very disappointed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
Did you and my little sister leave at the same time?
The sword was delayed for an unknown time.
His brother teaches a lot.
Ken arrived in Kyoto.
Have you seen Tom?
I wish I was higher.
Is there a lot of people visiting the museum?
The thieves robbed the museum.
He's crazy about you.
He's coming inside to speak French.
Tom helped Mary dress her coat.
That cabuki book could be expensive.
I'm sorry.
Is this your book?
I always wanted to learn French.
Will you call Tom, or do you want me to do it?
Don't be afraid of Tom.
He's on his elbows.
What's the minimum salary in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom he's disgusting.
What's the minimum salary in New Zealand?
I'm shopping with him for the price.
You can speak French, can't you?
My dad smokes rarely.
His inadequate attempts to taste her, showed him that he had wrong address; she was the mother of two children.
I lost him.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything you just said.
We're related souls.
The boss is very upset.
That doesn't change anything.
I have a meeting with him at lunch.
The invitation said there would be popcorn and no alcoholic drinks.
Tom looks fade.
I hope that helps.
What have you found?
I think we should get out of here.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
He's much older than Ken.
Where are the showers?
Mike runs very fast yesterday.
Do you have a European health insurance card?
None of the balls is yellow.
I know a guy you need to meet.
I was rude.
Kuala Lumpur is worth a visit.
I couldn't make them understand me.
Do you speak French too?
I recently started learning French, so I'm not very good.
These gloves belong to Tom.
Where's the entrance?
Tom's trying to get Mary's answer.
A boy, not more than five years old, asked Tom how to get to the mail.
Tom still lives with his parents.
Sometimes we meet them.
I think Tom's asleep.
Are these explosives?
If you don't want to be alone, I can make you a company.
Anne doesn't have sisters.
Tom's got small hands.
He arrived two days earlier.
Was it a good trip?
He made me a suit.
Men make houses, women houses.
Where's the bathroom?
They usually come home before us.
I don't know what to say.
I'm your brother.
I won't be able to get Tom on the bridge.
If I were you, I'd be asking for this job.
The patient was released from the hospital.
My Internet connection's slow.
We need to keep working.
Hurry up, we're gonna be late.
How long do you have to wait?
I'm smarter than you.
I was fascinated by her opera singing.
You'll find him.
Don't fall in love with me.
Who's with Tom now?
His concert was very good.
There's another number of tourists here.
The door clicked and closed.
I'm hungry!
It's easy to talk to Tom.
The brothers of the twins are totally similar.
Don't hang out with Tom.
I didn't understand the smile.
I'm hunting you know it.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want to come with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Would you say that again, if you like?
How much money do you have?
Oh, I was sick.
I have a lot of bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Given how long I've been learning French, I should be able to speak better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit, I'm a little nervous.
You want to buy a shirt?
I think you have the right not to let Tom go.
Tom accepted the invitation to visit Mary's feast.
You're not the only one there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends happy.
I'm angry with myself.
It's made by Tom manually.
You won't believe what things people throw away.
I stopped smoking for a year.
Don't wear a lot of luggage when you're on a trip.
I got Tom's picture here.
I didn't tell you everything.
They're working both of them.
Tom's not welcome here.
You blame her for lying to him.
It doesn't make sense to be fooled, you know she's playing games with you.
George's very enthusiastic about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He must be given advantage before the others.
I've got you over.
Take it with you.
Just wait a minute.
I swim once a week.
I was waiting for an hour and a half.
He played me publicly.
The bulb's burned.
Tom worked very hard.
How much money do you need?
Oh, I was sick.
We're in position.
Reduce it.
How about dinner together?
I think you lied to me.
That's incredible.
Where's the bus terminal?
If it wasn't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
That's the picture I made to Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I've never spoken French to Tom.
We all thought Tom could speak French.
Tom's back inside.
Who's Tom talking to?
I'd like to learn more about the museums.
This shirt needs to be washed.
You won't believe it.
I'm looking for my house.
I don't feel good.
Why early?
He decided to go abroad.
I don't blame you.
I'm a nightbird.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, don't you?
Do whatever you want, but I'll interfere with it if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I have to trust Tom.
I think on vacation to learn to swim.
Where's the beach?
Are the Giants playing tonight?
I feel like he won't let me freak out so easily.
It'll be 5:30 in a minute.
The school starts at eight and a half.
Tom's bathing.
The beach is not far from here.
Ken jumped the wall.
The top of the mountain is covered with snow.
One hug from you will make me happy.
When are you going?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
Right next to the beach, there's a really good restaurant that I think you'll like.
What made you think so?
I'm coming.
He missed the last train.
I looked at the picture.
You had no choice but to wait for her.
I totally wiped you out of my memory.
I haven't said no yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
You mean French?
I've never seen you so nervous.
What's the minimum salary in Lithuania?
Here's the hospital I was born in.
Whoever sows winds, he will harvest storms.
According to the latest count, the country's population is smallly more than seven million.
Temporary measures will not have any effect on drug addiction.
I don't know where I left the keys.
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Convicted to death.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, can he?
I don't have anything.
At least once think with your head.
I thought you might be hungry.
This is the beginning of the new era.
I have to put my shoes on.
I'm thinking about it.
Don't you have anything else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you pick up?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We had to obey their request.
Choose the one you like.
We'll know soon.
You look tired, so go to bed early.
That was really stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I don't have anything to suggest.
I'm talking to my French servants.
This is my sister's picture.
Tom's hard to deal with people like Mary.
I've tried all of them.
He gave her one advice.
The room was so smoked that I couldn't breathe.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He definitely loves you.
I lost my wife last year.
Looks like she doesn't feel good.
Did Spot go too?
I promise to bring it back.
I have relatives in Boston.
Get out of here!
Tom's wearing a slipper.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I have to go talk to Tom.
How about we study together in the library?
I have a job to do.
The job proposal is still in force.
Your shirt's missing a button.
I need to get out for a while.
Your green is good.
Squeeze your fingers.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Can I see this one?
Uncle gave me this clock.
Real friendship is forever.
Tom's used to working on the open.
Tom pressed the trigger.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
You're kidding me!
Let's go back.
I'm on the bus.
Tom learns French every day.
In this store, they are dealing with kitchen benefits.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom didn't answer right away.
You're expected to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works in that baker is nice.
Please, get me another cup of coffee.
Alice may come.
How do you do that?
I had a good time.
I'll stay till the afternoon.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not my fault.
Any of your team speak French?
Looks like it's gonna start raining.
I've never seen one like this before.
Come here as soon as you can.
I've never climbed to the top of Fuji.
You don't play golf, do you?
Tom doesn't work anymore.
It's probably nothing important.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom jumped.
What's the minimum salary in France?
I forgot her name.
This political problem has caused explosive debates.
Eat on one living frog every morning, and all the rest of the day, nothing worse will happen to you.
Tom won't be happy to see you.
Unemployment is growing.
Last night I couldn't blink.
Russia loses 20 million people during World War II.
I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
Nancy smiles.
If you're going to France, you need to refresh your French.
I understand what you're saying.
I never trusted Tom.
I'm learning French at school.
That's what he said.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I won't be able to tell you what happened.
I think you should give up.
Please have patience.
Your joke is far too far.
I had a very good time today.
Christopher Columbus was drinking unfiltrated seawater.
I want to be a French teacher.
I'm glad I don't need this.
They're all hungry.
The Japanese have black eyes.
Tom's a professional baseballist.
Tom wished he was still unrelated to him.
I have three kids.
Let me sleep another ten minutes.
Uncle gave me the clock.
All horses are animals, but not all animals are horses.
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
Last week, I ate pizza every day.
I promise to bring it back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have any gum?
Looks like you're wrong.
His daughter has become a beautiful woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom's on his desk, he says something.
Do you want coffee?
I'll call you for Tom.
I opened my check account.
He was here at that time.
I put my shoes on right now.
He felt uncomfortable in his father's presence.
Your shoes are untied.
Tom shouldn't be here.
He took off his coat.
I can swim in the river.
Are you working French every day?
Don't make that noise, please.
You're pretty good in French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one thought his words were important.
That's a strange problem.
I don't understand that.
Where do you live?
I didn't know what to do.
It's time for lunch.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom got six.
I did it for you.
I've seen you somewhere.
They'll play basketball after school.
Those clothes are good for you.
I couldn't say no.
That's surprising.
I heard someone come in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did the bus go to the museum?
I need to discuss something personal with you.
He was transported to the hospital with a helicopter.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
Your neck's shirt.
Are you coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played with Tony yesterday.
Jill's engaged in Jack.
I wish you luck.
He was alone at home.
In the Esperanto, the essence ends with "o". A multiplied number is formed by adding "j".
Tom wants to be a doctor when he grows up.
Don't I get a hug?
I'm older than any other student of my class.
I'm buying tapes.
We'll need Tom's help.
How high is your brother?
Come to our guests.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Jane's in serious trouble.
It was a perfect day.
I haven't taken a shower for three days.
The triangles don't have four corners.
Are you sure you want to know?
I accept your offer.
What's the minimum salary in Romania?
Brian left the door open.
Tom, wake up.
How are you going to come home?
I wash my clothes.
I've heard that French is a difficult language.
I haven't really been fed.
Soon you'll stop thinking about her.
Let me take a look.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom's working for a big company.
Say hello to your girlfriends.
Let's ask.
Get upstairs and go to bed.
Come on, touch him.
That's my job.
Don't touch the ball on the door.
How many years have you been learning French?
Carol's back to her hotel.
Do you like that color?
Please be brief.
I haven't seen him yet.
The mountain is covered with snow.
Let's get out of here.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
He got off the train.
Mary's dating two at the same time.
There's no sign of Tom yet.
Give it to me.
Did you do everything you wanted?
You'll have to wait and see.
I was awakened at five.
I was afraid I might have been late.
Tom says he can connect to the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Don't talk to me now.
What are you saying?
I'm looking for something not that expensive.
Tom is much easier to speak English than French.
I think you'll be surprised.
Next time I'll make more effort.
I've done my job already.
He's a hero.
I don't have any requirements.
Her charm is a mix of joy and kindness.
I should have listened to you.
I have cake hair.
I'll meet you at the park.
I've never won before.
It's a little left.
I like that color.
My grandmother was surged in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I've seen you and Tom.
I don't think it's true.
I got three cameras.
Ask them to call Tom.
We all regret Tom.
I hope I have a chance to return your favor.
Tom sneaked the drawer to see if there's any chemical that he could use.
This requires careful discussion.
Tom won't believe it.
I need to learn the truth.
I think you should meet Tom.
We ran after the cat.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I wish I was young.
Be more precise.
The French Tom's really pretty good.
Isn't the time great?
I don't feel embarrassed.
I don't want to belong to the elite at all.
I've seen you on TV.
You need to learn hard.
I'll be back soon.
Ask Tom yourself.
Tom explained the details.
Don't let Tom get away with it.
He was playing football with an empty can.
I think you'll really like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm a vacation this week.
My French teacher is at my age.
You better put your sweater under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process has achieved good results.
That's what his ignorance is understood.
You're absolutely right.
Everyone knows his name.
My French isn't good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are these criminals?
Can you get six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We'll make him a goodbye party.
What club are you members of?
Acushi may have been sick.
Tom didn't get on the bus.
Some books are worth rereading again and again.
We're working together now.
Go back to your place.
He finished Cambridge with a distinction.
I have to get her back tonight.
I have to start preparing.
Is Tom learning French in school?
What are the shoes going on?
We definitely worked hard.
I'll delay my journey to Scotland until it warms.
He started to be justified.
How old are you?
It's all right.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't make me do this.
How big are your kids?
I'll stay until tomorrow.
Please call the doctor!
I think Tom can share your feelings.
I gave up.
You and half don't know.
That's the picture I made on Tom's house.
She gave him something to eat.
I'm starving!
I'll help you get better in this.
My dad's going to run every morning.
I saw Tom walk on the beach.
My brother became an engineer.
How much money do you want?
Don't get up too fast.
She gave up all her dolls.
I didn't say anything.
What are you gonna do?
I really appreciate it.
I knew you'd be busy.
Go away.
It's a big town.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Kim's dressed very attractive.
Don't want me money.
Tom hates school.
There's no problem creating a web site, just be careful not to violate someone's copyright.
Tom protected his wife.
She has a wonderful handwriting.
The fingers on the hand are five: thumb, indicator, middle finger, nameless and poor.
The folio is made of polyethylene.
I've decided the problem with the ease.
Did anyone notice that?
She's a little shy.
Are you sure you don't want me to call Tom?
You're young, but I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
How much taxi gets out of there?
You both look very young.
You're absolutely right.
Is that yours, Tom?
I don't have much English books.
We have time until tomorrow morning.
I like your shirt.
The enthusiastic began his worthy respect for the beginning.
I've seen you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
At first, the local cowboys laughed at him.
Looks like he's in a hole.
I think you should come see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
Be more accurate.
I'm holiday this week.
You're laundering your socks.
I promise not to do that anymore.
I just gave blood.
He doesn't know French or German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
I don't doubt his sincerity.
Please open the package.
I'm buying.
I have no idea who he is.
Would you please tell me your name?
Such mistakes are inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Is he watching the game?
This is your home.
The losses were difficult for both sides.
I'll follow your instructions.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something hot for drinking.
Tom tried to convince Mary that it's time for her to leave.
She's grinning every morning.
Don't forget the party tonight.
Do you prefer to speak French?
Wow, that's cool.
Don't make me cute eyes.
I don't have any money.
Mily eats bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't do this without you.
Tom's not used to living in town.
Take a look at Tom.
Jane went out to shopping.
This cake is nice.
I told Tom why I couldn't go.
The long fields are now demode.
He's doing very well with kids.
Come in, please.
We were really having fun.
Tom hates this.
It's true she's dead.
Don't get used to it.
Finally, it stopped snowing, and time warmed.
She didn't do very light suggestions what she wanted for Christmas.
Students didn't remember what they read in this book.
I learn French every day.
I heard every word.
Where did you take off your socks?
Let's go to the movie.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some poisons used correctly are useful.
What are we gonna eat?
Keep it secret.
You make me feel so guilty.
I'm angry with you.
Let's do it.
She gave me permission to use her vocabulary.
He's three years older than she is.
Don't hope so much.
What's the price of this rain?
Mom, would you give me the toilet paper?
How'd it go?
I think you'll find him.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you've changed the whole room.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom showed Mary a few effective ways to learn French.
I'm not good at sports.
The judge sentenced him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to succeed.
I found that he's a chemist genius.
It can't be like you're walking over and over there, starting to harass people's address.
I had an appointment at 2:30, but I got in a bullet, and I couldn't make it in time.
They went to the sea museum.
Tom's doing a lot of effort to improve his French.
It's been lost for a long time.
They didn't talk.
I didn't call you stupid.
I'm talking French today.
Can you tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not that bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it in.
We're all connected.
A word of support when you fail is worth more than an hour of praise when you have succeeded.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
It was done.
His shirt was scratched with sauce.
Tom found Mary's story for interesting.
Mary Tom won't get any help.
You're not going to be protected anywhere.
She was wearing a skin coat.
I promise not to do this anymore.
I made anne doll.
What have you finished, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
The story is very interesting to me.
I've read that book.
It was a good year for you.
He was cleaned up.
I can't do that.
I'm a French teacher.
I want to buy Tom's gift.
One thing is sure, no one can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly man.
I was convicted.
Tom was told recently that he had cancer.
Tom's home with a bus.
For me, a meeting this afternoon is a better option.
What do you have to do?
Tom's been studying French three hours last night.
Put your hand up.
What's that?
It was too easy.
I travel often.
Here's the hospital I was born in.
I never liked biology.
I owe you so much for your kindness.
Let's divide the prize 50 by 50.
Squeeze my hand.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think you better get down.
I haven't seen Tom since his birthday.
I need to know.
Do you like traveling?
Your plan failed.
Tom made a big party at his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced to leave school.
I just finished breakfast.
I have to go help Tom.
It happened once.
How long will you have to wait?
Tom's the guy who told me when the meeting will be.
I appreciate your cooperation.
The soldiers started coming home.
I have a problem, I need your help.
Let's get on the bus.
Are you coming or not?
Tom didn't want Mary to play with his kids.
I forgot to tell him.
Nancy looks so tired.
I really appreciate the offer.
Don't talk about people behind their back.
She's reached an adult age.
Let's go for a walk with me.
I'd love to watch the movie.
Whoever's well ready, don't worry.
I was fun watching TV yesterday.
Do you have a hobby, Tom?
These are trees on whose leaves live silk bugs.
Who speaks French better, Tom or Mary?
I have news for Tom.
Are you sure Tom's behind all this?
Please don't let that happen again.
The sticks hurt me.
I tried everything I know.
Why do people fear her?
He's been fighting hepatitis for six months, but it seems he's recently started to recover.
The universe is a mystery.
I'm back in Boston.
Where's your father?
What's the account?
A man came to see me yesterday.
I'll be in my lab.
Can you tell me your room number?
I suspect Tom has no idea what Mary did.
Patients often die just because they go ahead of their diseases.
I wouldn't think the tofuto was so delicious.
Are you jealous?
Who's planning this trip?
What time is it now?
Then what does it mean?
I haven't been through my lighting yet.
He's asking you to help him.
I've only been to Boston once.
I don't know where yours is.
He could change his mind.
Do you feel guilty?
Do you think so?
He learned to swim.
Can't you really swim?
New York is a big city.
I'm too low.
I was hoping to get back to the beach next weekend.
I'm running out of the veins.
I can't do it alone.
I hope you're right.
If you tell her about this, then she'll tell her her best friends, then her best friends will tell their best friends and eventually everyone will understand.
She was cold.
Tom's talking with a French accent.
I've never seen the long.
Ken can swim, can't he?
Tom and Mary went to the moonpark.
I thought it was best not to say anything about it.
I'm not a student.
Are you looking carefully?
A few minutes later, the phone ringed.
She wasn't even there.
Jane's from Australia.
Close the door, please.
Tom finally left.
Tom assumed Mary wouldn't come to the party.
That's the sweetest baby I've ever seen.
I'm not mean.
In this restaurant, the food is nice.
I'm not doing that.
Are they confused?
You parked in my place.
I don't know where he is.
Unemployment creates it.
I have to get my son at 2:30.
Sugar's cute.
Where are you going?
That's a great poem.
The prices have been down lately.
Tom's an interesting man.
Are you trying to take me off?
If you're late with the control transmission, it won't be accepted.
I'm a little busy right now.
Are you worried?
Calm down.
Tom wants more money.
Is this your family?
It was a terrible day.
I don't live with Tom.
Do you still love Tom?
I won't be able to move Tom on the other side of the bridge.
Where do we go?
You can't be mad at me for that.
I grabbed the cat for the neck.
Looks like he's gonna win.
I think you need a vacation.
It can't be what it looks like.
I think I found something better.
There were a lot of frogs in this pond.
I understand it perfectly.
Depends on the context.
Did something change?
I'm not that brave.
He prefers French than German.
You can read French, right?
Fred's often late for an hour.
Don't cry, you're not gonna fix anything.
Who's thirsty?
The girl's eating bread.
I love parties.
I don't know what it is.
I can't buy you this dress.
I heard him go down the stairs.
A friend's coming to see you tomorrow.
I hope that happens.
Maybe Miss Satow sent the flowers.
Take us to the center.
The sea was calm.
She's an atheist.
Tom was impatient and nervous.
I need a new USB cable.
You're driving too fast.
Can I trust you?
It's hard to please Tom.
How long are you gonna be mad at me?
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Why'd you run?
What's your favorite bird?
You can study here.
Let me help you.
You'd like it!
I'm afraid I've hurt you.
There's nothing to worry about.
This is my house.
He's deprived of experience.
I didn't know you were cooking.
Tom didn't pay any attention to Mary.
Put these shoes on, please.
I heard it was nice.
Tom doesn't like that color.
I feel safer here.
I want to be young again.
Tom refused to go.
He's with blue hair.
I don't know when he'll come.
Mary told John the secret.
In the next semester, I'll learn French.
Tom won't speak today.
See you tonight!
I'm out of money.
I got him a cup of coffee.
Where's your babysitter?
Nothing happens like you thought.
Why don't you want to wear a tie?
Children must obey their parents.
Is there any mistakes in this exercise?
Can you come in Sunday night?
I remember we've met before.
I look at him as my best friend.
No one answered the phone.
I've seen you somewhere before.
You're learning the esperanto.
The new bike cost me 50,000 yens.
I think you're crazy.
Keep it up until later.
They're the best friends.
You're a problem.
You're so surface.
I have great news.
Looks like it's snowing, isn't it?
That's a long story.
We solved the problem.
Does Tom know where Mary was born?
He decided to go there.
I hate her, but I don't know why.
Tom seems objective.
The tunnel went down because of the earthquake from the last day.
I need to talk to you about Tom.
Mary spoke Japanese slowly.
What are you doing all this time?
My uncle never writes letters.
Close the goddamn door!
We used to ridicule him about this.
John came over a week ago.
He refused the offer, too.
Oh, I forgot my keys.
Excuse me, I have a request.
The shaveman is a man who shaves the beards and shaves the hair of men.
Do you like Mozart's music?
That's my problem.
Is this yours, Tom?
We're not all that stupid.
Any problem can be solved if you are stubborn and patient.
Tom started learning French three years ago.
You have a phone.
How old are you?
Tom's working there.
I'm not her type.
Are you free tomorrow night?
He lives around here somewhere.
Tom loved singing, but no one wanted to hear him singing.
Tom didn't lie down on the ground.
I think we can do better.
I think you should think about it.
I'm not meant.
I'm the most ordinary office worker.
He was in France.
Don't let that bother you.
Have you ever seen the kengur?
Tom can't figure out how to open the box.
I think Tom's serious.
I'll tell them I'm not coming in time.
He's frequently going to school.
The socks smell.
When are you getting married?
It's a phasen.
He got off the train.
You're cruel.
How many episodes have you been watching?
Her name is known to everyone.
I think you're perfect.
Is it a big difference?
You can take pictures outside the museum, but not inside.
Let me go.
You're cute and sweet.
My sister lives in Yokohama.
I think you should make a deal.
It wasn't my intention.
I have to get out of here for a while.
She loves the color of her shirt.
Hey, man, I beg you so much, scratch a little insecticide behind the refrigerator.
She denyed me that I didn't answer the letter.
I'm tired.
Your English is getting better.
It's your turn.
Put another pair of socks in your bag.
Shortly after that, it started raining.
I have to go back to Boston tomorrow.
They don't want permissions.
Tom sent Mary a message written in French.
I'm glad you're happy.
When the conversation is over, he says goodbye and wishes me a good evening.
Let's check.
You've done a good job.
I made dinner last night.
Tom can't stand up.
It's hard for me to concentrate today.
Thank you very much for your cooperation.
Who told you my name was Tom?
Aren't you impressed?
Tom's not here today.
I have to buy one of these.
She helped him herself.
I have a job for Tom.
Where did you throw them out?
As usual, physics teacher is late for hours.
Let us clarify what is right and what is wrong.
I forgot to turn off the lights.
Can I take a picture of you?
"Can I park here?" "No, you can't."
I've seen you somewhere.
You sat in my seat.
I've already tried this way.
You don't speak French, do you?
I'm ready to order.
Students shouldn't use this toilet.
You got into a winning series.
I want a drink.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She doesn't have time for anything but to take care of the baby.
It's nice to meet you, too.
The movie wasn't as interesting as the book.
Let's go!
I don't want to be worried.
I don't think Tom's number is in the point.
Can you do it yourself?
Thank you very much for the detailed explanation.
I'm the only one who knows them.
She's coming to her after dinner.
These containers are closed hermetically.
He's the best player in our team.
I've seen you before.
There's none.
I want more information.
Are you wearing a weapon?
He says he escaped the danger by pretending to be dead.
Are you home?
Can you tell me what to do?
Be careful with her.
Don't shoot, I'm out.
Isn't that surprising?
He's friends with everyone he met.
You need to learn harder.
I'm sorry, but I don't believe it.
I just don't understand that.
He broke into a house.
I arrived later than the usual.
We're not disappointed.
She was frightened.
I was your mother's first friend.
The quarrel has ruined our unity.
How much money do I take with me?
Tom's good with the French.
I'm falling for these stories.
I'm used to it.
Welcome to Japan.
She's just shopping.
Don't forget, it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
"Who are these socks?" "My sister."
I think you should call Tom.
She was a tall blonde.
I gave Mary a book.
His doctor said not to eat between the main food hours.
Are there survivors?
The shelter sticks her legs.

This is my friend Tom.
They've rigged each other.

We're going down to the next station.
Tom asked Mary to meet him at his office tomorrow.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom's with a light skin.
Thank you, that's all.
The engine doesn't want to start.
I'm early.
Let's go to closed.
Jesse immediately accepted the invitation.
Jack Nicholson grew up in New Jersey.
Is there a free will?
I'll be there.
I think that's Tom's motorcycle.
I have to go see Tom.
It's been a long time since the last so nice surprise for me.
Let's play Canadian.
I think we have enough time.
Yunko is a nice girl.
Let's have lunch.
I've been waiting for him so long.
Aren't they cute?
I can't change these plans.
I'll be home soon.
He was traveling at work.
I had a little temperature this morning.
The medication's working.
I can't go anymore.
Tom has a very big nose.
Is that the right direction for the museum?
The school starts at eight and a half.
It happened twice.
Deep breathing is healthy.
When was the last time you went to the beach?
We freaked out of worrying about you.
He can't read.
You're doing a good job.
The debate won't solve anything.
Maybe I'm wrong.
I hope that will make it easier to understand the meaning and memory of the newly learned words.
I think they know us.
I don't intend to hurt you.
Can you introduce me to a doctor who speaks French?
Are you sleeping?
Our team was with red bottles.
How about a walk on the beach?
These dogs are big.
Everybody say "sir."
Tom won't pay him.
The rain stopped me coming out.
When I was your age, we had to walk upstairs to school, both directions.
He'll be busy tomorrow.
I have no idea what I'm doing here.
Nothing more, thanks.
I've already tried.
I think you're working too hard.
He drank a lot yesterday.
That won't help you.
Just do what Tom says.
The prisoners were released.
Be careful with that.

It was a great day.
How old was he?
It's off!

I wrote to my French teacher.
You're not coming?
I'll stay by lunch.
I forgot his name.
I think you'll be happy.
Let's not talk about it anymore.
Then what's the problem?
She wasn't that hard.
It's business.
Please lock the safe.
She interrupted me.
They're both alive.
I'm too low.
Tom went abroad to learn French.
Tom gave Mary's card.
I think you better stay with Tom.
Tom didn't do it.
That's the job I chose.
I think our gas is over.
Let me tell you something about myself.
We pushed the car.
What's the minimum salary in Germany?
We have something for you.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I don't eat pigs.
Your coming here was a mistake.
The newspaper published the profile of his new editor.
It's been a failure from the beginning.
Why don't we get him a bottle of wine?
Five days after she finished, my daughter flew from Osaka airport to Germany.
The boy laughed at the girl.
Please don't touch it.
I've seen Tom around here.
I have to get in touch with Tom.
I haven't had a bath for three days.
Just close your eyes.
Let's get friends.
I just created a new text-processing program that could make the words in the contrary.
We certainly need Tom's help.

He drinks too much beer.
She's very shy and she's worried when she's somewhere at the party.
I think Tom's a good name.
As long as I'm alive, you won't be deprived of anything.
I heard what happened.
I like your shirt.
I'm telling you, she looks like her mother.
You have to apologize.
How do you know that?
Tom can object.
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I think you better give up.
Parents often make sacrifices to give good education to their children.
Where are you from?
Looks like your dog's thirsty.
You're going to London next week, aren't you?
I have plans for tonight.
I wouldn't bet that.
You don't seem too surprised.
Apparently it worked.
I need to learn Tom about this.
That's a good sign.
Tom jumped through the window.
Let me tell you, it's my fault.
Let me call you.
I gave them clothes and some food.
You're wearing your socks upside down.
I'll get up early tomorrow.

It's too hot.
You're bleeding.
I just want to be with you.
I want to learn French.
She's eating apple.
I think you should check under the couch.
My car was stolen last night.
Tom wasn't at the party.
Are you satisfied?
Why don't you get some rain in case?
I really want it.
Maybe I'm wrong.
Are you done with breakfast now?
It wasn't my fault.
Read it again.
He arrived earlier than usual.
I talked to him about this on the phone.
I think you're very talented.
The flights were almost empty.
They need more research.
It's your responsibility.
Come to our guests.
I have to push my bike because one of the tires has fallen down.
This shirt is a standard size.
Don't make fun of me.
I put my hand on her shoulder.
From the store to the house, I wore a heavy baggage and cried up a ho-o-op-hop.
What languages do they speak in America?
That's incredible.
Listening to the news, she fell down.
Don't be disappointed.
He fell asleep in the morning.
If you're not pleased with the service, don't leave the tips.
I'll remember tonight.
They don't pay me enough.
I got up early yesterday.
In the last two months, Tom kept moving from place to place.
I think you should go out.

This basic school has a strong football team.
How can Tom not like you?
Hitomi seemed very happy.

That's probably the key Tom's looking for.
I had to walk there because my car crashed.
It's still happening.

I owe him a thousand yens.
How can I find you?
Nick owes me ten bucks.
I don't want to work under these conditions.
Don't punish Tom for this.
I've never seen you so scared.
Tom noticed three points.
Do you like walking around the beach?
When are you going to leave?
Anybody with you?
Tom couldn't believe what's going on.
Did you have fun last night?
Speaking straight, he's wrong.
They're already here.
He's sitting in the kitchen.
I'm bringing her back.
When does he close the art museum?
I was busy this week.
You're coming from Sweden.
I thought we'd have breakfast together.
Swallow it.
Tom's teaching athletic psychology.
What do you want?
Looks like you've changed the whole room.

I think you're perfect.
The army should have retired.
Your success depends on whether you'll take your STEP test or not.
I've always wondered if you'd come back.
Tom never talks about his feelings.
He raised his hands.
One coffee, please.
I haven't heard from Jane since she moved to Tokyo.
It was raining like a brown.
I think you'll be impressed.
He thanks me for coming.
He's lower than Tom.
Can you drive?
I can't speak English, not speak Spanish.
Someone must have stolen your watch.
Tom grew up talking French and English.
What are you doing now?
The museum deserves to be visited.
Tom's gonna be gone for a week.
I'm looking for a gift for my father.
The problem doesn't deserve to be discussed.
It was pretty cold.
"For here or for home?" - "That's here, thank you."
Bob's home too late.
The elevators don't work.
You want the courage to do that.
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
I took her to town.
Anyway, you'll never know.
Believe it or not, the breasts and baddemes are one family.
Do you want to hear something funny?
There aren't enough chairs in the conference room.
I have no idea.
Tom wasn't perfect.
When I was a university student, I never slept the night before the exam.
I really want this.
I learned a lot of Spanish words today, and now I know how to say "booze", "beard" and "knee".
In the winter, I'm sleeping with two turkeys.
Let's split it.
I'll go around.
You can go.
I've never seen these pictures before.
Tom's hard to deal with in such situations.
She didn't like him.
He has a strong body.
Are you scared?
Everyone knew Tom could speak French well.
Tomorrow's Sunday.
Tom can't see without his glasses.
Are these nuts?
Something's moving down there.
I wouldn't blame you.
Maybe Tom wasn't wrong.
It was done.

Make sure you're not late.
Are you involved?

Why is Tom angry?
He speaks Japanese well.
The director's thinking if he can fire Tom.
I'll be with Tom.
"How many candles have squeezed on your birthday?" "Firty-six."
The green socks are tied on the hand.

Tom has bad news.
Where did Tom say we should go?
Go wake up Tom.
I just finished doing my homework in French.
I'm looking for my pen.
Let's have dinner.
I'll visit him tomorrow.
This guy was an asshole.
Tom likes to wear white socks with his sandals.
It's in a rush with my principles.
I don't know why Tom is so angry.
What are the facts?
I'd like to scream.
I'm the one who saved Tom.
I've seen you somewhere.
She translated the letter from Japanese to French.
Am I fired?
Did anyone see you?
The village is far away.
What made you mad?
How do you know that?
I forgot.
He's in a pussy.
I don't know what to do next.
There's no electricity since morning.
There's a hole in my pants.
Tom's doing extraordinary.
He's really speaking well.
I think you're making a mistake.
I've never heard Tom complain before.
They're probably drunk.
I'll show you where to go.
I don't have a personal space.
We have something for you.
I just finished my homework in French.
Tom just made it.
I didn't expect Tom to be there.
How old are your cousins?
Your French has improved significantly.
What's in your suitcase?
At the end of March, we'll get married.
He raised his hands.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Good luck to you.
I think Tom was trying to warn us about something.
He married a nice girl.
I took care of it.
Don't you show interest?
That's something quite different.
His brothers, his sisters, or he himself will go to the station to meet his father.
I gave up Tom.
He disappeared without a lead.
You're very brave.
Speaking of travel, have you ever been to Cobe?
I have to go to the market; I'll be in an hour.

Are you sure you don't want to come?
Can I have the bill, please?

We want our own house.
I have to say that.

I plan to study abroad next year.
Can you count to a table in French?

I need to find another one.
You have to leave now.
The snow was on the knee.
I feel bad today.
It's so sad to watch Tom ask for money on the street after he lost all his money on the gambling.
I've never seen anything like this.
You're not the only ones there.
Do you understand me?
Do you speak Turkish?
I put it in your room.
There's no one home.
He still wants to come.
We need to postpone the feast.
Tom looks great.
What could Tom do there?
I think that's Tom.
Exactly what I said could happen, it happened.
I was trained in this school.
Good afternoon.
I think that'll be interesting.
How long does the shuttle get to the airport?
Tom thought Mary was untied, but he wasn't quite sure.
Go to the park.

It's in the kitchen.
Any questions?
The lightning hit Tom's house.
The miracles are called miracles because they don't happen!
It's too big.
What's the minimum salary in Australia?
I'm just curious.
The city is located in the bottom of the mountain.
She's a lot higher than I am.
It's getting harder.
Tom opened his eyes and saw Mary.
You're going to London next Sunday, aren't you?
Do you wear money in yourself?
Why didn't you tell me before?
I'll be back next week.
Stay with me, Tom.
The old man gave a shelter to the kid.
See you later.
I'd like to live near your house.
I think we were lucky.
I have to end this.
You're so surface.
It won't change anything.

No one here ever tells me anything.
I gave every single gift.
The museum doesn't work on Sunday.
Your answer is wrong.
She remembers Mr. Black's car.
They put Tom in jail.
My mother feels better.
Tom just got home.
Don't put it on the rain.
They're talking very fast.
What time is it now?
Can I eat this orange?
Mary likes romantic comedies.
What are they drinking?
Let's be friends.
As far as I know, he must have been born in Italy.
"But really?" "Yes, really."
Don't tell anyone.
I'm surprised this building still stands.
I need to meet Tom.
Although sometimes Tom's English looks pretty good, he has no idea where his possibilities are spread and it's impossible to convince him that he's wrong when he makes a mistake.
Are you John?
America needs you.
You have to decide.
I saw a lot of tourists on the beach.
I heard you fighting with Tom.
Are you going to respond?
What's your home address?
Outside the dog, the book is a man's best friend, and in the dog it's too dark to read.
It doesn't work.
My mother made a very nice sex.
You have to start now.
It's an old letter.
Are you involved in some publicly helpful activities?
Do you care?
Obviously, Tom was known before he released that album.
The Romans would have no chance to conquer the world if they first had been required to learn Latin.
I paid $50.
Don't drink this.
I think we better get out of here.
Aren't you married?
That's what you always wanted.
I'd like you to translate this document to French.
Tom was fired.
Clean up the table now!
Mary's interested in politics.
She won't believe it.
Do you speak Turkish?
Don't hesitate to ask questions.
Bees make honey.
Tom doesn't want to admit he doesn't know how to do it.
I'm the only one who knows them.
In this city, they've been getting iron for 350 years.
I'm playing a TV game.
He was in Japan.
Let's take a walk.
Are you still collecting postmarks?
My name is Ichiro Tanaka.
Last year, imports exceeded exports.
You don't have the temperature.
Did anyone tell you that?
I'm not afraid of death, I just don't want to be there when it happens.
Don't let him do it.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
I put my coat on the table.
This is the place.
A woman in a wheelchair is hiding in a supermarket.
This is your last chance to spend some time with Tom.
Can you speak French well?
What kind of man would do something like that?
I don't like snow.
Jane was waiting, washing her back in the tree.
Thank you, we'll do the best we can.
Let's get upstairs and talk.
Tom didn't call me.
Tom doesn't like chess.
Those clothes are good for you.
I've been studying French for three years.
I think you should go out now.
Please leave.
I thought you didn't like Tom.
Tom seems really happy.
Until yesterday, I never heard Tom speak French.
She's French.
The soldiers are used to dangers.
I know a little French.
Please write your contact address here.
Have a nice appetite!
I knew you'd find Tom.
We arrived first.
Will you make it?
The police found a body thrown out on the coast just away from here.
We all speak French.
The gentleman knows the value of his own life.
I appreciate you coming to pick me up.
See if you turned off the TV before you fell asleep.
And my hands were shaking.
From now on, be more careful.
Tom jumped into the cold water.
Are you registered?
If there's no life after death, you better do something with this life.
I hope it's okay for you, Tom.
Let me help you.
Don't let yourself be used.
I think you're the ones who need help.
The corridor's slippery. Watch out.
Languages such as Russian, Polish, Czech and Bulgarian have common Slovenian roots.
Tom's got to do this now.
You shouldn't say that to your parents.
Let's talk to each other honestly!
She's the woman I gave the gift to.
Let me go alone.
I don't understand what he said.
This situation is funny.
This land is on Tom.
I think you should meet Tom.
Don't add annotations.
He's not here yet.
Your soul will be mine!
Many of my friends can speak French.
He plays a good guitar.
Have you played Myncroft?
Nancy's afraid of dogs.
You'll be surprised what people think.
Are you taking any drugs right now?
The tree's burning.
I heard every word you said.
I haven't agreed yet.
I have to admit I'm sorry.
Jack speaks English.
I want to see you.
I'm not jealous.
We were going to drive.
Can I get your coat?
My father's gonna make me a delicious feast tomorrow morning.
My television's broken.
Tom just shut the phone.
Are you ready?
I won't believe it until I hear it from Tom.
Tom can't see you.
I'm hunting you're busy.
Come see us.
Looks like you've had a hard day.
Tom doesn't give up.
But I want you to understand what I'm saying.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe that at all.
I haven't spoken to Tom yet.
Are you involved?
What did you do with the camera?
I continued to take a picture.
Today less teenagers work.
Why am I still listening to this?
Please don't.
Tom's handwriting isn't very beautiful, but it's readable.
Shoichi's face is faded.
Electrical stream can generate a magnetic field.
Do you mind if I turn the radio on?
I've got things to do tomorrow.
The tower was broken on the puh and dust.
America is very big.
I heard it stopped the car.
Send her my greetings.
Is your wife blonde or is she brunette?
I'm out there. I'm driving my bike.
The men were taking the boy to the hospital.
They talked too fast to find out what they said.
Tom's injured!
Are you sure Tom knows what he should do?
Can we trust her?
That's the camera that Tom made the photos with.
Let's watch TV.
He killed that man.
Do good to those who hate you.
I have to go.
What's the whole story?
Don't push me.
What are your plans for Christmas?
Another bottle of wine, please.
It's time to go to work.
You were given a chance.
Would you put the dishes in the wash?
We found where he lives.
It's not that deep.
He's a great scientist.
She wants a divorce.
My new magazine seemed very interesting.
Maybe we can help Tom.
We went on a trip full of hope.
I'll be here.
Don't wood me.
I think you're really amazing.
I think Tom's injured.
Tom helped Mary move the closet.
Tell Tom to explain.
What's your relationship with him?
I'm Tom Hunter.
That's a little weird for me.
Can you do it yourself?
Spring days get longer.
Mary let Tom kiss her.
I've never seen you cry.
Sometimes I hear my father singing in the bathroom.
In Singapore, it speaks English.
I eat bread.
That request was rejected.
You were right.
He was tired, and yet he went to help them.
Tom's not going to school next week.
Do as I say.
Kids are tired now.
You want to watch a French movie, right?
We played for winning.
What's in the coffee?
The bulb's burned.
I have to get Tom's money back.
As many books he has, as much as I have.
They didn't find Tom.
Are you sure you don't want to wait until tomorrow?
I'll always remember your goodness.
This smell and the other time I felt it.
Everybody's dying.
I don't understand.
Give me a knock.
He hates shopping.
I think you'll be happy.
I didn't tell him everything.
I don't want her to give up.
Mary's a book worm.
I think you're capable of anything.
He objected to her plan.
I don't think we should do this.
You're not gonna be alone.
Looks like the dog wants to eat something.
This box is a little harder than it's supposed to be.
This is a famous mountain.
I could make you happy.
He told me how to get to the museum.
He likes to go fish.
Is Tom still at school?
Texas is almost twice the size of Japan.
Either you do them, or you!
I hope it's not too late.
His clothes always smell bad.
I think you should listen to me.
I forgot your number.
I've only been there once.
Put your jacket on the hanging door.
Tom lives three blocks from the shore.
He's a little famous.
I love pizza.
I'll try it again.
Just answer the question.
Leave it for another man.
Tom admitted he was scared.
If you listen a little more carefully what the teacher says, you'll probably understand.
I think you should check under the bed.
The movie wasn't as fun as the book.
The job didn't drag me.
I think you're perfect.
Each human being is part of the whole, called Universe - part, limited in time and space. It perceives itself, its thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest - a kind of optical illusion of his mind. This illusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us within our personal desires and commitment to our nearest people. Our task is to free ourselves from this prison, expanding the circle of our compassion, so that it covers all living creatures and nature in all and beauty.
He will certainly come.
I'm familiar.
You're not going?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
Should I fill this form in French?
This local newspaper is published once a week.
I don't know who he is.
It's almost three hours.
I want to know more about you, Tom.
He just became the director.
We're learning French.
I think Tom and Mary like each other.
What's that thing?
Never give a dog food to your cat.
I have a problem with French grammar.
I got him in the face.
I'll make you happy.
You won't believe it.
Do I have to open everything?
Now it's totally different.
You're always late.
Let's keep going.
The walls were painted in light brown.
Betty killed him.
Have you started learning French yet?
You can't read French, can you?
Your blouse is very good with this sex.
Can't you do something?
Lucy's from America.
Do you really want to work in Boston?
Tom's not lying down.
Are you involved?
It's very big.
Tom just got back from Boston.
Ask again later.
He's my older brother.
She's become famous.
She refused his invitation.
We pray for peace.
I think you'll be very interesting.
I didn't insult you on the stupid guy.
He and I are friends.
Our best friend is a doctor.
There's something in Tom that pissed me off.
Both Tom's parents were teachers.
Don't play baseball here.
Is Tom alive away from here?
The bad time didn't let me go.
She's a sweet girl.
Bob is a nice man.
Looks like he's happy.
I've got scratches on my feet.
Why is this so funny?
Follow my example and take a glass of wine.
Are you John?
I forbid smoking in my room.
I need to figure out when Tom's going to leave.
She read the letter.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
He shot me.
The dogs are allowed.
Everyone thinks of a change in the world, but no one thinks of changing himself.
She wants to get divorced.
You need to learn hard.
Did you accept his invitation?
If you don't want to be alone, I can make you company.
I heard shots.
I didn't mean to put you in an uncomfortable situation.
Who did you translate this for?
If he has a wish, there's a way.
I think Tom made a big mistake.
If you relax and rest, you'll feel much better.
Are you done with breakfast?
I've got some old computers.
Tom was wondering where she spent her childhood, Mary.
Are you coming or not?
Do you speak Georgian?
And Tom and Mary pulled out their weapons.
Are the cats dreaming?
Do you know that girl?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
This is the hotel where Tom usually stays.
Tom was sweating.
You better not go.
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
Let's go ask her.
We usually speak French.
I'd like a blouse that fits this jacket.
I have no idea what Tom said.
He's a kind of star.
I thought Tom might be your boyfriend.
You always complain.
The milk's soaked.
The second lesson is very easy.
I love your name.
We have to protect our children.
I'll stay home.
Take one of these.
What's your relationship with him?
The devil's custom must be forgotten.
My brother said he wasn't afraid of the darkness.
Tom really hates him.
The problem was, I had nothing to tell him.
I think Tom was really having fun.
I wouldn't do that.
Why don't you take off your coat?
Let's talk seriously about your future.
I have a few calls, too.
Whatever happens, we'll make them talk.
Would you be so kind to close that window?
The old couple went on a trip around the world.
When I woke up, there was no one at home, and I was abandoned all day.
Mathematics is my favorite object.
What day do you usually rest?
Tom's back to get his coat.
I'd better go see what Tom found.
Tom's back home targeted with mud.
Did you actually try?
The storm storm prevented the plane from flying.
Tell me you got some good news.
What browser do you use?
I remember what he said.
What's the minimum salary in your country?
I think you should think about it again.
I missed you so much.
What kind of reader are you gonna get - Kindle, Nook or Kobo?
Is this your book, Mike?
I usually run every surrine.
The bell rings at 8:00.
Mr. Smith is accused of a pass in the contract.
Ken runs faster than you.
They talked.
Are you sleeping, sweetheart?
She gave birth to twins.
Five gallons normal, please.
I haven't been here much.
Watch out.
That's very big.
I think you'll be surprised.
Do you speak German?
Put on your coat.
I bought some books from the bookstore.
Be loved.
There was a terrible accident yesterday.
He answered the questions correctly.
Put your tourist shoes on and don't waste time.
Why are you here so early?
If it's sued by your great shade, you seem to have spent most of your vacation on the beach.
It's probably going to snow tomorrow.
I have no idea who Tom is.
Laura may have been sick.
Tom knows what's really going on.
Tom can resist.
She was perfect.
I have to keep trying.
There was an art museum in this area before.
I thought your feelings might have changed.
Sooner or later, his luck will be over.
It looks like it's going to rain tonight.
Anne doesn't have any sisters.
Is it really so hard to speak French?
When was the last time you were on the train?
Tom saw him, too.
I'm not trying to push you.
You're running.
Don't stay in bed unless you can make money from bed.
Tom's got to do this now.
I could make you happy.
My dear, if eating isn't ready in seven hours, I'll go to the restaurant.
He let me wait long.
I'll be right away.
They made us work all night.
He likes English.
I heard about your party.
They need to change their attitude.
Do you want me to repeat the question?
The book is interesting.
She was young.
They're hiding in the closet.
What's the minimum salary in Russia?
He loves her.
Try to figure out when the train goes.
You need to deal with French more seriously.
I want to go there again.
It's a big nonsense to say that.
They have to pay in advance.
Do you like music?
He was born and grew up in Tokyo.
I'm pretending to work.
She waited till the water shuts up before she made her tea with her.
I think Tom speaks French well.
Tom has to go.
He was very patient.
There's no chance they're coming at this late hour.
The teacher claimed that in three months he would do so that we all could speak French without sniffing.
I caught three fish yesterday.
He goes there every day.
There's been a disaster.
Have you ever heard anyone speak French?
And no one say anything about what I told you.
We want to rent a apartment in town.
I think you should come down here.
We arrived yesterday afternoon with a train.
Tom's gone, but Mary's still here.
Choose your favorite rocket.
I'll buy you a sushi.
Come on for today.
My brother claims he's not afraid of the darkness.
Save a man, eat a cannibal.
Everything looks fine.
Are you sure you don't want me to help you?
Tom speaks French horrible.
Don't you accept credit cards?
Tom's drinking water.
Did he offer you?
You want me to help you?
You don't have to go.
Please give me an envelope.
What is Tom afraid of?
You always sing.
I totally forgot about Tom.
I wouldn't be so sure.
My father was on his way to leave when the phone called.
He asked about you.
Ken never went to Kyoto.
His fog stopped seeing away.
Anne's a cheerleader.
I'm trying to learn English.
Tom went to the mail to send a letter.
Look carefully at the wall map.
Maybe it's not enough.
Don't send me any more notes.
Are you sure you don't want to drive?
I think you'll be very interesting.
I haven't seen you for almost three years.
I haven't had a shower for three days.
I lost my shape.
Get me a chair, please.
It wasn't a stupid idea.
Maybe you'll be happier at another job.
I like your shirt.
That's very important.
Thank you for your work.
Drive straight on the road, and when you cross the lightfall, you're there.
Do whatever you want.
Some people would definitely ask, why don't we just get together and get out of Afghanistan?
Take your socks off, please.
I don't waste the ammunition.
I'd like to get your picture.
Please take him away.
"What's your car?" "Ford."
I tried to be your friend.
The second cousin of his wife was a member of the Jewish Governing Council.
Would you help me translate this?
America has enemies.
Did you see Tom?
We'll be back.
Give it back to me!
Say hello to Jimmy from me.
I haven't spoken to Tom for three weeks.
Stop screwing up.
I know what Tom is doing here.
I know a man who speaks French well.
I think you were wrong.
He didn't mind staying awake all night.
You probably already know about our company.
I think you've asked enough questions.
Tom doesn't need to know that.
Some people have an inconvenience to travel through the sea.
My plane leaves at six o'clock.
I don't know any of the boys.
We're ready to go.
That's evidence.
It's really delicious.
As long as I'm alive, you won't be deprived of anything.
Maria showed us their home.
I heard steps, but I didn't see anyone.
Is that our problem?
He gave her a sheet.
Uncle gave me his car.
I really appreciate that.
Tom put his helmet on.
I've never seen anything like that before.
I have an opinion.
I did it myself.
My name's Emily.
Nothing else worked.
I have to get dressed.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
I haven't figured that out yet.
I need to talk to Tom.
Last night, the game was exciting.
The width jackets are the last screaming of fashion.
Don't get lost.
With a little good will on both sides, our problems should be resolved.
I don't have much money.
She quickly climbed up the stairs.
The house we used to live in was broken down.
I'm getting married next Sunday.
The prices will continue to rise.
We learn French together.
In high school, my French was my favorite object.
Would you call Tom?
Nobody knows if he loves her or not.
Get me off this side of the lightfall, please.
I think Tom's hiding from Mary.
Oh, I was sick.
Show us it.
Why don't you laugh?
Have you ever congratulated PfirsichbÃ¤umchen in German?
There's been an accident.
I would never hurt them.
I know about this research.
Wouldn't it be nice?
I don't know French, and Greek, completely.
He made it clear that he was against the plan.
She can jump high.
Why am I so sleeping?
She answered the tears.
When will you leave?
Hanako has grown higher than her mother.
That's quite different.
The elephant's gray.
I'm studying French at home.
Don't make that noise, please.
Did anyone of you ever see Tom?
I'll go alone.
He's stronger than you.
I'm dangerous.
Show me this list.
That's all Tom has to do.
Our son's getting married and we want to make our heads up.
Don't go to that building.
Why isn't Tom at school?
Will you eat that cookie?
I worked hard last month.
I knew he'd accept.
Don't leave town.
I heard Tom and Mary talk.
We met in London.
Do you have any wine?
This could be a little bothering.
Looks like our water's finished.
Take whatever you like.
I have to tell Tom.
That was very personal.
Do they both understand French?
Something was taken.
The green matches Alice.
Our shit is gathering three times a week.
They caught the fox in the trap.
You're early.
You love kids, don't you?
I felt isolated.
What do you want?
I'm sad.
They're late for the storm.
I guess it won't be a problem.
Speak slower, please.
"Where do you live?" "I live in Tokyo."
I'm busy right now.
I feel so bad.
We were soldiers.
The effort is not only necessary but also the pleasure.
We need to be careful.
It's 11 already.
I run every day.
I think that's Tom over there.
How was the last weekend, Nancy?
Do you learn French?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I'm not unreasonable.
I have to report this.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
You need to use a dezodorant.
When I stand up, you're the world.
Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
There are some things I need to take care of.
I never question his honesty.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not going to do this.
You don't seem too surprised.
This is a warning that we need to take seriously.
What does the fox say?
We'd like to eat, can you serve us fast, we'd have to go to one and a half.
Let's get a sake.
Tell me a joke.
Tom practices speaking French every time he can.
I've seen Tom do amazing things.
The apples are red.
You have nice hands.
People are generally against war.
Your hair needs a haircut.
I'm better.
Tom hasn't met me before.
May I see your driver's license?
This will never end.
Tom teaches me French twice a week.
Why don't you just tell us what's bothering you?
Maybe they have something.
I could make you happy.
Who hurts your tooth?
We learn French.
What makes you think that?
You sat in my seat.
We know who you are.
Do you like black cats?
In school, we learn French every day.
Do you believe in miracles?
I think you'll be quite surprised.
Tom looks lonely.
Let me tell you something about myself.
I haven't seen Tom since I was 13 years old.
Her hobby is to collect postmarks.
I don't have anything.
Have you ever painted this house?
If we were expected to speak more than listen, we would have been given in two mouths and one ear.
Don't play baseball here.
I got your coat.
Last night we had a great time.
I'm going to Detroit.
You won't believe how popular Tom has become.
Did you do it?
My father often takes me to baseball games.
Are you brothers?
I felt very uncomfortable because I didn't speak French.
Tom's friend threatened to leave him.
Are you afraid of something?
He hasn't known anything since he left for America.
I'm gonna have to handle this now.
I had my hands in my pockets .
I would never hurt them.
What's your son's name?
I've never seen you so nervous.
He's become a big musician.
I'm counting on you.
Aren't you nervous?
Have you heard from your sister recently?
They're all hungry.
She went down the stairs.
I was alone, I was studying.
I didn't tell Tom.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
I think you'd better sit down.
Our sales are down.
I saw Bob this morning.
Get me something to eat.
If you haven't paid for non-conservation, please send the long amount and allow us to remove the problem immediately.
It smells like a toilet here.
I'm here on vacation.
Looks like you're alone.
It's a matter of consideration.
Tom was saved by a random passer.
The town is in the center of the city.
They're not hungry.
Call me if you need me.
Let's change the subject.
The bar is full of people.
I'm so hungry.
It's very kind of you to get away from your way to help me.
Tom decided Mary's story was interesting.
How about we stop the car and rest?
Tom lives in the same part of the city where Mary lives.
Now it's a little after 11 without a quarter.
Both sentences are right.
I've never seen the darkness before.
We need to call the police.
I have information about Tom.
I'm sure this book has never been translated to French.
I'll see you again.
I'll try it again.
No one could sleep tonight.
Runda went on about five minutes.
He was circling the country.
The sum of all corners in the triangle is 180 degrees.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
Mary can speak Japanese.
I need to call Tom.
It's a little cold today.
I'll judge you.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Who let the dogs go?
I don't feel sick.
I can't even read French, but what else to say?
I'll do my best.
I'll come with Tom.
Mike's swimming very well.
Be careful!
I want a boat that will take me away from here.
Let's talk.
Diamonds are the girl's best friends.
Since he was young, his parents died, so he raised his uncle.
I've seen Tom do what's impossible.
I have to warn him.
Where's the station?
Don't throw anything out.
What's going on up there?
The dog couldn't lay.
Is it safe?
He's asleep as a baby.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
I'll follow your instructions.
I have a sharp knife.
You painted the walls, didn't you?
My mother teaches flower arrangements.
What a wonderful time!
Don't waste your youth, or then you will regret it.
I think you'll be interesting.
But isn't he above the law?
A modern factory is completely automated.
Don't let Tom scare you.
It's hard to adopt English.
I think you should join us.
Can I open a can?
I didn't do it on purpose.
I haven't seen Tom lately.
I think Tom's leg's broken.
Tom told me he wanted to live on a lonely beach.
Why did Tom want to learn French?
That's where Tom was born.
Where are you born?
I asked him to send us a book.
I have no idea what's going on.
You're all fools.
They exchange gifts.
I personally don't mind.
Mr. Kott's Japanese food started to like.
I put the money in the safe.
We're in a hurry.
Tom heard something.
I hope that's enough.
You need to take this into account.
This one's okay.
I was your mother's first girlfriend.
Tom teaches me to speak French.
Would you like to tell me something about yourself?
I think that's very unlikely.
I want to find my account.
I'm sure Tom knows enough French to get better.
I went to swim in the river.
Mary's Tom's older sister.
I don't know any of the boys.
Guests have to start coming soon.
I'm crazy about football.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
It was very nice to meet you!
This isn't your house.
I didn't see anything.
Hey, I just got here.
I'm a hero.
Damn you!
Tom pushed Mary off the edge of the rock.
I hope Tom's right.
Aren't you happy?
Prepare for the worst.
Fruits the dirt beneath the sun.
She's always late for school.
Tom made some mistakes on the control.
Time's on my side.
Aren't you happy?
It could take a while.
I thought you could get out of here.
Let me help you put your coat on.
Watch out, the car's coming!
She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this sweater?
Take it with you.
Now I remember, you don't have to smoke in her car.
Nancy smiled happyly.
He's only four minutes away with a train.
What is Tom trying to achieve?
Can someone trust you?
It's a little fat.
I think we should go.
Tom said it probably won't take too much time.
What's the real reason you don't want to do that?
Can you keep a secret?
Hey, guys, keep quiet!
I would never hurt them.
I taught French.
Can't you stay a while longer?
We stayed in Dorchester.
Are you depressed?
While we were on vacation, a neighbor took care of the cat.
Both Tom's parents were teachers.
Children need to listen to their parents.
It's misty today.
Do you live in this neighborhood?
They made us work all day.
I think you're capable of anything.
He came home after he was away for ten months.
We're moving to Boston next week.
I've never met Tom before.
I called him yesterday.
Let's rest here.
I need to see Tom.
I think you should leave.
I think we're intriguing Tom.
I'll get the next bus.
Tom's twice older than Mary.
Mary has two boyfriends.
Kate speaks English very quickly.
I'm not so tired.
You've got the infection of the venice.
He started writing a novel.
He's satisfied with the result.
Hurry up and you can catch your train.
You won't need that anymore.
Get it back where you got it.
Let's start.
I screwed you up.
Tom found out Mary was stealing money from the casino.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little early.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So you did it anyway.
Can you do it on your own?
She's red.
Do you think I'm so stupid?
If you give someone $20 and you never see it again, then it's probably worth it.
That's Jane's bag.
Tom always smiles.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary's attractive?
What's the minimum salary in India?
Don't make a decision on this issue today.
She didn't have much money.
You sat on my seat.
When did Tom die?
These two shirts are made of the same material.
Do you learn French?
You don't have to give up English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
What's Ken eating?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
Next year we're going to college.
What are you eating, fish or meat?
I made my check account.
I thought Tom had a holiday.
Why isn't Tom here?
What's Ken doing now?
There's a lot of words for DNA, but there's no one for RNA.
One of my parents has to go to the meeting.
Thank you for paying attention to this.
Don't mess your nose.
The wind was blowing.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her big daughter is married.
Tom speaks French much better than any of his classmates.
For 20 students, only one read the book.
I've got a job on Wednesday.
Where's my grandfather?
The Japanese have the tendency to trust firmed authority.
I went home with a train.
I think I can do it in my free time.
Shall we go out?
They call me Bob.
In what situation would you do that?
What was the name of the guy he was dating before Tom?
Try it again.
I'd like you to translate this letter to French.
I'm really tired and I want to go to bed early.
The French Tom's very good.
I'm not a philosopher.
She lives in New York.
He must be the director of the school.
I bet I'll get there before you.
He was painted like a clown.
In her presence, I'm uncomfortable.
She bought him a dog, but he had allergy to dogs and they had to give it to others.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
There was no television or radio at the time.
She went to the taxi museum.
Watch your job!
He wrote a letter.
I can't agree with Tom.
Those socks have holes on the heels.
Tom likes to plead.
You're a good doctor.
Don't you ever say that word again.
I saw him stop.
She felt her knees trembled.
Edison invented the electric lamp.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
I'll meet him some other time.
She wasn't that strong.
What a strong wind!
That's my CD, isn't it?
I told you not to look for me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He's dating a group of kids with whom he shouldn't.
It'll be okay if you don't get involved in your personal affairs.
Do you have to go to the mail?
My veins bleed every time I use the end of my teeth.
We've arrived fast because the movement wasn't loaded.
You must be careful.
What do you miss?
He came back from France recently.
Molly has a big clock.
Tom's not helping me.
I haven't been to him for a long time.
Those glasses are good for you.
What did you miss?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
He's not eating until he gets over.
I would never lie to you.
Kate's watching a dog.
I don't know everything.
I'll never do that again.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
His friend is a former senator.
Is the French harder than English?
This pair of shoes aren't good for me.
Are you afraid of something?
I have two cousins.
The lists are falling through the fall.
Don't you do anything?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
We can't postpone the meeting.
Since when does Toim learn French?
He was completely exhausted.
Thank you for coming!
Hey, I'm a little sick.
I'm so embarrassed.
Looks like there's over two thousand words in Uigura in Tatebeba!
Tom's stubborn.
We can't postpone the meeting.
I'm ashamed of doing this.
Let's cross here.
I know that's hard.
Are you an exchange student?
If you need help, ask.
You've always been a little weird.
Do you think you're going to Tokyo tomorrow?
I hope it's worth it.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true that Tom and Mary were arrested?
If mankind doesn't care about the environment, the environment will destroy mankind.
No, thank you, I'm just looking.
I felt like I was dismissed among these people.
I think you're gonna have a good night.
Don't take it back yet.
Sorry to interrupt you.
That he's too generous is his greatest shortage.
Press the Shift button.
You understand, don't you?
Jane always acted like she was very rich.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yeah, I know it.
I wonder what Tom meant.
It doesn't cost anything.
I don't mind the hot time.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new cards.
I'm thirsty.
The flowers are wiggling without water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to know why Mary didn't like him.
See, I told you Tom couldn't swim.
I forgot.
The account, please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Guess what he told me.
The salt's over.
She forgot to feed her dog.
That's not the problem.
Go and meet him and let that letter out.
This chicken hasn't taken any eggs lately.
I hear Tom stole a car.
We weren't hungry.
The dolphins are very intelligent.
Did I disappoint you?
Wait for me to finish, please.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
He's very happy that his life in school goes well.
Mrs. Yung wouldn't mind if I visited her unexpectedly.
You have nice lips.
Many people will lose their jobs because of the car industry's screwing.
He came to help me.
We'll start the landing down in Honolulu.
I heard you were looking for me.
Our food's finished.
The moment of glory for Hanshin didn't last long. They were quickly moved from the first place.
Is there a big house?
Doesn't that lead to trouble?
He was upset that he was called a fool.
Their condition is getting worse.
Do you really want it?
Will he fail in the test?
I can't understand why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What are the conclusions?
Here we are finally here!
I'm higher than you.
I think I'm lucky.
Tom could have lied.
I feel good.
She pressed the button.
I didn't feel good, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
I need to move.
He's a famous composer.
Tom put a chicken on the kitchen window to cold.
Happy is the man who married a good woman.
Tom gave me a good advice.
He always tells the truth.
I can't live like that anymore.
Oh, how pathetic!
Say hello, Jimmy.
Does it taste good?
Are you going?
I heard what happened.
Of course, she's right.
Don't make me shoot you.
The equator divides the Earth's ball into two hemispheres.
It was personal.
Isn't he interested in you?
It's a great pleasure for us to watch baseball matches.
I think it's good to take a little rest.
When did you start learn French?
She solved her hair in front of the mirror.
I've already done my job.
It wasn't easy.
Do you think it'll rain today?
You're very brave.
There's a bag on the desk.
Where did you throw them out?
How is Tom going to deal with the problem?
The thief got out with the money.
I haven't spoken to you before, have I?
Tom was late for dinner.
That's the picture of my new house.
I want to sleep.
This camera is Tom's, right?
I sent her a doll.
I'm smarter than she.
Uncle gave me the clock.
Please excuse me for the delay.
I felt isolated.
I'm very busy.
They're very important.
Are you Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I know a man who can speak French well.
Smash that sweater.
I'd better stay home.
That's not very funny.
The phone is something you can't do without.
I contacted them a few days ago, but I couldn't get the answer.
Why is your mouth open?
My dad's driving very well.
We need to protect our children.
I'll see you again.
I'm totally exhausted.
I'm just looking at things realistic.
I heard you encouraging them.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
In the summer, I'm going to go to France.
Please mix the cards carefully.
Get on the bus for Budstrasse and get down on Zeestrase.
Laughter is useful for your health!
That's not a mistake.
I guess you're Tom who everyone told me about.
Add this site to "Preferred".
When the sun of culture is low, even the dwarfs and the dwarfs throw a big shadow.
When is the museum open?
I've seen you somewhere.
He was sitting on his sandwich.
We just cleaned the bathrooms.
Tom and I have an appointment at the mall.
I'm not going to surrender the threats.
You're in a better shape than I am.
Do you have a bowl?
I hope it's useful.
He tried it himself.
I'm from the FBI.
Tom's working for me.
He's standing up late.
Tom's fine.
I walk like a penguin.
Don't change the channel.
Watch where you step.
Can I get your knife?
You have to pass the report by the end of this week.
I haven't seen you for almost three years.
Are you armed?
I wish you had told me earlier.
Don't look at the camera.
It's raining, but we'll go anyway.
Tom and Mary didn't speak French.
I did it once.
He didn't listen to my advice.
There were a lot of people on both sides of the street.
Don't make me regret that.
I thought Tom would cry.
She's her friend.
His clothes always smell.
I want to eat something.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
We're like brothers.
I can't even put the water in a pinch, I don't think I can burn a turkey.
What's the name of that river?
Is she free for you tonight?
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
In the winter, the six are covered with ice.
We're almost out of time for dinner.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'm a full-year-old now.
I want to go.
Get her back!
I'm not telling you to go alone.
I want orange juice.
I would never lie to you.
I wouldn't be surprised if Tom left early.
Tom speaks French as a French.
I think we need to make a deal.
I'm just buying a soft toilet paper.
I don't have a problem with that.
Where's the ticket?
I'm really busy.
I think you should go home.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you'll need this.
I hate flying.
What are the other options?
Get me something to drink.
Am I going to die?
I took a little while dancing, and climbed on the table.
I trust you.
How many brothers do you have?
I think you'll remember that.
Please turn this to the pounds.
I think Tom lied to us.
I'd like Tom to smile more often.
I just want to sit on the beach and rest for a week.
I'm thirsty.
The bus was shaking in the inequality road.
Tom has the right to know.
The wind of you.
She took her test.
I'm going to study the library tomorrow.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you do that?
I've met him before.
Tom never gave up.
Tom hasn't been in trouble.
I made a few mistakes on the test.
This book is not Tom's property.
Where was that?
I have to take it off.
Can I do something to help Tom?
Take off your glasses.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work at the hospital.
Tom's already a mature man.
Let's not be fooling.
I'm fine.
It's not art, it's a teeth vagina.
I haven't seen you before.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
Take one of these.
You're so responsive.
Have you heard of him?
She washed the blouse fast.
Anybody with you?
The museum is open for visitors.
Is Tom really trying to win?
My grandfather likes to read.
Did you know you were wearing different socks?
He's making a copy.
What color is Tom's car?
You deserve to be happy, darling.
Tom had a single wish.
Please tell the truth.
Tom went out with Mary Friday night, and with Alice Saturday night.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
You can't read French, can you?
That's exactly what I want.
Letter paper.
Some of Tom's students speak French very well.
I can't hear anything.
I'd better make sure.
I'm not gonna be able to help you.
He went out under the car.
He writes to his mother from time to time
Men get in shape driving a bike.
This is not the end of history yet.
Don't hurry.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Let's get some rest under the tree.
You can improve your English if you want.
Bring me a dry towel.
Jim's name is James.
Is there any other hotels you can recommend?
This bike belongs to me.
You're kidding me!
We need more research.
Are you sure Tom's alone?
You'll never be alone.
Is there a similar expression in French?
Are you talking to me?
You're my best friend.
Anne's a little girl.
Just squeeze your fingers.
I went to the park.
I love playing basketball.
The train arrived with ten minutes late.
She lives in the deep province.
Excuse me.
I don't waste the ammunition.
You're my best friend.
I organized a meeting.
I didn't tell anyone about us.
That was just stupid.
Are you sure?
Have you ever read any French verses?
Ken didn't run.
I paid the video for five contributions.
I just want to move with you.
She got twenty-one.
I heard it coming out.
My stomach hurts, Doctor.
You don't understand.
What does that mean?
They come from Sweden.
Be careful when you cross a loaded street!
A man has to work.
That's intriguing.
What's your nationality?
That part is good.
Merry Christmas!
Come down.
Mary's running.
They're thirsty for the city life.
I'm glad you made it.
The dog was circling around the table.
I'll be in my office.
I think we should call Tom.
It happened between eight and ten hours.
Tom wasn't fat.
We're all friends here.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Tom came in a rush with a letter from Judy.
I heard Tom kissed Mary.
I think Tom gave up too easily.
I heard Tom and Mary discuss it.
To eat sushi.
Drop those socks, please.
Please be more careful in the future.
Tom was obsessed with a panic attack.
Can I open a can?
He was a baseball player.
Don't say anything like that.
He came after you left.
Did you eat breakfast?
The room's completely constructed.
I admire you for your courage.
I'll check upstairs.
Tom's traveling to first grade.
Don't stand outside too late.
I'm taking my day off tomorrow.
I didn't say that either.
It's better to give than to take.
Can you take this if you like?
Jane wrote the letter herself.
Can you solve this task?
I think that's enough for you.
You told me that another time.
It's been six years since I started learning English.
I can't buy you this dress.
I work like a bee.
Brian made Kate wait for him.
I forbid you to smoke.
I noticed that Tom usually doesn't lock his door.
Would you help me translate this?
Tom almost doesn't understand anything French.
This is the same hospital where Tom works.
Tom's not that smart.
Why do you want to be a nurse?
Carl seemed very happy.
Linda loves chocolate.
This climate spends a lot of electricity.
Don't be bound to this hunting propaganda.
Tom thinks the death penalty should be cancelled.
First the good God made a man, and then made the woman; and then He regretted the man, and gave him the tobacco.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you like it?
Guys, don't make any noise.
Don't look them in the eye.
I'll be back in an hour or somewhere.
Does that look familiar to you?
Take your coat.
What kind of money do you have?
It won't change anything.
The building's almost finished.
I thought they were unemployed.
I'd better get to work.
Aoi dance.
Today, machines can do a lot for people.
He went for a walk.
Please start now.
I've seen your driver's license.
Where's my room?
Tom's suffering from a flat-deployment.
Keep digging.
Where's the museum?
"Human foolishness is infinite," I say, and because of this criticism, I consider myself exceptional.
The storm didn't stop, on the contrary, it was getting stronger.
Tom made Mary translate the letter to French.
Unemployment is still high.
Tom thought Mary wasn't coming to the party.
I didn't talk about him.
Is that what Tom would want?
The whole road's going down the hill.
Aren't you ashamed?
I think you should send Tom to Boston.
Ask Tom again.
I wish things were as they were again.
Show me.
Tom got his teeth out last week.
The more you run, the more you're tired.
Don't hide how you feel about it.
Anything for me?
Can you open my door?
The girl's an Irish girl.
It'll be a challenge.
I'm sure this won't be necessary.
Tom's often sick.
The key's not in the lock.
What's the minimum salary in Italy?
Tom's on the lamp again.
This bike is mine.
I'm not used to eating angry.
Pick what you like.
Go there and talk to her.
We met at a summer camp.
Don't talk in the classroom.
That's not from me.
When my father realized I was dating Nimrod Nick, he was very angry.
The teacher made us repeat the word.
Tom died yesterday.
I thought we'd have breakfast together.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
I think you'll find out Tom's fault.
She put a sweater on her.
Sometimes I'm out of money.
Don't worry, Mr. President: with so bad veins, she hardly even had teeth.
I've never seen you here before.
I think Tom's gonna die.
He lives in a comfortable little house.
Go back to bed.
Why didn't you try your dress before you bought it?
Tom killed himself jumping off a rock.
Where are you born?
Those clothes are good for you.
They went straight to their goal.
The boy got in the window.
I haven't started anything yet.
The account, please.
I thought you'd be happy.
Are you done with dinner?
I heard Tom gave you his grandfather's violin.
Do what you think it's right.
Are you in love with Tom?
Persistence is repaid.
They arrived separately.
Speaking French is fun.
Tom won't succeed.
Prepare for the worst.
I believe the Earth is observed by extraterrestrial intelligence.
Let's go to the beach.
I think it was a mistake.
My father's walking in the park.
You're not that old.
He gave each of them a pencil.
Don't bother me, I think.
I think you should let your beard go.
Do you like the French?
Looks like they're ignoring us.
What's going on here?
Are you sure you don't want another alcoholic?
Many people share my vision on this matter.
The blouse's clean.
A little tea, please.
I have a stupid question.
He finished his great start at last.
I have to stay here.
He doesn't have to work.
You just missed the train, didn't you?
The child is not a court to be filled, but a fire that must be burned.
I think you should see this.
Don't you speak French?
Order the words in alphabetical order.
Tom can speak French much smoother than I am.
I'll hide in here.
She took care of her sick husband.
He was playing while he was walking.
I looked at the girl between the crowd.
I could make you happy.
I can't speak English. I can't speak German.
I don't have insurance.
He graduated Yale with honour in 1921.
I think I have a way to save you for a while.
My name is Roberto.
I opened the door and kept it open for Mary.
From the milk, we make cheese and oil.
How many episodes of One Piece have you seen?
I didn't think about it.
I'm a vacation this week.
If a sick woman squeezes a thousand paper sheets, her desire will be fulfilled.
I'm surprised this building still stands.
I don't owe you anything!
The bus driver didn't see a walker.
Why did you leave?
I want my shirt back.
I spent my holiday in Hakone.
Take a look at these documents.
I'd like to translate this to French.
He didn't say a word.
They drink tea in the hall.
Tom fired the engine.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Looks like he was a very good athlete.
Give her some milk.
You're screwing 300 grams of rice.
Isn't that enough for you?
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Your bike is better than mine.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
Watch out.
How do I get to the airport?
Who pulled it?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
We're guys.
The bad time has prevented us from leaving.
Now I'm learning French.
Because I didn't know where to go, I asked the bus driver.
Did you get what I sent you?
I'm so busy.
How did you learn to speak French?
Be there tonight.
You got into a winning series.
I can't be mad at you for that.
The spread of television has significantly deprived us of our time to read.
I'll take it forever to explain everything.
Don't get in my closet.
The new coronavir is very infected.
Every time I'm looking for you, you're gone.
You're coming down to the next stop.
Wait a second.
I'm informal here.
Don't look directly at Tom.
Are you sure Tom won't be here by 2:30?
Tom taught me to surf.
He doesn't believe in God.
All I want is a cup of coffee and a baked bowl.
I have to fix this.
I made breakfast.
He follows English literature.
The knife's stupid.
She looked at me very much.
It's forbidden to smoke in school buildings.
I'm really tired and I want to go to bed early.
We love you more than anything.
Why are you here so early?
Some people can speak well, others are good listeners.
I didn't understand the last word.
Whatever she's rich, she's not happy.
Go and look at me.
Have you seen my glasses anywhere?
You can meet him.
Close your books.
I heard someone's coming in.
Tom went on his father's way.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
Tom turned to me in French.
He can speak Russian too.
Japan has a lot of different characteristics.
Do you believe there's a god?
I'm walking with the dog tonight.
What's your blood group?
Ten houses burned.
I shouldn't have let you do it alone.
Convicted to death.
I only waited five minutes.
Will you show me your photo album, please?
Tom's house burned.
The biggest happiness in life is to love and be loved.
How much is your daughter weighing?
Tom shouldn't have done this.
I'm atheist.
I never write the words "borsh" and "shie" in German!
I went to the market.
Tom's knees were touched.
I'll come back to the hotel with you.
Give me some milk, too.
I think she's over 40 years old.
Do you wear the driver's license?
I don't need your help.
He's at the door.
My business is reinstating.
The keys are on the table.
I'm headed to the park.
He reported the police crash.
I don't see him.
Your parents speak French?
I'm afraid you can't talk about a promotion now.
You've always been a little weird.
You're not afraid?
I haven't spoken to anyone today except to Tom.
I can't hear you.
You don't have to go out.
Can you turn off the light?
He's drinking an average amount of coffee.
I'm disappointed he's gone.
You're wearing your socks upside down.
We just got information from Kansas about your brother.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm studying French.
Does this new model have it on the market?
Do you know Mr. Brown?
Don't expect everyone to like you.
What's the matter, actually?
Be careful of Tom.
We can't live with 150,000 yen a month.
You're disturbing me.
She got the ticket without giving anything.
Many people think the retro cars are pretty expensive.
The GNP for the third quarter exceeded by 1% of the previous quarter.
I'm sorry, I have to study.
I forgot to tell you what to bring.
Can you even see anything there?
They were all at work.
I'm out of gas.
Let's ask him.
Where's your father?
I'll do it as you told me to do.
What floor do you live on?
Tom was in my bus.
I waited a month.
I have to go meet Tom.
He was forced to sign the contract.
Not as much as the illness is.
Aren't you scared, Tom?
God is great!
I just feel terrible.
At the end of the movie, she's very different.
Are you sure you don't want to go to my house?
Go back to your bed.
Tom hasn't eaten yet, did he?
My dog's watching TV too.
Come on to work.
Are you sure you don't want to come with me?
I'm not crazy.
He's watching TV sometimes.
I need to respect Tom's wishes.
That's pretty extreme.
It's only 30 minutes until the train's gone.
Participants are preparing for the last round of the competition.
I have plans for Saturday night.
It's like I'm tired.
I hope we'll be in touch soon.

Tom said, "Move it," make your way and sit down.

I need to know.
When's it finished?
I've got it every time I see blood.
Don't!
I thought we could do it by 2:30.

I love tennis.
Do you mind if I come in?
Is it difficult to learn French?
I've been waiting so long for it to happen.
Come on!
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
I'm so happy.
You don't have to say that when there are kids around.
He's eager.
I want to improve my sentence in French.
You won't believe what I heard.
I'll study Tom.
Today the train is ten minutes late.
There's been silence.
Are you absolutely sure you want to do it?
She didn't like it.
You learn French, don't you?
I have to go to a meeting.
I hope we find Tom.
Although I know a little French, I think we should talk English.
She's getting better.
What are you doing on the weekend?
Aren't you nervous?
I need to talk to Tom now.
The drawer's not opening.
Try to calm down.
We need to conduct an interrogation on the date of the test.
Maybe we're avoiding the obvious thing.
Everybody's dying.
Tom is a monk.
I have faith in you.
I'll listen to your advice.
A few days ago, my computer stopped working.
In Japan, almost every family has a washing room.

You're trembling.
I'm a little busy.
I thought I'd go and say hello to Tom.
I think Tom's drunk.
It was a lot of heads.
Why aren't you sleeping?

There's a little chance I'm not able to come to the meeting.

I'm sorry, I don't have much time.
I couldn't understand his ideas.
He knows how to capture his audience.
He'll get to Hakodate tonight.
I'm not a tourist.
A man has to work.
Hello!
They eat apples.
I got her letter yesterday.
I'm very explosive lately. My favorite football team is west.
It was easy for him to talk to the sweet tales.
Tom didn't know what was wrong.
I know you're right.
I need to know what you saw that night.
I've been studying French for three years with a language host.
This isn't my car.
If we don't leave soon, we won't get there while it's still light.
Tom's hurt.
His room is a mess.
They take part of their free time to take care of the sick.
Are you sure you don't want to come with you?
I really don't think Tom intends to go.
Ask Tom.
Put the radio on.
I'll stay three more days.
We've delayed the departure for tomorrow.
Nature doesn't know the borders.
I'm very happy in Georgia.
I'm busy with things.
I hear you think I'm crazy.
I'm a musician.
I need to find out what the truth is.
If John was here, I wouldn't have to come.
You better wear a sweater under your jacket.
I thought you'd be tired.
I think you're an idiot.
How complicated is it?
I heard you laugh.
I totally wiped it out of my memory.
How can I leave?
You can't go into the museum.
He insisted on his own, even though I told him not to do it.
I didn't want to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom's swimming very fast.
Add this site to "Preferred".
I have a lot to say about that.
I love my enemies.
I have no idea why.
That's what you're talking about.
The worst thing is it wasn't always like that.
All the doctor's efforts were in vain, and the man died soon.
I noticed you weren't at your house last night.
It's a threat to us.
You want to buy this sex.
He's a great brain surgeon.
I was cold last month.
He can speak French as well.
Are you going?
Let's change the subject.
It was very interesting at school.
They built the library with new books.
I couldn't speak French.
Can I leave now?
Whatever you say, I won't give up.
I've been running my daily in French for the last three years.
I'm much bigger than you.
He eats only fruits.
It wasn't that funny.
Either he or I'm wrong.
You learn French, don't you?
The girl used to playing only.
I'm playing a group.
The birds sang.
Tom's finished at 5:00.
Although Tom went early from home today, he was late for work.
I'd rather not speak French.
It was awful, wasn't it?
He looks strong.
You're so good.
The time will come when she'll regret what she said.
Think about it, please.

Everything that's not forever is forever old.
You're early again.

I helped Tom make his homework.
Can I help you?
You don't always agree with your boss .
I bought it for $10.
You don't have to go.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
Did you go to the beach with Tom?
I'm getting shot.
Did you hear Tom speak French?
It's a beautiful sunset, isn't it?
You really speak French pretty well.
Say hello, Jimmy.
I heard what you said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should choose Tom.
Something's going on.
Am I clear?
Many parents are concerned that their children do not get basic knowledge of numbers.
I finished philosophy at my university.
What beach do you like to go?
You can always give part of the work of the younger employees.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very beautiful girl.
Tom can't do it.
Whatever you do, you can't make someone believe in something, even less yourself.
I don't feel very well.
Climate doesn't work.
You're sitting in my place.
Is something to scare you?
Everyone agrees with you.
Tom encouraged me to learn French.
I want a MP3 player!
Where's Tom hiding?
I'm shaking when I think about it.
I paid $200 taxes.
I think you should check under the bed.
That won't happen again.
I did it for you.
Stop it or I'll let you understand.
We need Tom's help.
She's an atheist.
There's nothing to worry about.
There's something I need to take care of.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another commitment.
When I first met with Tom, he couldn't speak French.
I've seen Tom do what's impossible.
What the hell is this?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
I have no intention of retreating for a little bit of this clock, and I don't even want to talk to me about split up with it.
He couldn't get the job.
I think you'll do great.
Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a while longer.
I think we have enough food.
I'll be in the next bus.
Mary made sandwiches with an egg.
What did you see?
I wash every morning in the summer.
Put your shirt on.
Read it again.
If I were you, I wouldn't be so sure.
I think you're crazy.
Unfortunately, I haven't arrived in time for his speech.
I prefer greyfruits in front of the orange.
This place deserves to be visited at least once.
He kept reading the book.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I like that color.
Just accept it.
Her sister fixed her blouse.
I told you that another time, didn't I?
Why do you keep saying there's enough time?
I'll visit you tomorrow.
I don't want your gold or your silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like some orange juice.
From the moment I took your book until I left it, I kept screwing out of laugh, and someday I'm going to start reading it.
I tried to fight with Tom.
The folks are squeezing for a round.
And that's what I've seen.
The dolphin is a kind of dick.
What color are these?
He shake his son's shoulder.
Tom heard something and wondered what it might be.
Tom asked me to stay.
I don't want to be dragged.
I'm not taking drugs.
I'm dying to see Paris.
At Mother's Day, I gave my mother the nineteen flowers.
I think you're absolutely right.
If peace cannot be maintained with honor, it stops to be peace.
She bought the room with beautiful furniture.
Job calculators can be purchased at the price of a pair of socks, and thousands of British children are needed in school, not less than pencil and rubber.
This is the hospital where Tom was born.
You shouldn't wait here.
And Tom, and Mary covered their eyes.
That's my baby.
I'll give you all the information you need.
Stop screwing up.
You can't just walk and abuse people.
Don't open those windows.
I'm not insurance.
I'm borrowing money.
She's cooking for college.
I think you're really amazing.
Looks like everything Tom wants is money.
I'm not coming with you.
For the cold time, when you want to drink something hot, I recommend this type of thermos.
Tom runs around like a chicken without a head.
Greece is an ancient country.
Some people visited the meeting.
He dressed his coat and left the house.
The new site of Tatebeba will slide the home "hyper" database, "built from the foundations" of the search engine, and will go to the dad-bux-OS server with the dad's CPU, made entirely by daddybee.
The old man stopped her.
She hated to call her a coward.
I like it so much.
I've never voted.
Where's the bathroom?
Just go to your room.
I'll be back in time for dinner.
I totally forgot.
She gave me a nice gift.
Are you coming?
Let's meet at 2:30.
The crown is the symbol of the kings.
I don't intend to apologize to Tom.
What are you doing?
During the vacation, I read all Milton's work.
What would you recommend to me?
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you were late.
I'll meet him at the bus stop.
Every student was asked on one question.
Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm really worried about your future.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I've never seen you around before.
It's very hot today.
Don't hurry to protect me.
Who's the capital of Greece?
Tom can't speak French, Mary can't speak French either.
I met her for the first time in London.
Can Tom come tomorrow?
Watch where you're going.
They described the girl as a little.
Tom's not used to the city life.
You keep your promise.
I forgot about it.
I think you're putting too much sugar.
Do you like Mexican food?
I'll take you home.
The man is the only animal that uses fire.
All the flowers in the garden went out.
They made us work all day.
We chose him to be the president.
No joke?
I've seen these pictures.
If I hadn't noticed, I would have told you.
What's the minimum wage in Luxembourg?
His fate is pre-determined.
Are these candles?
If you have to choose between the piano and the violin, what would you choose?
The answer is true.
I think that's great.
Did he go through the test?
Don't let the bus go.
Be careful not to break Tom's heart.
We went there for a week.
That's good.
This kind is threatened.
I think you better get to bed.
I like you so much.
I called the bell.
The wolves are moving on the patches.
Do you have medical insurance?
Watch out, Tom!
The museum's closed on Sunday.
I've been teaching Russian for three years.
We're married to each other.
Tom's not going back.
It'll cost about 10,000 yen.
Tom speaks French as well as Mary.
How hungry are you?
This guy's stable.
I almost won.
It wasn't my fault.
Did you cut the paper?
I don't care what's going to happen.
I've seen you with Tom.
Tom's my friend.
You're approaching this in the wrong way.
Something's going on.
Fill it up.
We have a little chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if it's the same for everyone else.
Are you sure you want to throw it out?
Tom speaks French.
The situation has improved sensitively against what it was.
I played you.
His joke was great.
The police will investigate the crime.
The stories that you will read in this book are dealing with some of the many problems that young people face.
Finally we saw each other. I've waited a long time for this moment.
Can you clarify a little bit more?
Am I wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary to hold his hand.
I think we need to look into things.
So we all agree.
If the time allows, I'll go to the museum.
That tie is really good for you.
I think you'll be a great father.
There's no way to contact him.
Never give up, never give up.
Would you like to show me this bag?
This is my computer.
Bern is Switzerland's capital.
You won't believe me.
Can you come in at nine?
Let's synchronize our watches.
I'm marketing every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't do this.
Is this a brilliant store?
I'm looking for a gift for my girlfriend.
And I should have told you, Kell Faidu.
This is the camera that Tom made the photos with.
Make sure you don't get lost.
I'm tired of changing my plans every time you decide you want something else.
It looks like a man from here.
We worked hard to tie the two ends.
Good morning.
John's grandmother died after a long illness.
I have to rest.
She said she wouldn't move inch, no matter who's telling her.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The defendant was given the right to appeal.
Let's not hurry up.
My father went to fish.
They didn't offer me anything to eat.
You don't have to make a quick conclusion.
Don't worry.
He gave up.
The wine is the milk of the adults.
Tom opens the windows every morning as soon as he gets in his office.
I can't work with you if you don't trust me.
That was years ago.
I'm dreaming of nightmares.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
I've seen these pictures.
I'm strong as you do.
I've never been to Europe.
I'm unemployed.
Why don't we take a cab?
I hope I'm not late.
I went home with a train.
Why are you always so bad?
Unfortunately!
Is that why you didn't want to come with me?
Did you decide what you wanted to order?
I made the boy asleep deeply.
She called it something.
Are we capable of that?
My sister's name is Patricia.
I should have opened my suitcase.
We discussed whether to cancel the reservation.
The kids thought their parents were made of money.
The swimmings were creamed.
It's allowed for dogs.
The kids are the flowers in our lives.
I had to cancel my invitation because I was sick.
Tom wouldn't be that stupid.
They hated you, Tom.
Go ahead.
It's a challenge for me, and I learn a lot.
Tom was exhausted.
I counted on her.
Don't look at Tom.
I have to pay for him.
I want to marry you.
Calm down.
That's one of the fish Tom caught.
All right, let's go.
The car's coming.
Looks like we'll be able to get there in time.
Being a troll is art.
I ordered you a beer.
I haven't seen him for about three years.
Let's play baseball.
She's a bodibilder.
The man eats bread.
He's swimming the river.
You don't remember, and I'll never forget.
I wonder why I'm so tired.
