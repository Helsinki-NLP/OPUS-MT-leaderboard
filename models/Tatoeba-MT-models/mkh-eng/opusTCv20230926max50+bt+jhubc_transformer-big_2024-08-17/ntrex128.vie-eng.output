Members of the Welsh Parliament (AM) worry about ‘looking like puppets’
There is concern expressed by some Members of Parliament regarding the change of their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The problem was compounded by plans to change the parliament's name to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of Congress on the floor worry this could be an issue of mixed opinion.
One Labour MP said his party worried that "the phrase would rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For non-Native Welsh readers: In Wales, twp means temporary and pwp means poop.
One Plaid Party member pointed out that the whole Party was "not proud" and suggested other names.
One Conservative MP said his party had "no prejudice" against changing its name, but did not forget to mention how the abbreviation MWP easily turns into a Muppet (puppet).
The Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English letter u.
The National Assembly Committee is currently drafting a bill related to the name change, commenting: “The final decision on any designations of National Assembly Deputies will naturally be of interest to the Delegates themselves.”
The Wales Government Act 2017 gives the Welsh Parliament the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a referendum on proposals seeking a basis for consensus on the parliamentary designation as the Welsh Parliament.
Considering the title of the Members of Parliament, the Committee favours the Welsh Parliamentarian Plan or the WMP, but the results of the referendum show a tendency towards the Welsh Parliamentarians.
Members of Congress are publicly outlining other options, but efforts to reach a consensus could be of concern to the head of the election committee, Elin Jones, who is tasked with presenting the revised bill in the coming weeks.
The proposed amendment would include other changes to the way Congress operates, including rules for delegating members of Congress and designing the bureaucracy.
Members of Congress will give a final vote on what their title should be changed when they comment on the draft amendment.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country’s name
Voters went to the polls Sunday on whether they would change the country’s name to the “Republic of North Macedonia.”
The comprehensive vote was set up in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long asserted that the name of its northern neighbor corresponds to its own territory and has repeatedly opposed its membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a member of the opposition to the renaming of the country, has vowed to annul the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say changing the country’s name is the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Church Bells Fall Into Silence As Crisis Strikes Harlem
“Historically, the seniors I’ve met say that every street corner has a bar and a church,” Adams said.
“To this day, there is no church and no bar.”
He found that the disappearance of the bars was acceptable.
He said that today “people have many ways to communicate.”
“Bars are no longer public lounges where people go on a regular basis.”
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of the properties will not be as sustainable as the leaders had hoped “and sooner or later it will all be back at the starting line.”
He added that these churches could be replaced by multi-apartment buildings with the flats of the crusaders, which would not help in keeping the local sanctuary.
“A significant portion of the people buying apartments in those apartment buildings will be white, and then the prospect of churches being closed down will come faster than ever because there is no reason why the people in those apartments will become parishioners,” he said.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a metropolis for blacks—the Metropolitan Community in the 1870s, which became St. Martin's a decade later.
The first white Methodist congregations moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation worshiping nearby took over the site.
St. Martin’s was taken over by a black congregation under the stewardship of Father John Howard Johnson, who headed a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a shopping mall street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or urging blacks.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild it, they commissioned a bell.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin’s, proudly called the bells “the bells of the poor.”
The bell expert in July lovingly called the bells “a cultural treasure” and “an invariable historical treasure.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first bell in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who pursued the larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's is not replacing him.
What happened at St. Martin’s in the last few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought up by lay leaders in the church, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The diocesan administration — the parish’s governing body, which includes lay leaders — referred to the diocese in July with concerns that it “will seek to transfer costs” to the diocesan administration, though they are not involved in hiring the architects and contractors already mentioned.
Some Catholics are unhappy about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Sharks attack 13-year-old scuba diving to catch lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters in California on Saturday, on the first day of the shrimp season, authorities said.
The incident occurred just before 7 a.m. near the Beacon's shore at Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he was driving with friends for about half an hour that Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and they all swam the boy out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was just a shout of delight when he caught the shrimp, but then "realized he was screaming, 'I'm getting bitten!
I've been bitten!"
The entire clavicle of the boy was exposed,” Hammel noticed as soon as he reached the boy.
“I told everyone to get out of the water right away: ‘There’s a shark in there!’” said Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack has not been identified.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles told a news conference they spotted a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but determined it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles further mentioned that the victim suffered severe injuries to his upper body.
Officials closed the entrance to the beach from the Ponto Sea in Casablanca to Swami’s in Ecinitas within 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles revealed that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not in danger.
Sainsbury's strategy to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s is pushing for Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams with its traditional beauty booths, which are staffed by professionals.
As part of a huge push into the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as fashion and home goods sales decline, larger beauty stalls will be trialled in 11 stores across the country and scaled up in more stores over the next year if there’s any sign of improvement.
The investment in the beauty industry comes as supermarkets look for ways to take advantage of stalls as an alternative to TV stands, microwave ovens and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s says it has doubled the size of its beauty products to 3,000 for the first time, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have additional space and branded areas similar to the in-store display style at Boots.
Supermarkets are also re-enhancing their Boutique makeup line so that the majority of products are plant-based – something increasingly sought after by younger customers.
Fragrance Shop will trial the sale at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to put more effort into attracting customers.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said stalls will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to counter offers from Aldi and Lidl with more non-food offerings and items.
Sainsbury’s, which has brought Argos stalls into hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitats stalls since they bought both brand chains two years ago, has boosted grocery sales and made acquisitions more lucrative.
The supermarket had previously tried to enhance its beauty and pharmaceutical businesses but failed.
Sainsbury's experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after problems with how to split sales from merchandise booths in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold 281 of its pharmaceuticals to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds, for <0xC2><0xA3>125m three years ago.
Reportedly Lloyds will play a part in the plan, by strengthening a range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty range to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specialized training for our employees, who will provide direct advice.
Our range of brands designed to suit every glamorous need and environment as well as convenient locations means we are now an attractive stopover that challenges the traditional way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'outraged' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was "outraged" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal in her style brand business to focus on her new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby didn’t have time for their Truly interiors and accessories brand.
The couple’s business is likened to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning took to Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den, infuriating star Peter Jones as she pulls out of their super-profitable style brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own lucrative new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
In a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, sources said Jones was "outraged" when the show's gold girl admitted that her new contracts - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m - meant she no longer had enough time to devote herself to their brand of furniture and accessories.
The business is likened to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11m fortune.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby took to Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left for one of her holiday homes.
A source said: "Really is a top priority for Holly.
That would be her long-term future that would probably accompany her for the next few decades.
Her decision to leave shocked the people involved.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, which was very close to the premiere.
There’s a warehouse full of cargo at Marlow’s headquarters that’s ready to roll out.”
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain’s most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions of dollars for investing heavily in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and interiors, and the ability to delay the launch.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin became close with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby formed Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple vacationed together and Jones had a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV’s I’m A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We're not going to comment on his business."
It’s hard to argue, and to love one another deeply.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from media outlets for making a comment that some would see as “not acting like a ruler” for being positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a parody of “the host.”
"I'm not giving up anything."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in the second meeting following their first meeting in Singapore in June when Trump hailed it as a major step toward denuclearization in North Korea.
But denuclearization talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not received a "satisfactory response" from the United States to North Korea's first disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing sanctions to increase pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view during his campaign speech.
“We’re doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We will go to war with North Korea.
Millions could be killed.
We are in a good relationship now.”
He said efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - ending missile tests, freeing hostages and returning the remains of U.S. service members to their home countries.
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this packed area, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs said they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has gone missing, no declaration of national disaster has been made, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very explicit in not asking for international aid, so it’s very challenging,” Sumbang said.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to move to Palu, they are not sure whether foreign staff can work in the area.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies were allowed to contribute aid efforts.
Despite the continuing earthquake situation that Indonesia has experienced, the country has not been well prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, such places were uncommon in other locations.
Despite the effective warning, the lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu is likely to lead to human casualties.
At its peak, moving between Indonesia’s many islands was a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
An ambulance train stayed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims making their way to Palu, but it would take at least three days to reach the site.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia’s aging infrastructure a centerpiece of his election campaign, and he has squandered his fortunes on building roads and railways.
But the financial shortfall has made it difficult for Joko’s administration as he faces re-election next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from unending sectarian tensions in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority pursue a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were washed away from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs scuffled the streets, using machetes, bows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Follow: Daniel Sturridge brings a draw for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London, with a goal in the 89th minute.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri 30 metres from Chelsea when his team was 1-0 down.
He handled the ball with his left foot before launching a shot into the far post.
Kick and head towards the top right corner of the goal.
The ball passed the reach of Kepa Arrizabalaga and flew straight into the net.
"Simply put, I'm in the right position, getting the ball and the players including Shaq are always trying to go up so I just have to go up," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming so I handled a touch and shot without much hesitation.”
Chelsea led nearly half of the match after the opening goal of Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
In this shot, the Royal Cavalry striker passed the ball to Mateo Kovacic before moving around the midfield and rushing up the Liverpool side of the pitch.
Kovacic had a bounce from the middle of the field.
He made a beautiful slot, heading for Hazard who was rushing up the penalty area.
Hazard eliminated the defence and shot with his left foot into the corner of goal, overtaking Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
The match between Liverpool and Napoli in the Champions League group stage will take place at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at UEFA Europa Leaguge at 3pm on Tuesday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami reached 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and frequency wave in Indonesia has risen to 832, the National Disaster Center announced early Sunday.
Many were reportedly trapped in the rubble of buildings brought by Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which brought waves as high as 20 feet, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the center, at a news conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, is engulfed in the rubble of buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of stabbing woman to death
After the discovery of a woman’s corpse was discovered this morning at Birkenhead, Merseyside, an investigation into the murder has been initiated.
The 44-year-old victim was found at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, with stab wounds, after which a 32-year-old male suspect was arrested.
Police are urging locals if they see or hear anything to come forward.
Detective Constable Brian O’Hagan said: “The new investigation is at an early stage but I would urge anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to let us know.
“I also urge anyone, especially drivers, who have inadvertently saved something from the angle of the journey to contact us as they can get important information for our investigation.”
A police statement identified the woman as a local resident of Birkenhead, and her body was found in the house.
This afternoon, several people were reported to have ties to the woman who had come to the scene to give testimony about where the victim had been in the morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police say they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews tried to return home, but police said no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out about it.
Residents were told it would take several hours until they were allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
An excited woman arrived at the scene.
She kept saying, “It’s horrible.
At 2 o'clock in addition to the police cars in the blockade, there was another car outside.
A large number of police officers were inside the blockaded area monitoring the apartment complex.
Anyone with information is asked to contact DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or call Crime Prevention anonymously on 0800 555 111 24/7 from September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell statue becomes the latest monument to suffer from 'rewriting history' story
Exclusion would be a trail of justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of the Puritan fanatics who followed him, as they destroyed countless structures and religions of Britain.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s words as “crazy” and an “effort to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It is inevitable that the debate over the removal of Oliver Cromwell’s statue outside the Palace of Westminster will become the focal point of debate today.
The symbol of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Cromwell may have been wrongly replaced by the actions of his father Thomas in the last century.
Cromwell’s representative, Sir William Hamo Thassycroft, is testimony to 19th-century opinion and is part of the history of a figure that many believe still deserves to be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Perhaps more in the late 19th century than it is now, Cromwell is seen by many as a protector of parliament against external pressure, in his mind of course the monarchy.
Whether it’s a perfectly accurate example of the topic in the continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our country and that Cromwell was a typical figure in the division.
His achievements as the Protector of God are also worthy of honor and recognition.”
Swine killer kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, local media reported.
The man, known as “Yuan”, was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood, near a market cage in Lu Banshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in a slaughterhouse on May 30, 2005 in Xiing, Qinghai Province, China.
He is said to have moved with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and saw a door of the pigsty next to it open.
He said in the cage was a large male pig with blood around its muzzle.
Reports of a forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked the farmer to death.
“My brother’s legs were covered in blood and not intact,” the cousin, known as “Wu”, told the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan arriving at the market around 4.40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
About an hour later, he was found dead.
The killer pig is not the pig in the two brothers’ pigs.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market's governing body are said to be negotiating compensation for his death.
Although uncommon, cases of pigs attacking people have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring their husband.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the smell of blood can act as a "bait."
“They just want to be close.
“They’re reserved, they’re curious ... they don’t want to hurt anyone.
You just have to treat them right,” he said.
Remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rain to the southwestern U.S.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it moves towards the colder currents off Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa has 85 mph winds, a Category 1 Typhoon Typhoon, as of 05:00 AM Eastern Time Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure began to form over the Pacific Ocean and moved eastward to the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approached the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm formed, it would begin to bring more of the north's humid temperatures into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, humid temperatures encountering low pressures that will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, rainfall of 1 to 4 inches will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and even the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Humidity temperatures will cause rainfall to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour at the sites, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is expected to reach 2 to 4 inches in southwestern areas, especially over large areas of Arizona.
Flash floods can occur when the situation deteriorates rapidly due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
The situation will be extremely difficult if you venture into the desert when there is a threat from tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause canyons to become violent rivers and thunderstorms will bring local gusts and dust vortexes.
Low pressure will bring some heavy rainfall locally many places on the Southern California coast.
The total rainfall can reach more than half an inch, easily causing debris flows and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain in the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains began to pour over Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before rain became more common late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will hit the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Some extreme temperatures can be seen across the United States in October when the Arctic is colder, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant changes in temperature in nearby localities.
A typical example of significant temperature differences in the central U.S. on Sunday.
The temperature difference is nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will be renewed and intensified.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to have a warm start in October with temperatures common in the mid-80s in the Southern Plains to the Northeast.
Temperatures in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Long-term weather forecasts are indicating a high probability that temperatures will be above average in the eastern U.S. throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's testimony
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's hearing on six television networks of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault alleged to have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with television stations interrupting regular broadcasts with last-minute sensationalism on Friday: a deal made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in the calm move, said he was 100 percent sure that it wasn’t happening.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched the hearing, Nielsen pointed out in its report on Friday.
The company calculated average viewership on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Figures are not immediately available for other broadcasters including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has a number of problems when it comes to calculating people’s views in the office.
In order to determine the correlation, the number of spectators was similar to that for a last-minute match or Oscar Award.
The Fox News channel, whose host strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all broadcasters with an average rating of 5.69 million viewers in its all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Concerns remain high after the hearing.
Flake is the central figure in Friday’s ruckus.
After the Republican moderate had just made a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on camera by CNN and CBS on Friday morning that he was being yelled at by protesters as he tried to travel by elevator to a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes during questioning, which was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing in front of you,” a woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the whole country?”
He was condemned to say, "You have power when so many women are helpless."
Flake said before the elevator closed that his office had issued a statement, saying he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and television stations covered hours of live coverage afterwards, when the Judiciary Committee would have to vote on whether Brett Kavanaugh was nominated.
But Flake said he would only do so knowing that the FBI would consider the allegations against the candidate next week, something some in minority Democrats have urged.
Flake was persuaded in part by conversations with his counterpart, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice carries weight, as it’s clear that Republicans won’t have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May dismisses 'political card' criticisms over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May dismissed criticism of her plans to leave the European Union as a "political trump card" for Britain's future and undermined her national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Meeting in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside her front-page interview, the former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, insisted on his response to their so-called Chequers deal on Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s tariffs was “absolutely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson over LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the scuffle.
Police discovered the glass from the scene and said they had detected Simpson's DNA on the glass, according to CBS' WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The Baton Rouge Regional Autopsy Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a bullet wound through the head to the neck.
The department is relying on Louisiana State Police, the anti-exfiltration task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police, and neighborhood residents to assist with the investigation into the arrest.
LSU physical director Joe Alleva thanked the regional legal authority for its “diligent work and pursuit of justice.”
Sims is only 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6-year-old forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points with 2.6 bats per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "stunned" by Wayde's death.
Mr Wade said: "That's what you have to be on the lookout for."
Volcano erupts in Mexico City
Ash spewing from the Popocatepetl volcano reached neighborhoods south of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it erupted, and they recorded 183 emissions and ash within 24 hours.
The center has been tracking multiple bouts of upheaval and shaking.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash clouding the car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence day
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, as thousands turned out on the occasion of the first anniversary of voting by both sides of Catalonia on secession.
A group of masked separatists was held back by riot police with eggs and powder-painted paint, causing dark clouds of dust in the streets that are often crowded with tourists.
The fighting broke out at the end of the day when police used batons to suppress the scuffle.
For hours, the pro-independence camp chanted "Don't forget, don't forgive" and confronted opposition protesters with the words "Great Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal with Madrid but welcomed by Catalan separatists.
Voters in the direction of independence dominated, although support was low with anti-separatists largely boycotting the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent the vote from taking place at polling stations in the region amid violent clashes.
Pro-independence camped out Friday night to prevent a rally in support of the national police.
The protest had taken place before, but had to take place in a different way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the secessionist protest with his wife, said he had no hope about Catalonia's prospects for independence.
“Last year we had the best of times.
I watched my parents cry because they were happy to be able to vote but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite a narrowly significant victory in a regional election last December, Catalan pro-independence factions have struggled to retain momentum this year with many of their most prominent leaders either sidelined or detained pending trial for their role in organising the subsequent independence referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who turned on the pro-police protest with her phone, said the conflict had been quashed by politicians on both sides.
"The story is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison before trial since the end of last year, announced he would run in next year’s European Parliament elections.
“Joining as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the backwardness of democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after smashing car into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the car pulled up to a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Police investigating Bob Blemmings said the incident caused damage to the gates and the building itself.

Menga's shot gave Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's lead gives Livingston a win
Livingston came up to surprise Rangers when the Ibrox home team was led by Steven Gerrard with just two defeats in 18 games.
Dolly Menga’s goal proved the difference when Gary Holt’s side lifted the Hibernian in just a few seconds.
Gerrard’s side have yet to score a bye in the Premier League this season and face the hosts Hearts, who lead by eight points, next Sunday.
Rangers host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has extended his unbeaten run in six games, with Holt having suffered defeats since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed the opportunity to play against the visitors.
Holt's side should have been ahead before they scored, with their direct tactics making Rangers difficult.
Scott Robinson struggled but passed the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only direct his efforts stronger after leading the ball to Craig Halkett on the goal.
The home team are confident of letting Rangers play in front of them, knowing they can trouble the visitors with individual techniques.
And that's the strategy for the set shot.
Rangers gave a free-kick and Livingston took the lead, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up for Menga, who had the touchdown and scored right in the middle of the goal.
At this time, Rangers had the advantage of keeping the ball but found the defense impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly almost no difficulty,
The match continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos received help from Kelly.
Scott Pittman lost at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow moved to another Livingston play scenario.
Passes kept coming into Livingston's goal and were repeatedly caught, with two penalties - after Halkett's challenge to substitute Glenn Middleton, one for the touch of the ball - being thwarted.
'Labeling' with Livingston - analysis
from BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
An eye-opening result and match for Livingston.
The team is excellent, continues to reach far beyond expectations in the comeback.
Their style of play and players have rarely changed since they returned to the top, but the considerable credit must go to Holt for the way he has honed the team since his arrival.
You have too many strong players.
Captain Halkett is the overarching one, arranging a superbly organized defense, while Menga constantly keeps Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As in Gerrard’s time, they didn’t meet those standards.
The missed final shot – the only chance to open the home field – and it was a wake-up call for Rangers, who landed in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and favourable weather on Saturday (Sept. 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the final day of Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to mend ties between NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne for the inauguration of a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent crowds of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters were also nearby to meet their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurds – have also come forward, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
The bi-polar protests reflect the divergence of a guest who was hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and reviled by others as an autocrat.
Deptford accident: cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist has been killed in a car crash in London.
The accident happened near the junction of Bestwood and Evelyn streets, a busy neighborhood in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The crash came months after another cyclist was killed in a crash and fled on Childers Road, about a mile from Saturday's crash.
Police said they were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads were blocked and buses were diverted, and participants were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
Six staff members were injured in a riot in a high-security male prison, the prison officer said.
Riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday morning and are still ongoing.
"Tornado" specialists were brought in to deal with the melee, which ended at about 17:30.
Officers were examined at the scene with minor injuries.
A prison management spokesperson said: “Special training prison staff have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six injured officers were treated.
"We have no tolerance for violence in our prisons and it is clear that those individuals involved will be transferred to the police and can spend more time behind bars."
HM Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 inmates, including some of the nation’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the Prison Superintendent had been treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, riot officers were called to prison to deal with a serious riot in which officers were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Flash Flooding (Floods That Can Benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen as early as next week as the energy trails of Hurricane Rosa across the Southwest desert remain, bringing flash flood risks.
The National Weather Service released flash flood tracking Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa was expected to travel in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, but earlier on Monday night there was thunderstorms.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix mentioned in a brief report that only "ten tropical cyclones have formed tropical cyclones or tropical depressions within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest forecast models from the latest National Hurricane Center predict rainfall as high as 2 to 4 inches, with separate flooding levels of up to 6 inches at the Mogollon Belt in Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to be 1 to 2 inches submerged, with separate levels of flooding up to 4 inches.
For areas that don’t experience sudden flooding, the rain from Rosa could be a good omen because the region is in drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some waterfalls can still be gladly welcomed because the Southeast is suffering from drought conditions.
The U.S. Drought Watchdog reports that just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the lowest level of extreme drought, but still the second-highest in the same category.
First, the passageway of Hurricane Rosa left behind landslides across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa was still at maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm hit cooler currents in the Pacific and weakened.
As a result, forecasts suggest there will be landslides in Mexico when the tropical depression passes on Monday evening.
The amount of rain falling on parts of Mexico can be significant, signaling the possibility of flooding.
According to Weather.com, "The total estimated rainfall from Baja California to northwest Sonora, could be as much as 10 inches."
Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday in the form of a tropical depression, which will then sweep through Arizona and make landfall in southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
"The main hazard forecast from Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, Northwest Sonora and the southwestern U.S. desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause flash floods and life-threatening spills in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
The Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Suspects of Intentional Murder Have Been Arrested
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 4am BST on Saturday morning.
He was taken to the hospital in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon and Somerset, police said.
Officers have urged anyone who holds any video footage related to the incident to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'endures the selfishness, anger' of Democrats
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the cruel and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the selfishness, the anger" of Democrats throughout his candidacy.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and categorically denying an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades before they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegations.
The president said Saturday that "the American people have witnessed Kavanaugh's excellence and qualities and courage" that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm that one of the most brilliant legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a genuine public record,” he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President mentioned the details of Brett Kavanaugh’s candidacy when talking about the importance of voting for Republicans in the midterm elections.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm running." He said.
“That’s why I’m going around fighting for the right candidates.”
Trump said Democrats wanted to “limit and obstruct.”
The first core procedural vote on the Senate floor of Kavanaugh’s candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake, tsunami, damage rises
At least 384 people have been killed, many washed away as huge waves pounded beaches, as a massive earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday as waves up to six metres (18 feet) high slammed ashore at dusk, sweeping people dead and wreaking havoc on everything in its path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still taking part in their activities on the beach and did not leave immediately and they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Prevention Agency (BNPB) said in a statement in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come on its own, it dragged cars, timber, houses, swept through everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed through the open sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before making landfall on the coast.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges crumbling and collapsing and a mosque submerged in water.
Aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
A chain of earthquakes has been noticed in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Bureau of Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in its statement that the energy released by Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s location, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have enhanced the size of the tsunami, according to the publication.
Nugroho described the damage as "tremendous" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage may not have stopped along the coast 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palu, an area known as Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the quake.
The media was “totally paralyzed with no news at all” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were visiting the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but the tragedy can be much more horrifying,” they said.
The agency on Saturday was widely condemned for not announcing that the tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the warning was given.
In a non-professional video posted on social media, a man can be heard screaming to people down the road about the approaching tsunami.
Minutes later, a wall of water came ashore, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that ruptured communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the army had begun cutting off cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees were still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city airport has been reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Death toll in Indonesia tsunami rises to more than 800
The situation is very bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the employees were staying in tents set up in the office courtyard, they passed through scenes of destruction on the road, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even as aid groups began making significant moves at the start of disaster relief tools, some complained that foreign aid workers with high expertise were prevented from moving to Palu.
Under Indonesian rules, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government decides, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ then we can be ready with international support but no word yet.”
As Monday night descended on Palu following Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of those still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be the magic that piece together the somber stories of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled from the drain.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman trapped under rubble for two days with the body of her mother beside her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia’s national paraglider team coach, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“As a paragliding veteran, I carry my own emotional burden,” he says.
Gendon said that in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread in the paragliding community, he desperately texted rivals in Palu who were attending the beach festival.
However, his message indicated only one gray area instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages have not been sent,” he said.
The robbers took away $26,750 when the ATM was loaded at Newport in Levee.
According to reports from the Newport Police Department, the robbers took $26,750 from a Brink’s banker while they were depositing money at an ATM in Newport, Levee.
The driver of the car had cleared the ATM in the entertainment district and was about to hand over more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy reported in the article.
While he was busy, a man “came from behind the Brink employee” and took the money that had to be delivered.
According to reports, witnesses saw several suspects hovering around the scene, but the number of people involved has not yet been determined.
Anyone with information on the identity of the suspect is asked to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
In a tweet on Saturday, he said: “People used to know me as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been working under the stage name Ye for a while and used the name as the name of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He was the show's guest on behalf of singer Ariana Grande when she reported her "emotional disorder," the show's creator said.
As well as the abbreviation in his current stage name, West had previously said the word had religious connotations for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible the word means 'friend,'" West said earlier this year, while chatting about the title of his album with broadcaster Big Boy.
"So I'm friends, I'm us, it's us.
The transition goes from Kanye, which means unique, to Ye — a reflection of the good, the bad, the anxious, everything.
The album is more than a reflection of ourselves.
He is one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is widely known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he said he was aiming for Love and Brother Love.
An artist who had collaborated with West, JAY-Z, was also wondering whether or not there were hyphens and capital letters.
Mexican President Says He Will Not Send Troops Against Civilians
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of its bloody revenge against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "never commit troops to oppress the Mexican people."
The army opened fire during a peace demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support Mexican youth by offering monthly grants to learners and opening more free public universities.
He said the issue of unemployment and lack of educational opportunities have led young people to engage in evils.
The U.S. should double its A.I. aid.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in the field, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even while the overall U.S. is lacking a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a positive start, as all other countries lag far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chance that the next huge AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book “Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order,” published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked at an AI system that beat the highest-ranked U.S. player Othello, followed by an executive at Microsoft Research and a director of Google’s China division.
Lee approaches previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Advanced Projects Research Agency’s Robotics Challenge and is concerned about when the next competition will take place, in order to help define the next vision.
Researchers in the United States often go to great lengths to obtain government aid, Lee said.
“It’s not China that is calling all the scholars to the forefront; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired bright stars from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. bolster its AI efforts.
He added: “I think the green card should be automatically granted to PhDs in AI.”
China’s State Council issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee added: “China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides aid to those belonging to academic institutions in much the same way that the Foundation and other government organizations provide funding to U.S. researchers, but the quality of research in China is lower.
Earlier this year in the United States, the Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at interdicting partners from industry and education, and the White House announced the creation of the Artificial Intelligence Select Committee.
This month the Agency for the Direction of Advanced Defense Research Projects announced a $2 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
At the National Science Foundation, they now invest more than $100 million a year in AI research.
U.S. law has sought to establish a National Security Council on Artificial Intelligence but has not seen a move in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country’s name
Macedonians voted in Sunday's referendum on whether to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia," a move to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece aimed at preventing EU and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbor corresponds to its own territory and has vetoed joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but opponents of nationalism argued that the change would undermine the national identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts about whether voters would meet the minimum 50 percent requirement for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum ballot reads: “Do you agree to become a member of NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price to pay to pursue membership in organizations such as the EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje said. "Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia so that they can freely enjoy the patronage of the European Union because it moves towards safer lives for all of us."
While members of parliament are not legally bound, they have said they will adhere to the results of the vote to make a decision.
A name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Commission said there were no reports of anomalies until 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in last year’s parliamentary election when 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
Gjose Tanevski, 62, of Skopje, said: “I go to vote for my children, because our position is in Europe.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Macedonia's referendum on changing the country's name, which will pave the way for accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small platform and pulling chairs in front of tents set up by people who would boycott the referendum.
Kavadarkov said: “We support NATO and the EU, but we want to participate in the main way, not through the back door.”
“We are a poor nation, but poor and clean.
“If they don’t see us as Macedonia, then we can move on to other countries like China and Russia and become part of Eurasia.”
Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the majority will agree because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said a "yes" result would be "an affirmation for our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonia Institute for Policy Studies said between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum - well below the required vote.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, said 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they put forward a yes vote.
A successful referendum must have a 50 percent vote rate and one vote.
The failure of the referendum represents the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western administration since it took place in May last year.
Sergio Aguero at Manchester City has penetrated the entire Brighton defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling smashed Brighton's defence with Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero showed his class with a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker receives a pass from the middle of the field when he starts to take the ball.
He ran ahead of three Brighton defenders before breaking into the empty field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four blue shirt players.
He chases a defender before stopping other opponents at the edge of the Brighton goal.
Pass to the left, lead the ball immediately to Sterling.
The England international led his first touch in the penalty area to Aguero, who kicked his right shoe with a shot to knock out Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan from the right side of the net.
Pep Guardiola told reporters: “Aguero has some leg injuries.
"We're talking about just letting him play for 55, 60 minutes.
It happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that time.”
But it is Sterling who gives the first advantage to the blue shirt players in the struggle in the Premier League.”
Recorded in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the lead deep inside Brighton’s wing during the match.
He took an extreme ball to the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane with a few leading shots before leading Sterling to the title.
The Blues striker put the ball into the net just before the ball slipped out of control.
The Champions League match between City and Hoffenheim took place at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to fight the Rockies.
With the Nationals knocked out of the final round, there wasn’t much reason to start over.
But a belligerent Scherzer hopes to win Sunday’s field game against the Colorado Rockies, but this only makes sense when it comes to the Rockies, the team leading a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies won at least one spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to retain the top spot.
“Even though it was pointless to play, at least we got to throw the ball when we learned about the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other teams that were going to play in whatever top form I was able to play this year.
Why wouldn't I want to fight in a match like that?
The Nationals have not yet announced the opening player in Sunday’s game, but it looks like Scherzer will be on the ball in this situation.
Scherzer, who is tossing his 34th starter, will have his pitching practice on Thursday and play on his Sunday break.
Washington's right-hand man has an 18-7 record with 2.53 ERA (Mean Value of Running) and 300 attacks in 220 2/3 games this season.
Trump's Campaign in West Virginia
The president touched upon the details of the situation around his Supreme Court, picking Brett Kavanaugh when talking about the importance of voting Republican in the midterm elections.
“Everything we do has potential in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big things — not running, but running is why I go around fighting for the right candidates.”
Trump continued: “You’re going to see the negative, negative, extreme Democrat Party that’s out there right now.
And they are determined to suppress power by using any means, and then you will see selfishness, trickery.
They don’t care who gets hurt, they don’t care who steps up to gain power and control, they just want to gain power and control, and we’re not going to give them that.”
He added, “Democrats are looking to ‘restrict and obstruct.’
"You've seen that in the last four days," he added, calling the Democrats "angry and selfish and manipulative and fake."
He pointed to the Senate Judiciary Committee’s finding that Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, which was booed from below.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you expose the information?
What?
No, no, no, I expected it to be -- it was not the best body language -- it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer an open party.
Giving an opinion is unacceptable.
I was not surprised when Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
After all, I’m the latest in a long line of Labour MPs to be told I’m not welcome – for having expressed an opinion.
Joan Ryan, a member of Congress with me, received the same treatment because she was a staunch supporter of dissent.
In my case, the censorship was directed at me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a great economic policy, on national security, in Europe, the same ironic issues that Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
During his nearly eight years as a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, the leadership meetings on Friday night were all held in such a fashion.
Sadly, today, it’s not the tone in many meetings and the “kinder, gentler” political promise that was long forgotten and indeed whether that ever began.
It became increasingly clear that different views were not tolerated within the Labour Party and that all opinions were judged on whether the party leaders accepted them or not.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as my former colleagues I thought were politically aligned with me began to expect me to switch my mind and take positions I would never approve of – whether on national security or EU markets only.
Whenever I speak publicly — and indeed whatever I say — there is an abuse on social media that calls for removal, a central political denunciation, telling me that I should not join the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
Indeed, I know I’m luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face the flow of sexist or racist abuse every day but never shy away from it.
One of the saddest aspects of this political age is that the level of abuse has become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Labour Party should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that open party and with every move of “not confident” or change in the rules of choice, the party has become narrow.
I’ve had a lot of advice over the last two years about pushing me to stay calm, not too many words, and then I’ll be “okay.”
But I’m not involved in politics because of that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a young boy, I’ve been driven by the neglect of Thatcher’s government, which has literally brought down my all-inclusive school, I’ve sought to bring better public services to those who need them most – whether local commissioners or government ministers.
I have never hidden my political views, not even from the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be misled about my policy positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who pushed for the move on Friday, all I want to share is when the country sinks in on Brexit, which will hurt our households, businesses and public services, I have no desire at all to waste my time and energy on loyalty to the Leader of the Labour Party.
But really, a message outside of Nottingham Momentum that I stand for, to my constituents, Labour or not: I am proud to serve and I promise that there will be no threat of removal or political means preventing me from acting on what I believe will be of the greatest benefit to you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Ayr undefeated lead
The following two attempts may have skewed the final result, but there’s no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this glamorous Tennent Premiership match of the day.
Now they are at the top of the table, the only undisputed king in the ten teams.
After all, it’s their defense, as well as as many better opportunities for them, with the home team and coach Peter Murchie fully entitled to be satisfied.
He said: "So far, we've gone through our games and we're still unbeaten, so I'm satisfied."
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Give in to Ayr, they seize the opportunities better than us.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute score, which was added by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but, a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, opened the game for the Warriors, allowing Melrose to show his skill and Jason Baggot to make a tackle.
Climo took the lead over Ayr with a penalty, before, right in the first half, he scored then scored more points with a solo shot raising the score to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson scored, Baggot added points, shortening the score to five points.
After a long period of serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was lagging, and since restarting, Ayr took the lead thanks to Stafford McDowall's goal, Climo scored more points.
Acting Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was then shown a yellow card, and once again, Melrose cost the side the player with a no-score shot from Bruce Colvine, facing a tense pressure.
However, the home team was back, and when Struan Hutchinson was shown a yellow card for facing Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson scored on the Ayr team's support advantage.
Climo added points, as he had done almost since his re-emergence, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's toss and passed to winger Gregor Henry after the home team's fifth point.
The star of the movie Still Game is about to enter the restaurant business.
Still Game star Ford Kieran is set to move into the hospitality industry after learning he is considered a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star played Jack Jarvis in the BBC drama, which he wrote and co-starred with Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the ninth season of the series would be the last on the radio, and it looked like Kiernan was planning Craiglang’s next life.
According to the official list listed, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor was not immediately available for comment, but a Scottish Sun source said Kiernan was looking forward to getting into Glasgow’s “prosperous restaurant business”.
‘The coast is ours’: landlocked country Bolivia hopes court will reopen access to Pacific
Sailors patrol an equipped naval headquarters in La Paz.
All public buildings have a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon were painted with the slogan: “The sea is our right.
The return of the sea is our mission.”
In every nook and cranny of Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in the bloody resource conflict of the 19th century is still vivid — as is the yearning to sail out to the Pacific once more.
Those hopes are perhaps the most burning in decades, as Bolivia awaits the ruling of the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat, said: “Bolivia is motivated, united and calm, and of course expects a positive outlook on the outcome.”
Many Bolivians will be watching the ICJ ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will back up Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of tense exchanges – Chile is obliged to negotiate giving Bolivia a sovereign sea passage.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s convincing original president, who faces a fierce debate for re-election next year, also played many cards in Monday’s ruling.
At the end of August, he insisted: “We are about to return to the Pacific Ocean.”
But some analysts say the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia — and that is unlikely to change.
The UN, based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to hand over territory to Chile and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of potential exchanges.
The ICJ ruling came just six months after final debates showed the situation was “not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, an expert on Chilean international law.
And beyond Bolivia’s litigation, the last four years could be reversed.
Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said: "The issue of access to the sea has been attacked by the current Bolivian authorities."
She added that Mr Morales’ bellicose statements had snuffed out any remaining Chilean goodwill.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate with each other, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9>, Bolivia’s representative to The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court’s decision was unusually quick.
Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to end 139 years of mutual interests, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America — was using the maritime issue as a political lifeline.
Bolivia added: “Bolivia will never give up its right to access to the Pacific.”
“Judgement is an opportunity to see that we need to move past that.”
North Korea says it will never have nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has revealed that his country will never denuclearize unless it can be trusted by Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two sides.
He made the remarks as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be on the verge of relaunching nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an "illusory dream" to continue U.S. sanctions and opposition to declaring an end to the Korean War to subjugate North Korea.
Washington is cautiously agreeing to the statement without Pyongyang making notable disarmament moves first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are looking forward to a second summit.
But there is considerable scepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal it sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month in preparation for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion launches its latest line of wide-brimmed hats that are about to cover all the major streets near you
If you want to loosen up your hat collection or completely stay out of the sun, you don’t have to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled an unusual range of oversized head designs in their SS19 collection on the runway that will dazzle the design style at Paris Fashion Week.
Non-applicable hats swept Instagram this summer, and the designers brought their eye-catching creations to the runway.
Valentino’s signature item is a beige hat over the top of the wide-brimmed head attached with feather-like accessories, overlaid on the model’s head.
Other oversized accessories include fussy watermelons, witch hats, and even a pineapple — but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks are stitched lips in a style more similar to Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One looks like a scuba diving device complete with snorkels and goggles, while the other looks like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you keep going in the giant fashion direction – then you’re in luck.
Speculators predict that large-sized cheetah hats may be about to pop up all over the big streets near you.
Big hats became hot on the heels of ‘La Bomba’, a wide-brimmed hat a few inches wide used by Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fanfare brand behind the extremely unrealistic hat that has been splashed across social media has brought another major creative twist to the runway – a beach bag nearly as big as a bathing suit.
The burnt orange raffia bag, laced with raffia yarn with a white leather handle, is a highlight of Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Prominent stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see full-sized beach hats and bags flooding major streets next summer – as the designer has made such an impact that it’s hard to ignore the need for large-sized accessories.”
John Edwards: Foreign language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland’s private schools have maintained their academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with a string of commendable academic results, reinforced both individually and collectively by sport, art, music and community engagement.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, sponsored by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), are dedicated to providing the best quality of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to acquire a broad and deep knowledge, as well as the career orientation and status of their students as global citizens.
As an educational sub-discipline that can design and run the school’s unique curriculum, we see modern foreign languages continuing to be a popular topic of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to someone in the language he understands, his words will enter his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words that come out will go into his heart.”
This is a compelling message that we don’t just rely on English when it comes to establishing relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent exams this year, we can see that foreign languages are leading in the rankings with the best scores in private schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language students scored higher than A.
Data collected from SCIS’ 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students who scored above A in Chinese, besides 72 percent who studied German, 69 percent who studied French and 63 percent who studied Spanish also scored A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are moving towards seeing foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will not be without in the future.
Elective foreign language subjects are being considered as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) majors in private school curricula as well as elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Skills and Careers Council in 2014 showed that among the reasons employers have difficulty finding people, there is a shortage of foreign language skills.
Therefore, foreign language skills are becoming more practical to equip young people to enter the career in the future.
With more career prospects needing foreign languages, these skills become practical in an increasingly flat world.
No matter how people choose to work, if they learn a second language, they will gain a real advantage in the future when they have such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly in the native language of the people themselves, a polyglot will obviously lead the test.
According to a YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to practice a simple assembly passage in another foreign language, and only French was the only foreign language to account for a single number, 15 percent.
This is why investing in foreign language teaching is so important for children today.
Being multilingual, especially in the languages of developing economies, equips children with a brighter potential for finding a real job.
In Scotland, each school teaches different foreign languages.
Some schools will focus on more modern foreign languages, while others will teach those that are considered important to the UK in view of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever their interests, there are a variety of foreign languages to choose from within private schools, along with a team of professional teachers.
Scottish private schools focus on providing an academic environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need for success, no matter what the future holds.
It is undeniable that, in an international business environment, foreign languages will continue to be a very important factor for the future of the country, which should be replicated in education.
In fact, modern foreign languages should be considered “international communication skills.”
Private schools will continue to offer this opportunity to young Scots: diversity and excellence.
There's no other choice.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council for Private Schools.
LeBron in the opening game at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is coming to an end for fans eager to see LeBron James play head to head for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
How long you will be in the game is not known.
Walton told the Lakers' official website: "It's going to be about 48 minutes."
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell shared that there is a possibility that James will join the match for a limited time.
Watching the week’s workouts, James was asked about plans for a pre-season six-game schedule at the Lakers.
He said: “I don’t need to play a few pre-season games at this stage of my career.
Trump campaign in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight, in Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump begins his campaign.
This is the first stop on President Trump’s five-campaign journey next week, including stops in supporter states like Tennessee and Mississippi.
The confirmation vote for his nominee for the vacant Supreme Court seat is on hold, with President Trump trying to win support ahead of the upcoming midterm elections, with Republicans at risk of losing control of Congress when the vote begins in November.
Trump’s campaign in West Virginia begins at what time tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, Sept. 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s campaign in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Trump will likely refer to this week’s hearing of Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is now facing sexual assault charges and the Senate confirmation vote delayed by a week for the FBI to conduct its investigation.
However, the main purpose of these mass rallies is to gain support for Republican candidates before the November election.
According to Reuters, the goal of the campaign, through five campaigns next week, is to “reinforce volunteers and Republican supporters in the race to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
“Control of Congress is an important issue on the agenda, so the president will visit as many states as possible before the busy election season,” a Trump campaign spokesman said.
Scheduled to take place at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena, tonight's rally could draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, while also drawing Pittsburgh media coverage," West Virginia Radio Metro News said.
Saturday will be President Trump’s second visit in the past month to West Virginia, a state he won by 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to support Patrick Morrisey, the Republican nominee for West Virginia State Senator, as he is currently behind in the polls.
Simon Haeder, a political science researcher at West Virginia University, said: “The fact that the president has to visit the state to gain support in voting for the candidate is not a good sign for Morrisey.”
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows determination to fight to keep trophy in singles matches on Sunday
After three uneventful matches, a doubles match on Saturday afternoon could be essential for the Ryder Cup.
The pendulum-style wrist swing to create momentum is a completely new sporting concept, but also one that athletes really believe in, especially in games like this.
So where is the momentum now?
"They were six points ahead, flying down to four, and I think that was the motivation for us," Spieth said as he walked away.
Of course, the European team has the advantage, leading by four points, and they have 12 more matches to play.
As Spieth said, the U.S. team still has some hope and they are encouraged a lot, especially with the pairing of Spieth and Justin Thomas. These two players have competed many times and each has won three points.
Spieth is a veteran player in passing the ball from the teeing position to the hole and he always leads by example.
The shouts of joy grew louder as he reached his round, especially the dribble to equalize the match as he and Thomas took turns hitting the ball into the hole.
The 15th match-winning dribble was similar, meaning he had full faith in the U.S. team’s comeback.
Spieth said: “You have to think hard and worry about your own game.
All the athletes are gone.
There are 18 holes left to score.
For the past two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an undeniable Ryder Cup legend, have been the only couple to score more points than Spieth and Thomas.
This odd but respectable pair of the European team has ever won 4:0 and can not make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that did not play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the following nine holes on Friday morning.
That victory and the energy from them spread to the crowd of cheering fans giving people the feeling that the two of them are the opponents to beat on Sunday; and there is no golfer more worthy than Fleetwood or Molinari to defend the European team’s victory at sundown on Le Golf National.
Hopefully both of you will appear at the same time on different golf holes.
However, it is still too early to confirm the European team’s victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourball series in the morning, in a match against Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes left the Spanish and Swedish players completely lost the chance to counterattack.
On Sunday, I'm afraid no one will pull them out of that defeat.
Fourball and foursome matches are always the best to watch because of the interaction between the duos, their advice and observing the changing play strategy in a split second.
The European team played better and were far ahead before the final day, but this series of foursomes showed that Team USA still had a chance to win.
The European team leads 10-6 before the start of the final day of the Ryder Cup
The European team will take advantage before the final day of the Ryder Cup after a spectacular fourball and foursome series, leading the US team 10-6.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led this advantage by winning two games against Tiger Woods to win an additional 4 points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn of Europe, determined to regain the trophy lost to his friend Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the U.S. side in the morning fourball, leading 3-1.
The U.S. team performed better in the foursome series, winning two games, but failed to win the final.
Jim Furyk’s team needed eight points in Sunday’s singles series to win back the cup.
Fleetwood was the first European player to win four consecutive points when he and Molinari, often referred to as the "Molliwood" pair, were the second pair after the dramatic weekend to have won four points in their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a fourball match, they had an even more convincing victory over Woods and US rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a score of 5&4.
Woods played two games on Saturday and sometimes had flashbacks, but so far, he has lost 19 of his 29 games in the fourball and foursome series, including seven in a row.
Justin Rose, after a break in the morning fourball series came back with Henrik Stenson in the foursome, beating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked 1st and 3rd in the world, with scores of 2&1.
However, despite the pleasant southwest Paris weather, the European team did not have an easy day.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a milestone for the U.S. team with two points on Saturday.
They won a convincing 2&1 victory over Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourball, and then went on to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome, despite missing the first two holes.
In Ryder Cup history, only twice a team that is four points behind can start singles matches, though, Furyk's team only needs to draw to keep the cup.
After only being considered as the second-placed man in two days, Sunday will most likely become a comeback for this team.
North Korea says there's 'no way' to disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that sanctions remain in place to deepen its distrust of the United States and that under these circumstances there is no way it will unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho, speaking during the annual session of the UN General Assembly, said North Korea had taken "multiple goodwill measures" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and pledging to not proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we do not see the same move from the U.S. side,” he said.
“If we cannot trust the U.S. side, then we will not be able to ensure our national security with confidence, and under such circumstances, there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Although Ri repeated North Korea’s familiar complaint that Washington refuses to disarm in “phases” and that North Korea would receive corresponding benefits from doing so step by step, his remarks have the remarkable point of not rejecting unilateral nuclear disarmament as Pyongyang has refused before.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12. In the statement, Kim pledged efforts toward “denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump promised to ensure North Korea’s security.
North Korea is still trying to find a way to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States insists that Pyongyang give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease draconian international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases pressure with sanctions to achieve its goals in a coercive manner, even opposing the "declaration of an end to the war", Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is just a wild dream of those who know nothing about us.
“But the problem is that the sanctions that are still in place continue to lose our trust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. leader presented at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he mentioned three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: “If the negotiating party on nuclear disarmament is South Korea, not the United States, then the denuclearization talks on the Korean Peninsula will not be at an impasse as they are today.”
But Ri’s tone was different from last year’s, when he told the General Assembly that North Korea’s launch of missiles at the U.S. mainland was inevitable on a suicide mission after Trump called Kim “rocket man.”
Last year at the United Nations, Trump threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, but this year he lavished praise on Kim for taking courageous steps to disarm, but he also stressed that much work remains to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not set a deadline for this: “Two years, three years or just five months doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its efforts.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “Security Council sanctions must continue to be vigorously and uncompromisingly enforced until we can confirm the results of complete denuclearization, finally, with verifiable evidence.”
The Security Council has agreed to strengthen sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to stem funding for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo held talks with Ri on the sidelines of official U.N. General Assembly meetings and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the final result has not been very positive.
He left Pyongyang after a visit in July and said there had been progress in the talks, but just hours later North Korea accused the foreign minister of making "gangster-like demands."
North Korea has pledged to take part in a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-In this month aimed at dismantling a missile test base and a nuclear complex if the United States makes the same move.
He said Kim directed that the "similar move" he was seeking was the security assurance Trump had pledged during talks in Singapore and to move toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough rest
In an effort to combat a culture of machine learning pressure, with night owl students drinking coffee instead of water, a new course at Harvard University this year has encouraged all college students to get more sleep.
Students who study at the world’s number one university often don’t know the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, is also a specialist at Women’s Hospital and Brigham designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
The inspiration for starting this course came after he participated in a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on the learning process.
“At the end of our conversation, a female student came up to me and said, ‘Why did you learn this in your final year?’
She said no one told her about the importance of sleep, which really surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explains to students how the importance of good sleep habits enhances academic and athletic performance, while improving their overall health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the school decided to introduce the course after discovering students were severely sleep-deprived during the week.
The one-hour course includes a wide range of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a dorm room image, in which students can click on coffee mugs, curtains, workout machines, and books to learn about how caffeine, light, and sleep deprivation affect sports performance, as well as the importance of forming a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants were asked how long-term sleep deprivation could increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, the university campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this course cannot immediately change students’ behavior.
But we believe they have a right to know — just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke,” Czeisler added.
He said: “The proud culture of ‘night owl students’ still exists, at the same time that modern technologies and increasing pressure on students lead to sleep deprivation is an increasingly serious problem.
Ensuring adequate, quality sleep should become a student’s ‘secret weapon’ against stress, exhaustion and anxiety – even to avoid weight gain, because a lack of sleep puts the brain into a state of hunger, which leads to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying biology, chemistry and physics, helped Czeisler design the course and took one of last year’s classes during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course helped him “open his eyes” and inspired him to make an effort to call for a school-wide course.
He hoped that the next step would be to suggest that all graduate students take a similar degree program before starting to compete in the main course.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider setting bedtime, wake-up time alarms, and be aware of the harmful effects of ‘blue light’ emitted from electronic screens and LEDs, which can disturb your circadian rhythm, leading to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga takes down Gerrard's boys
Rangers had an unsuccessful day when Dolly Menga's counterattack caused Steven Gerrard's team to lose 1-0 to Livingston.
The Ibrox side were hoping to mark their first win since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side inflicted Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as head coach, stretching an eight-point lead over league leaders Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga maintained the attack seven minutes before the end of the first half, but the Rangers' mood seemed to have never been crushed.
Rangers have now fallen to sixth place, while Livingston has climbed to third place, trailing only Hibernian on goal difference.
And Rangers had to deal with another problem after referee Calum Spence had to treat a head injury after an obvious object was thrown from the away end.
Gerrard changed the line-up eight times from the squad that overcame Ayr to reach the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt kept the same Livi 11 that drew and won a point against the Hearts team last week and he must have been extremely happy with the way his students besieged opponents in each attack.
Although the Rangers held the ball more, Livingston was the team that really posed a danger when it came to the ball.
They should have scored just two minutes after Menga first sent Scott Pittman into the field, attacking Allan McGregor’s goal but the midfielder missed this opportunity.
A deep shot from Keaghan Jacobs took the ball to captain Craig Halkett’s foot, but defender Alan Lithgow could only take the ball to the post behind the goal.
Rangers had control of the ball on the pitch, but their play was largely based on hope rather than belief, especially in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos was certain that he should have received a penalty on the penalty spot because he and Steven Lawless had been involved in a collision but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers only had two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's counterattack.
Although Livi’s opening goal in the 34th minute was supposed to be an advantage, no one could deny that their victory was absolutely deserved.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to handle Jacobs’s deep-bounds throw.
Scott Arfield could not react when Declan Gallagher made the ball for Scott Robinson, and Scott calmly chose Menga to make a simple shot.
Gerrard immediately had an option during the break, by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and this substitution almost immediately had an impact when the winger poked Morelos but Kelly impressed by immediately blocking the direction of the ball.
But Livingston succeeded in getting the visitors to play the game they wanted, as Lithgow and Halkett kept rolling out long passes.
Holt’s side had a chance to take the lead in the final minutes of the match, but unfortunately McGregor picked the right spot to stop Jacobs before Lithgow headed wide from the corner.
Rangers freshman Glenn Middleton continued to complain of a penalty request after a collision with Jacobs, but was again dismissed by Thomson.
Yearbook: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
Take a page from the "Sunday Morning" Yearbook: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and CONTINUELY...future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, inventing the foundation for the device known as the Geiger Counter.
Since then, the Geiger Counter has not only become a pillar of science, but also a pillar of popular culture. The following example is a dialogue in the film "Bells of Coronado", released in 1950, starring the scientist and cowboy king Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: “This is the Geiger Counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radiation in the mineral.”
Evans: “Yes, there’s a clicking sound coming from here!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name remains forever.
New cancer vaccine could teach immune system how to ‘watch’ damaged cells
New cancer vaccine could teach immune system how to ‘watch’ damaged cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system how to recognize damaged cells during treatment
This includes taking immune cells from the patient, changing cells in the lab.
These cells can then ‘see’ proteins that are common in many cancers and are re-injected into the body.
An experimental vaccine is showing positive results in patients with different cancers.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught her immune system to recognize broken cells and her ovarian cancer cells disappeared after more than 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient, changing them in the lab, so that these cells can "see" the protein common in many cancers, called HER2, which is then re-injected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the development of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of research, taking immune cells from a patient’s body and “teaching” them how to target and kill cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye gets a lot of "bricks" when showing crazy support to President Trump, Make America Great Again (MAGA hat) after Saturday Live Concert (SNL)
Things aren't going well.
Kanye West received many boos in the studio during the SNL Concert, after his rambling performance. During the performance, he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and confirmed he will run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song, Ghost Town, still wearing the Make America Great Again hat, he angrily expressed his opposition to the Democrats and affirmed his support for President Trump.
“A lot of the time I talk to my white friends, they say, ‘Why do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
If I was worried about racism, I’d be out of America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a skit starring Matt Damon. In the skit, the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault allegations of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the show was not broadcast, footage of West's angry remarks was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s unclear if Rock intentionally mocked West for posting this.
West also complained to the audience that he was uncomfortable being behind a chicken wing because of his hat.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said 'don't go to the show with that hat.'
They bullied me!
Then they said I was bogged down,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you know what a bog is?", saying he would "wear my hero's iconic hat, because no one can force me to do anything. If you want the world to move forward?
Be loving.”
Variety reported that his comments caused the crowd to boo at least twice, and the SNL member was flustered, with one saying: “The whole studio was dumbfounded.”
West was chosen to replace singer Ariana Grande, because her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West made many people confused with the performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Bottle Perrier.
West received the support of the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner. He once posted on Twitter: "Dedicated to one of the bravest souls: PLEASE THANK YOU FOR SAYING UP FOR THE PUBLIC SAY."
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “acting his way, and that’s really cool.”
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying music or costumes, or advocating his or her ‘art’) because I believe that person is pursuing and propagating an ideology that is not good for my community.
He has a right to freedom.
We are too,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, officially "named Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, but follows in the footsteps of Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg formerly known as Snoop Lion; or the late music legend Prince, also changed his name to an icon and later changed his name to Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder in Belfast restaurant stabbing
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
He is scheduled to appear in court at Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Public Prosecution Service.
Angry Game star criticized for toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy television series, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor was quite angry with the hero’s archetype and mentioned that such male characters on screen would make young men feel strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “there’s something wrong here” and asked how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit was recently married to his Game of Thrones co-star, Rose Leslie, 31, and admitted that he felt it was 'quite necessary' to address the issue.
“At this point, I personally feel like I don’t know what we’ve done wrong with so-called masculinity?” he said.
“What have we taught men as adults about the problems that lie ahead?”
Kit believes that television may also be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity caused by the incredibly masculine characters they build.
He continued: ‘What characteristics are innate and what characteristics come from education?
How does what is taught on TV and in the street make boys feel like they have to become male stereotypes?
I think this is really a dilemma of this age – how do we change?
Because obviously there was something unreasonable with our young boys.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not be participating in any more prequels or spin-offs about Game of Thrones, after the series ends next summer, stating that he is “tired of the battlefield and the horse.”
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard’s remake of True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife, Rose, was the best thing when he decided to stop playing Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, it’s where the beginning of my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Jon Snow's character Kit played in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018, on the grounds of the Leslie family home in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new infections
China has announced that the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health officials say the country has more than 820,000 people with the disease.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, the number of new cases recorded was 40,000.
The vast majority of new infections are caused by sexually transmitted infections. This is a big change from the past.
In the past, the rapid spread of HIV in some parts of China was due to blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV along this route has fallen to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 annually.
Sexually transmitted HIV infection is a serious problem that is taking place in the LGBT community in China.
Although homosexuality is no longer considered illegal in China since 1997, discriminatory behavior towards the LGBT community is still very common.
Because of the country’s conservative traditional values, the study estimates that 70 to 90 percent of men eventually end up getting married, despite having sex with men.
Many people are infected with the century-old disease due to insufficient use of protection during same-sex sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed to providing HIV medicines to all infected patients to cope with the disease.
Maxine Waters denies her staff leaked data of Republican senators, highlights 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican senators on a Wikipedia page about lawmakers.
Democrats in Los Angeles insist that the complaints were orchestrated by “far-right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies and lies are even more despicable,” Waters wrote in a post on Twitter.
According to the report, the leak included the home address and phone numbers of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, from Utah.
The information began appearing online on Thursday by an unidentified person in the Capitol during a Senate hearing on sexual assault allegations against the candidate for the post of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The revelation came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identified the source of posts related to Waters’ office and revealed information about one of Waters’ employees.
Waters went on to say: “This unfounded allegation is completely untrue and is absolutely a lie.”
“The staff in my office have suffered a breach of identity, personal information and safety as a result of these false and false allegations it is impossible for a person to reveal such information.
This unfounded allegation is completely untrue and is absolutely a lie.”
Waters' comments drew immediate online criticism, including that of former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This statement of rejection is an expression of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This shows she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of a behavior that wasn’t their doing, one shouldn’t get angry.
They are not challenged.
They were not questioned about the motives of the person making the accusation.
They have to show calmness and serenity.”
Fleischer appears to be comparing Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh's response to Democratic Party criticism and critics also allege that he was overly irate during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican running for Waters in the midterm elections, also took to Twitter to express his views.
"Big if true," he wrote on Twitter.
Waters claimed that her office had alerted “law enforcement and authorities to these false allegations.
“We will make sure the perpetrators are brought to justice,” she continued, “and they will be held accountable for all actions that could have been harmful and dangerous to any of my staff.”
Johnny English Returns as Rowan Atkinson's Useless Spy
Now, a fairly traditional trend can be seen in any new film whose British element is a search for the meaning of Brexit. And the next episode of the action-comedy series about spying Johnny English is no exception. The series began in 2003, with the name Johnny English and part 2 called Johnny English - Re-export, released in 2011.
Will the act of mocking ourselves about how useless we are becomes a new export opportunity for this country?
At any rate, Johnny English’s limited powers with his wide eyes and flexible facial muscles are allowed to shuffle things up again – his name simply stands for a comic book designed for non-English speaking areas.
Of course he was a secret agent, though he always feigned oddity in the style of Inspector Clouseau, mixing Mr Bean’s humor and a little something that contributed to the Chariots of Fire theme tune at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
The character's prototype is also based on the traveler and international mystery man that Atkinson once starred in the Barclaycard TV commercial that has now sunk into obscurity and caused chaos upon waking.
There are quite a few interesting scenes in the latest Johnny English episode.
I liked the scene of Johnny English approaching the helicopter while wearing his medieval armor and the propellers beating on his hat.
Although Atkinson’s humor is fully expressed, the humor here seems not enough weight and a bit redundant, especially when “serious” movie brands like the 007 series and The Impossible Mission have made comedy just a spice.
The humor in this movie can only make fun of children, I myself think that Johnny English’s silly mistakes are nothing as creative and remarkable as the jokes in Atkinson’s silent film Mr. Bean.
The situation that led to the story was that Britain was in serious trouble.
Hackers infiltrated Britain’s super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all active British agents outside, leading to the dismay of an on-duty agent, a regrettable little role played by Kevin Eldon.
This was the prime minister’s last chance, a proud and powerful figure, now facing this rare political crisis: Emma Thompson did a good job of playing Teresa May’s version, but she didn’t have a lot of room in the script.
Intelligence advisers reported that the identities of all active agents had been exposed and that she would have to mobilise a retired agent.
And that person is the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches in the countryside, but in fact teaches out-of-the-box lessons to become a secret agent: there are some interesting jokes here, because English teaches students to be spies in the style of the Rock Academy.
English is summoned back to Whitehall Court for an emergency meeting and reunites with his former aide Bough, played by actor Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, asking to hitch a ride on a glamorous female luxury submarine commander. Vicki Pepperdine takes on this somewhat talent-wasting role.
So Batman and Robin troubleshoot the Queen's Order to return to duty and meet Olga Kurylenko as the beautiful spy Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in jeopardy under the spell of the seductive tech billionaire after claiming he can solve every British computer headache: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on an adventure of unimaginable antics: after disguising themselves as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant in the blink of an eye; causing chaos on Volta’s luxury yacht; and English made even more chaos when it sought to use its VR headset to probe Volta’s home.
At the end of the movie, the knots are sure to be removed, but such excitement is quite like the TV channels for children.
It's a rather ordinary piece of work.
And like the other Johnny English films, I can’t help but ask: Is the British film industry really going to give Rowan Atkinson a fair, meritorious role?
Labour denies it is developing a plan to allow Britons to work for four days but receive a five-day pay stipend
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider a radical plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week but receive a five-day wage.
According to the information received, the party wants business owners to transfer the money saved by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
This means that employees can take a three-day weekend off but still receive the same salary as before.
Sources said the idea was "consistent" with the party's economic agenda and expected to strengthen support for the country's workers.
The British Trade Union Congress has confirmed the move to a four-day work week is a way for workers to enjoy the benefits of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "The review of policies is expected to be announced later this year.
“This goal is not achievable in the short term, but working four days a week is an aspiration consistent with the party’s policy of rebalancing the economy to the benefit of workers as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour will not be the first to endorse the idea. Britain’s Green Party pledged to work four days a week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, this idea has not yet been adopted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day work week policy is not a party policy and the party does not currently consider it.”
Shadow Prime Minister John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to strengthen his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to wrest power back from "anonymous directors" and "extortionists" at utility companies.
The shadow prime minister’s plans also mean that existing shareholders in water supply companies may not get their full shares back as the Labour government could apply ‘deductibles’ based on behavior deemed wrong.
He also confirmed plans for employees to join the company’s board and set up a comprehensive equity fund to hand over 10 per cent of private companies’ equity to company employees, giving them the ability to receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy on "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh led them to change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote to appoint him to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised questions about whether the Federal Intelligence Service’s findings could cause any Republican senators to withdraw support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, “60 Minutes” reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI had found any evidence that might cause the senators to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I suppose so,” Kennedy said.
“I said during the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the fact, that is, after the accusation was made and asked, ‘Did you do that?’
He replied very firmly, decisively and decisively.”
Graham’s vote, however, appeared to be completely certain.
“I’ve made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and only a powerful allegation can change it for me.”
“Professor Ford, I don’t know about what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett denied it very strongly,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all the people she named couldn’t verify the story.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see any new changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it contribute to the eradication of poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event attended by an impressive star-studded cast to carry out an equally impressive mission: ending world poverty.
In the seventh year of the event, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park’s Great Lawn not only to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event’s true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Hunger Eradication Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
To get free admission to the event (unless you’re willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert attendees must complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful form to help raise awareness of the goal of alleviating poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, now that it has only 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of awarding tickets to a free concert for everyone a practical way to persuade people to call for action, or just another form of “keyboard movement” – people feel they are making a real difference by signing a petition online or submitting a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says more than 10 million “actions” from supporters have been recorded, advancing a range of different goals.
They say these actions have helped spur leaders around the world to make commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set to implement interventions that improve the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from the group’s actions, with at least $10 billion disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far, secured funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partner organization comprised of investors and implementers that is committed to “helping children to the best of their ability,” promising to provide $25 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter posts from the Global Citizens group.
“With support from the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice that has led to undernourishment into a mark in history,” said Nutrition Power Programme Ambassador Tracey Ullman to the audience during a live performance in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called Strength Nutrition, which guarantees nutritional interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the group’s website, “What makes you believe we can end extreme poverty?”
The group Global Citizens responded: “This will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail.
But just like the civil rights and anti-racism movements of the past, we will succeed because together, we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy to block Russian energy exports – Interior Minister
The Washington Examiner quoted U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke as saying that Washington could mobilise the Navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including the Middle East.
Zinke alleges that Russia’s involvement in Syria — more notably at the invitation of the legitimate government — is merely an excuse to probe new energy markets.
According to the report, he said: “I believe the reason they entered the Middle East was because they wanted to trade in energy, as in Eastern Europe, Europe’s southern low-lying region.”
And according to official information, there are many ways and measures to prevent this.
“The U.S. has the capability to use the Navy to ensure that sea lanes of communication remain open and will close, when necessary, to ensure that their energy sources are not brought to market,” he said.
Zinke called on attendees to the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that bills itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the U.S.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, noting that the two are equally effective.
“The economic alternative that Iran and Russia can choose is to take advantage of and change the type of fuel,” he said, while calling Russia “the only one who has the strength” with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statements came as the Trump administration is seeking to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, aiming to replace Russia’s position as a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 oil and gas project that, according to Trump, has left Moscow in “complete control” of Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 oil and gas project, built to double its existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply economic and an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we have a shared view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers must be given the choice of suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position provoked a backlash from Germany, which later reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the Confederation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere with the European Union’s energy policy, as well as bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I face a big problem when there is a third country trying to interfere with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Confederation of Industry (BDI) after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “Seriously Consider” Running for President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
In a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider running.
The Hill quoted her as saying: “It’s time for women to come to Washington and fix government’s flaws, and for a woman to be at the top.”
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and said he was "taking the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m really worried about what Donald Trump is going to do to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said "of course the FBI has to investigate before voting."
But a poll on Thursday showed a majority of Warren's voters did not think she should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Political Studies, 58 percent of voters “probably” in Massachusetts said that senators should not run for office.
32% support her running for office.
The poll found that more voters supported former Gov. Deval Patrick running, with 38 percent of voters supporting and 48 percent opposing.
Other potential Democratic candidates to be named in the 2020 presidential race include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported that Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin on Track Palin's PTSD Syndrome at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, served a year in Iraq after signing up in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through when he comes back, I can relate to other families who are also suffering from PTSD and the trauma that our soldiers are carrying when they come back,” she told a crowd at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son's arrest "an obvious problem that no one wants to talk about" and said that her son and other veterans returning from the war "have changed, are more thorny, and wonder if there is respect for them and their fellow soldiers, the Air Force and every other member of the military for what they have done for this country."
Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, said he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assaulting a woman with domestic violence, preventing others from reporting domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
Eighteen states and D.C. support new refugee policy challenge
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting challenging the new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and D.C. sent a brief collective text Friday in Washington in support of asylum seekers opposing the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace and Sessions lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August to protest federal policy has not yet been disclosed.
She said her lover "and his violent gang members' sons" abused her but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Prosecutors for the pro-Grace states described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of people apply for asylum in the United States as countries facing problems of gangs and domestic violence are quite common.
The new U.S. refugee policy runs counter to a 2014 Immigration Appeals Council decision that allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy “ignores the decades-old system of state, federal, and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be reviewed based on the claimant’s specific facts and circumstances and that this obstruction policy violates that principle,” the brief said.
Prosecutors also argued in the brief that the immigration denial policy harmed the U.S. economy, because immigrants were more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labor resources."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked immigration judges not to continue granting asylum to victims who fled domestic violence and gang abuse in June.
“Allow asylum only to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social or political group,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum is never a means of mitigating all the problems – even all the serious ones – that people face on a daily basis all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race for survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly dire.
“It’s really stressful,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother comforting her fever-stricken son at an evacuation center in the desperate city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings in more bodies.
“Clean water is scarce.”
People return to their destroyed homes, gather their belongings in the water, and try to salvage anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were completely overcrowded, following damage from the 7.5-magnitude quake.
Several people were injured, including Dwi Haris, whose back and shoulders were broken and who was resting outside the Palu Military Hospital.
Tears welled up as he recalled the sensation of a violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We don’t even have time to save ourselves.
I think I was thrown into the rubble of the wall,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife crying and crying for help, but then I didn’t hear anything.
I don’t know what happened to my wife and children.
I hope they are all safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American daily referring to the common interests of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press for propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned an additional payment by China Daily to the Des Moines Register — Iowa’s best-selling newspaper — after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is seeking to interfere in the U.S. election marks a new phase in a campaign to ramp up pressure on China, U.S. officials told Reuters.
While it is perfectly normal for foreign governments to place trade-boosting ads, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war, with evidence that they have imposed high tariffs on their imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China’s retaliatory tariffs in the early stages of the trade war have been designed to target exporters in Republican-leaning states such as Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a longtime former governor of Iowa, a state that exports large agricultural goods to China, said Beijing was hurting American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, saying China “is continuing that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free newspaper.”
“In an effort to spread propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America’s tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, at newspaper stands in the streets of Beijing, you will rarely find dissenting views and will not see any genuine reflection of the various Chinese opinions on China’s difficult economic trajectory, because obviously the media are completely under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most popular newspapers has shied away from publishing” his article, though he did not specify which one.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating female voters ahead of midterm elections over Kavanaugh case
As many leading Republicans defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over sexual assault allegations, analysts warn they could face a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions surrounding the incident were strong and most of the Republican candidates on the list indicated they wanted to keep voting.
There are things we can’t do again,” Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he did not think that Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) pressed the consent button for the FBI to conduct enough investigation to appease angry voters.
The Washington, D.C. newspaper quoted Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for progressive group MoveOn on Friday: “Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget tomorrow, and in November they will not forget either.”
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” as they marched in the Senate corridor as the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee chose to continue voting for Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford.
“Enthusiasm and momentum for democracy will be pushed higher than ever,” Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
“It is said that this momentum is already very high; yes.
“But it could be even higher, especially among suburban female voters and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds who typically don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford publicly took the oath of office on the details of sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said the public could expect a backlash if Republicans continue their confirmation.
Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said last week: “This could turn into a mess that the Republican Party has to deal with.”
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the formal vote, or whether Kavanaugh becomes a Supreme Court justice, it’s more about how Republicans handle the impeachment and how they treat the accuser,” Guy Cecil, the director of Priorities USA, a group that supports Democratic candidates, told the news channel.
The American public, however, disagrees about whether to trust Ford’s or Kavanaugh’s testimony, and many seem more suspicious of Kavanaugh.
A new YouGov poll found that 41 percent of respondents said they believed or could trust Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they were sure or could trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents thought Kavanaugh could or would have definitely lied when it came to testimony, while only 30 percent thought Ford was certain or could have lied.
After Flake pushed the button, the FBI was investigating Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford took the oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her drunk, when she was 17.
Ramirez accused the Supreme Court nominee of exposing his genitals to her when they attended a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Start Building New Internet to Take Over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is now launching a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project is called Inrupt, a company built on Berners-Lee’s open-source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where data is stored and what rights people are granted to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt project was to “dominate the world.”
“We have to start now,” he said of the startup.
"Now is the historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows users to create their own “online personal data warehouse” or POD.
This data warehouse can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, they’re all available on one browser and display simultaneously.
What is unique about this online trove of personal data is that users have full discretion over who can access what type of information.
The company calls it “giving control of data to individuals.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea of the Inrupt project is to make sure the company equips the right resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company now has Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, several developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about a complete change because all of their business models can be upgraded overnight.
“We don’t need their permission.”
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Association at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential name in the debate over net neutrality.
Despite the launch of Project Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Association, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Commemorating the day Bernard Vann received the Victoria Cross during World War I
The 100th anniversary of the award of Queen Victoria's Cross during World War I as a warrior was celebrated in his home country.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the Order on 29 September 1918 in the assaults on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he died from sniper fire four days later and was never personally known to have won the British Army's highest honour.
On Saturday, two of his grandsons unveiled a commemorative stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of Vann's nephews, Michael, said it was "a brilliant symbol" when the stone was displayed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's victory.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann commanded his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through thick fog, under heavy fire from rifles and machine guns."
He then charged straight into the fire and with "great bravery" led the battalion to the top, before charging at a rifleman and killing three commandos.
Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “an act I myself could never have done, but there was humility there.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the Royal Brentwood Young Band led parade.
Michael Vann said he was "deeply honored to be part of the parade" and that "the bravery of a true hero will be recognised with the support of so many people."
Martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but they ended up getting only Peppa Pig
Imagine you stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206 with its packed stands, but ended up being turned down for the main event.
The show's introduction from San Jose said there were 13 fights, including six on the main card and was shown live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to fight, viewers in England were stunned when the screen turned into Peppa Pig.
Some people feel disrespected after they wake up to watch the game.
One fan expressed on Twitter that turning the show into a children’s cartoon was like “an ungainly joke.”
“The government stipulates that martial arts content shown at 6 a.m. is inappropriate, so they have to be turned into children’s shows,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the move.
"Peppa the pig," yes.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said it was reviewing the broadcast schedule to ensure British audiences could watch the show in the future.
Mr. Coker said, “I think if we replay it, we can solve the problem.”
“But over there it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday and we can’t handle the issue until Sunday in our time zone, but Monday in their time zone.
But we are trying to find a solution.
Believe me, when people change programs, there are a lot of messages going back and forth and those messages are not very friendly.
We tried to fix it, initially we thought it was a technical glitch.
But in the end, it's not, it's government regulation.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
“We will reduce the number of matches to five, instead of the six that we originally expected – five is the number of matches we normally provide and we have tried to deliver the excess to the fans.
This is truly an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'poor' about sexual orientation
Olympic jumper Tom Daley said that when he grew up, he always felt inferior to everyone because of his sexual orientation – but that was the reason for his success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t realize he was “like no one” until he learned in school.
Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about the rights of gay men to give "hope" to others.
He also said becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off to recover.
In the first issue led by Laverne, Daley appeared as an outcast, stating that he felt "poorly losing" everyone, because "his gender was not as socially accepted as boys and girls obviously."
He said: “To this day, the feeling of inferiority and difference still exists, becoming the motivation and strength for me to be successful.”
He wanted to prove that he had “achieved something” so that people wouldn’t be disappointed to learn the truth about his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become an active campaigner for the LGBT community and he used his image at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to fight discrimination against homosexuals.
He said he spoke up because he felt so lucky to be able to live openly without discrimination and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion shared that he fell in love with a man - American film producer Dustin Lance Black. The two met in 2013 and "suddenly fell in love."
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he says the age difference has never been an obstacle.
“When you’re going through so much suffering as a child” — he first competed at the Olympic Games when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later — it’s hard to find someone the same age as him to experience ups and downs in his life.
The couple became parents to Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his "worldview" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, my goal was ‘I have to win the gold medal,’” he said.
“But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medallist is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was dying and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012 – because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You can't sit in the front row anymore,'" he said.
“I held his hand as he took his last breath and even as he stopped breathing and was gone forever, I couldn’t finally admit that he had to be invincible.”
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
“I just know that it’s been my dream of a lifetime – to jump off a bridge in front of a crowd of fans at the Olympic Games, there’s really no better feeling than that,” he said.
This was also the inspiration for him to choose his first song – Proud by Heather Small – the song that accompanies him in his training towards the Olympic Games and still makes him emotional every time he hears it again.

Mickelson lacks form on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday for playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to improve to avoid this record becoming a sad experience.
Mickelson played in the biennial event 12 times but captain Jim Furyk put him on the bench in Saturday’s fourball and foursome series.
Instead of being the center of action as it was in the U.S., this five-time winner spends his days cheering and playing games in hopes of escaping discomfort.
The 48-year-old with the knack of hitting on the flat has never been the ideal choice for Le Golf National, even when he is at the peak of his form, because the wrong shots here will suffer heavy consequences.
And if the course isn't haunting enough, Mickelson is set to play in Sunday's ninth game against British Open champion Francesco Molinari. This week, Molinari paired up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and won all four.
If the US team, which is currently losing by 4 points before the start of the 12-match singles series, wants to start impressively, Mickelson’s match is paramount.
Furyk expressed confidence in his golfer and did not say too much.
“He understands his role very well today, he patted me on the back, put his arms around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He is very confident.
He is a legend and has contributed a lot to the team, in the past and throughout this week.
I never thought he would play two games.
I envisioned more, but that’s how things went and we thought that was the right path.
He wants to play, just like all his teammates.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record as the Ryder Cup's most capped player.
It could also be the end of his career at the Ryder Cup because the peaks of his personal record have never been seen in this tournament.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and a draw, although Furyk considers his presence to be an intangible value to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's witty, he likes to make fun of people. Having him in the group is really fun," he explained.
“I think young golfers are happy to see him and this week has been pretty good.
“What he gave was more than a fight.”
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the lead can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, has the experience that even if his team has a lot of lead when entering the Ryder Cup final singles matches, the results can still be easily reversed in a way that is not pleasant at all.
The Dane began playing in 1997 in Valderrama, in which their team, led by Seve Ballesteros, was five points ahead of the US team but ended up winning by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You have to remind yourself all the time that we used to be a lot ahead at Valderrama; we used to be a lot ahead at Brookline and we lost, at Valderrama, we won, but we struggled,” Bjorn said, with the look on his face after watching the Class of 2018 match with a 5-3 win on Friday and a 10-6 lead yesterday at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that it's not the end.
You still have to be mentally focused tomorrow.
Go out there and play well.
The tournament is not over when the score is not yet on the board.
We have a goal to win the cup this year and that is our focus.
I’ve always said I focus on my 12 players, but we also know the strength of your team – they’re the best in the world.”
Excited about the performance of his golfers on the bumpy golf course, Bjorn added: “I’ll never say anything.
Tomorrow will be another war.
Tomorrow is an individual show and it will be different.
It would be great to play in pairs and everything goes smoothly. But when you play individually, all the possibilities of a golfer will be revealed.
That’s the message that you have to share with every golfer, that they have to be ready to play their best tomorrow.
Now a couple have to separate and each one has to be ready for the best.”
In contrast to Bjorn, the opposing captain, Jim Furyk expected his players to perform better individually than when playing in pairs, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself went through both directions in major turning points on the final day, having been a member of the winning team at Brookline before failing while the European team was hailed as the "Miracle at Medinah."
“I memorize every word,” he said when asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the team’s captain in 1999, had gathered and encouraged golfers before the final day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start as quickly as you see at Brookline, or as you see at Medinah.
When the result is following a trend, the matches in the middle will be under a lot of pressure.
We built the team that way and sent players on the field strategically and tried to do the miracle tomorrow.”
Thomas was tasked with leading the team and facing Rory McIlroy in the top-flight game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other European players in the first series.
"I choose this group, in that order because I believe it's the way to go," Bjorn said of his selection for the singles match.
New German warship to be delayed from entering service
The German Navy’s newest destroyer was supposed to go on trial in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warship, but it won’t be until next year due to faulty systems and rising costs.
A military spokesman told Die Zeit: "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class destroyer, has been delayed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery troubles hampered the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
That means the ships will be armed with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic tracks.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it is possible to deploy the latest frigates away from national ports for up to two years.
However, the ongoing delay means that these modern warships – which are supposed to give Germany control of foreign countries – will become obsolete by the time they begin to use them, Die Zeit notes.
The unlucky F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to run trials and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Very little is known about the reason behind the return, but German media referred to severe "software and hardware flaws" that would render the warship useless for combat duty.
The software error was particularly serious because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate would be operated by a fleet of 120 sailors – half the manpower of the old Bremen-class destroyer.
At the same time, it can be seen that the weight of the ship increases significantly, leading to a decrease in performance and limiting the future upgrade capacity of the Navy.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz was believed to weigh twice as much as the same warship used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – was also a serious issue.
The project is said to have significantly invested up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – while the initial estimated cost is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The issue of mobilizing the newest destroyer has become particularly important, amid recent warnings of shrinking German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament’s defense committee, acknowledged that the Navy really “lacks warships capable of fighting.”
The official said the problem is getting worse over time, because older ships have been decommissioned but there are no replacements.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships qualified to join the Navy.
The National Trust overhears the secret life of bats.
A new study is being conducted on a plot of land in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use natural landscapes to hunt for food.
It is hoped these findings will shed light on the behaviour of this unique flying mammal and guide future conservation activities.
The study, led by National Trust for Scotland, tracked the journeys of common bats, soprano pipistrelles, brown-eared bats and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the study grounds to monitor the activity of these bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
The expert will analyze all sound recordings and determine the frequency of bat sounds and the purpose of playing the sounds of specific bat genera.
Then maps and habitat reports of bats will be made to get a detailed picture of their behavior according to the natural landscape.
Rob Dewar, NTS conservation adviser, hopes the results will help determine which habitats are most important for bats and how each species lives in that environment.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management activities, such as grassland planting, and how best to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect bat bean platforms and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and light systems, flytrap paper, some chemical treatments for building materials, as well as pet cat attacks can also pose a risk to bats.
Bats are not completely blind.
However, due to the habit of hunting at night, the ears are more useful than the eyes when snooping and catching prey.
They use an extremely sophisticated echolocation technique to identify obstacles on the flight path.
NTS is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, and attaches special importance to bats.
The organization has ten trained professionals who regularly carry out surveys, examinations and sometimes participate in animal rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at Threave estates in Dumfries and Galloway. It is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The land manager, David Thompson, said the land was ideal territory for them.
"Threave is a great habitat for bats," he said.
“We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of big trees and good habitat.
But there is still a lot of mystery about bats, so the work here and at other facilities will help us better understand what bats need to thrive further."
He stressed the importance of checking the life of bats before conserving in the grounds, because accidentally destroying their breeding grounds can kill up to 400 females and vomiting, almost completely destroying the population.
Bats are protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their pods.
Elisabeth Ferrell, of the Scottish Bat Conservation Foundation, encouraged the community to get involved.
“We still need to learn more about bats, and with many species, we don’t know how far apart their populations are.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations and his lawyer prepares to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo says sex allegations against him are "fake news" and that someone "wants to profit" in his name.
His lawyer is set to sue the German daily Der Spiegel for publishing the allegation.
The Portugal forward who currently plays for Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the player allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
In a live-stream on Instagram in front of 142 million followers hours after the allegation was announced, Ronaldo, 33, insisted the report was “fake news”.
"No, no, no.
What they’re saying today is all fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball winner told the camera.
“They want to use my name for profit.
That's just normal.
To say my name, they’re famous, but that’s just part of the job.
I am a happy person and all is well," the player added, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "unacceptable reporting of suspicions about private life".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in the amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is possibly one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, according to records filed in Clark County Court, Nevada, where he was accused of raping her at the hotel.
Mayorga said that Ronaldo got down on his knees after the alleged incident and said that he was "99 percent" a "good person", with only "1%" not good.
It is alleged that Ronaldo confirmed that the two sides had sexual relations, but based on consensus.
Mayorga also said she went to the police station and was photographed with her injuries at the hospital, but she later agreed to mediate out of court because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried because of "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old said she is now seeking to overturn her previous decision to mediate as she continues to suffer trauma as a result of the alleged incident.
At the time the allegation was made, Ronaldo was preparing to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but finally this summer he switched to play for Italian giants Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million transfer deal.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' losing car maker status
Business Minister Greg Clark said the UK would “forever regret” losing its global lead in car production after Brexit.
He added that it was "worrisome" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK left the European Union without any further agreement it would cease production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90 percent of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK were to completely leave the European Union by the end of March then we would have to stop production at this plant,” said Marvin Cooke, chief executive of Toyota Motor Corporation in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have also raised concerns about Britain leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern for automakers is supply chain risk in the event of Brexit without another deal.
Toyota’s production line operates on the “just-in-time” principle, with parts delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers in the United Kingdom and the European Union for custom-made vehicles.
If Britain leaves the EU without another deal on March 29, there is a possibility of disruption at the border and the sector fears it could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
Toyota says it can't keep inventory values for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, so it will have to stop production.
Mr Clark said Prime Minister Theresa May's Chequers plan for relations with the European Union in the future would be "corrected to avoid checks at the border".
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal, not only to ensure success in the present, but to make sure we seize this opportunity well," he said in BBC Radio 4.
“The evidence from Toyota as well as other car manufacturers shows that we need to ensure continued supply chain success.”
Toyota hasn’t announced how long it will inevitably stop production, but in the long run, it warned that the additional costs will reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually, workers will lose their jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and was the convener of the Unite union at the plant, said his members were increasingly worried: “It’s my experience that once these jobs are lost, it’s never going to happen again.
A government spokesman said: “We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the European Union.”
White House says meeting between Trump and Rosenstein may be delayed again
The White House announced on Sunday that President Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "backtrack another week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election meddling, links between Trump and Russian aides and the president’s ability to obstruct justice.
Whether or not Trump fired the deputy attorney general, which led to Mueller’s inability to operate independently, has sparked months of rumors in Washington.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing headphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amid speculation that he was about to resign.
Instead, his meeting with Trump — who was visiting the U.N. General Assembly in New York at the time — was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "didn't want" Rosenstein's dismissal but the meeting was delayed to avoid conflict with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing between Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct who testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to spend a week investigating the allegations against Kavanaugh, while continuing to delay the full Senate vote.
President Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, she said: “The date of the meeting has not been set, it could be this week, it could be seen that the reason for this postponement is because of other issues going on at the Supreme Court.
But we’ll get the news soon and the press will be updated.”
Some reporters may disagree: Sanders has not held a White House briefing since Sept. 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press briefings was not due to a dislike of TV reporters "too much", although she once said: "I also agree that reporters are, in fact, a lot of stories."
She then suggested that there should be more direct contact between President Trump and the press.
“The president is currently doing more Q&A sessions than any previous president,” she added, without elaborating: “We have reviewed the number of press conferences.”
Sanders said there would still be press conferences but "if the press gets a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, that's a lot better than talking to me.
"We've worked very hard and you've seen a lot of work that we've had to do over the last few weeks, which will take the place of a press conference when you can talk directly to the president of the United States."
Trump frequently answers questions when leaving the White House or when attending open-door meetings or during press conferences when a visiting official is present.
Press conferences are very rare.
This week, in New York, the president was supposed to announce the reason, but he appeared suddenly and strangely in front of a crowd of reporters.
Health minister writes letter to EU staff working in health sector in Scotland to talk about Brexit fears
The health minister has written to European Union staff working in the health sector in Scotland to express his country’s gratitude and his desire for staff to remain in the country after Brexit.
Health Minister Jeane Freeman has sent a letter with the message that she will resign within six months of the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish Government is committed to supporting the cost of applications for the certification of residency status of citizens of the European Union who are working in the public service sector that has been transferred.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “Over the course of this summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union regarding the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union continued, with a decision expected to be made this autumn.
But the government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this has been a turbulent time for all of you.
That’s why I want to reiterate that I greatly appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Moreover, colleagues from the European Union have brought valuable experience and skills to help strengthen and improve health services, while benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
“Scotland is absolutely your home and we’d love for you to stay.”
Christion Abercrombie to undergo emergency surgery after head injury
Tigers forward Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury in Saturday’s 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the first half-time break.
“He ran towards the border and collapsed,” Reed said.
Trainers and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen at the border before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further tests.
An official from Tennessee told Chris Harris at the WSMV tournament in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details are yet available on the extent/type of injury” and that the state of Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student of the red team, first played for Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five games on Saturday before being ruled out and he has a total of 18 games this season.
Foreigners who buy property in the UK will be charged a higher tax
Foreigners who buy property in the UK will be charged a higher tax rate, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under Tory’s new policies.
This change will successfully nullify Corbyn’s attempt to appeal to young voters
The tax increase will apply to those who do not pay their taxes in the UK.
The finance ministry expects the policy to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year – to help the homeless.
Foreigners buying property in the UK will be charged a higher tax rate – the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday.
The change will successfully nullify Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to appeal to young voters with a commitment to provide cheaper housing and target high-income earners.
The tax increase will apply to individuals and businesses who do not pay their taxes in the UK, an increase that will boost the government’s efforts to combat the current stagnation.
Surcharges — in addition to the current tax rate, which includes the higher taxes announced two years ago on second homes and homes purchased just for that — can be as high as three percent.
The finance ministry expects the change to help raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of newly built properties in London have been sold to non-citizens, which has pushed up prices and made it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost towns” as the majority of foreigners who buy homes spend most of their time in other countries.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to give more young people the chance to own their first home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping property prices high by taking land but not using it, and called on May to scrap quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain's "housing problems".
Mr Corbyn also announced a series of housing reforms aimed at attracting voters, including controlling rents and ending "faultless" evictions.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my term to reviving the British dream - that life would be better for a new generation.
And that means regulating the housing market, which is very chaotic right now.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, this does not mean that people who do not live in the UK and companies based abroad can easily buy a home as hardworking British residents.
For a lot of people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant and stagnation is still huge.”
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland’
Sunderland boss Jack Ross said his "ultimate ambition" was to become Scotland manager at some point.
Scot, 42, is facing the challenge of reviving the North East club, which currently holds third place in League One, three points behind first.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I want to play for my country as a player.
I had a hat with a B logo and that’s exactly what I wanted,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
"My five months of childhood have been associated with those Scottish matches that took place in Hampden with my father, and that's always something that reminds me.
However, that opportunity will only come if I am successful in managing the club.”
Former Sunderland managers before Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager said he did not feel the pressure of being a successor to the big names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me at the moment will be measured by ‘can I get the club back into the Premier League?’
The organisational structure and facilities at this club definitely belong to the Premier League,” he said.
"This is not a task to be achieved so easily, but I would consider myself successful only if I could bring the club back into the league."
Ross only spent three years as a manager, after a stint as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to third place, and took St Mirren from relegation to champions the following season.
Ross said he is now comfortable throughout his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real turning point,” he recalled in his role leading Alloa.
“I really believe that I’m more suited to being a manager than a player.
This may sound strange because I was quite successful, had a good income and achieved certain achievements as a player.
But the game is usually not easy.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of the job but I feel satisfied with the job management.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now I’m doing it, and I feel most comfortable being myself for the rest of my adult life.”

Surveys show that the ideal time to enjoy a beer is 5.30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heatwave has boosted sales for struggling pubs in the UK but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw sales rise 2.7 percent in July — but sales at restaurants fell 4.8 percent, according to the data.
Peter Martin, of business consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, said: “Prolonged sunshine and England’s insider turnout at the World Cup made July’s sales trend similar to June’s, when pubs rose 2.8 per cent, while restaurants were hit harder.
Sales at restaurants slumped 1.8 percent in June and worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that specialize in beverages experienced the fastest growth when compared to declines at restaurants.
Pubs that specialize in food are also affected by the heat, though not as severe as restaurants.
It looks like everyone just wants to drink.
Sales of drinks at managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent for the month while sales of food fell by 3 percent.”
Paul Newman, entertainment and hospitality industry analyst at RSM, said: “These results represent a trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to revenue at restaurants.
Unsurprisingly, restaurants continued to struggle, with revenue down 4.8 percent year-on-year while cost pressures continued to rise.
"The prolonged summer heat has come at the worst time for food suppliers, not knowing in August when the weather is cooler could improve the current situation."
Total revenue growth in pubs and restaurants, including new locations, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the brand’s rollout.
Coffer Peach Tracker’s sales monitoring for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK collected and analyzed data on job performance from 47 active teams, with combined sales of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and that’s the industry benchmark.
One in five children have a secret social media account that their parents don’t know about.
One in five children — some as young as 11 — have secret social media accounts that parents and teachers don’t know about, survey finds
Results of a survey of 20,000 middle school students showed that the number of "Virtual Instagram" pages has increased significantly
The news has raised concerns about the rise of online pornography.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “primary” account to show parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed rapid growth in “fake Insta” accounts — a reference to photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has added to concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they used a “master” account with no bad content to show their parents, while also having their own account.
A mother found the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, and saw a teenager urging others to "rape me".
According to research by the UK Digital Content Awareness Society and the Principals’ Seminar (HMC) at private schools, 40% of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of them admit to having their own accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It’s worrying that so many teens are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers can’t find.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "representative of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish athletics board as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland, and president Ian Beattie sees the change as a great opportunity for sports coaches to use her rich competitive experience on the international stage over the past decade.
“Eilidh is so respected in the Scottish athletics community, the UK and around the world, we are sure that athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit by electing her to the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to act as a representative for the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
An American, who won the gold medal in the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, he has all four Olympic gold medals and he is now a permanent commentator for the BBC, having been unable to walk after experiencing a mild stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I can't go.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or what condition I was in.
It’s been a grueling journey but to fully recover, relearn how to walk again and now I’m able to walk fast!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
Breastfeeding ads comparing mothers to dairy cows have divided public opinion online
A company specializing in breast pumps has divided online opinion with an ad comparing nursing mothers to milked cows.
To mark the launch of what was billed as “the world’s first wearable and noise-free breast pump”, consumer technology company Elvie has launched an ad inspired by the satirical music video to express the freedom the new breast pump gives mothers.
Four moms dance in a barn full of hay to a song with the lyrics: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tails and "In case you don't realize, these aren't my breasts, they're my breasts."
The chorus goes on: "Suck it out, suck it out, I'm feeding the kids, suck it out, suck it out, I'm milking my girls."
However, this ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, has caused a lot of controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from audiences, many of whom said that the ad disregarded the "horror" of the dairy industry.
“It’s a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must also become pregnant and give birth to babies in order to produce milk, except that the calves are stolen from the mother within a few days of giving birth,” one person wrote.

Another commented: “This can be psychologically damaging for both the mother and the baby.
That's right, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are breastfeeding?"
Another added: “This ad has nothing to do with it.”
There were people who also defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "funny".
“I think this is a unique idea.
I'll buy one for myself if I'm still breastfeeding.
“Smoking really makes me feel like a cow.
This ad is a little crazy, but I get the message.
This is a unique product,” remarked another.
Another commented: "This is an interesting ad aimed at moms who need to pump (usually at work or in the toilet) and feel like 'cows'.
This is not an ad praising or evaluating the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they were dancing with a breast pump hidden in their bras.
The idea behind this campaign is based on the fact that many women who suck to breastfeed say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie breast pump does not make noise, has no wires or tubes and sits discreetly inside a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their baby, and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie breast pump is truly a revolutionary product, worthy of a bold introduction and encouraging curiosity.
When we compare women to dairy cows, we want people to know about dairy and the challenges involved, and to playfully and empathically express the freedom that new dairy products give mothers.
This is not the first time Elvie breast pumps have appeared in newspaper headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on designer Marta Jakubowski’s catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly move to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children in detention has spiked even though the monthly number of people crossing the border has remained almost unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies have made the process of getting children to donors more difficult.
Traditionally, most sponsors had been undocumented immigrants, and they were concerned that accepting an immigrant child could affect their ability to remain in the United States.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential donors and other adult members of their families would have to be fingerprinted, and the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people applying for funding for unguarded minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of donors or family members of donors are here illegally, and the majority of them have criminal records.
So we are continuing to prosecute these individuals,” Albence said.
To be able to quickly handle cases involving these children, officials have introduced new rules that require some donors to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, according to the previous standard.
Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are considered ineligible for sponsorship will be promptly deported.
The longer children are detained, the more anxious or depressed they become, which can lead to violent behavior or attempts to escape, according to staff at the refugee camps and according to reports from the system in recent months.
Supporters said concerns were growing at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where they saw a struggling child more likely to be ignored due to the size of the camp.
They added that taking children to refugee cities without giving them enough time to prepare mentally or say goodbye to friends could be psychologically damaging for many children.
Syria asks 'occupation forces' of US, France and Turkey to withdraw from the country immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the civil war entering its eighth year.
Moualem, the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, in the name of fighting terrorism, so “will be dealt with.”
“They must leave Syria unconditionally and immediately,” he told the council.
Moualem stressed that the "war on terror in Syria is nearing its end", adding that more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “struggling in this jihad until we purge terrorist groups from the entire Syrian territory” and the “illegal presence of foreign forces.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, specialising in training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 infantry in the war-torn country.
On refugees, Moualem said conditions in the former country were good enough for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fear" that the refugees would not return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of refugees,” he said.
“They are using the political card for humanitarian issues.”
The United States and the European Union have warned there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last rebel enclave of Idlib has created an opportunity to advance political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which is home to three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the deal had a “clear deadline” and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists including fighters from Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front who “will be wiped out.”
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, which includes the government and opposition members, soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying its work was limited to “reviewing the provisions of the current constitution” and warning against interfering in elections.
Why Trump will win a second term
Logically, the president will win re-election in 2020 unless impeachment proceedings and scandals bring an end to the presidency ahead of schedule, as liberals are hoping.
This is, of course, "the most dramatic act of a presidency!"
So far, there are no signs of cooling.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News now has 2.4 million prime-time viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” topped the cable chart with more than 3.5 million people watching prime news scores.
“Even if you don’t understand it, a lot of people are drawn to it,” said Neal Baer, who runs ABC’s “Designated Survivor” television show, about a cabinet secretary becoming president after an attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: and " Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
She recalled taking a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Trump.
You asked why?
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Scovell told me.
This is a very interesting thing in the context of chaos.
Of course, unlike what happens on TV, any move by Washington could decide the future of Roe v. Wade, or the issue of the reunion of immigrant families and the global economic situation.
Only certain television viewers have the privilege of choosing their own channels.
Not only that, but it’s even more newsworthy when you spend six hours watching a group of pundits debate Bob Woodward’s use of “in-depth” information in his book “Fear,” or Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich bomber jacket (“a showy outfit,” the Washington Post wrote) and the implications of the over-the-top dissections of the Trump presidency by Stormy Daniels.
I changed my mind about Super Mario.
“One of the things he does is bring you something new every night that makes it feel like a reality TV show,” said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of “Pawn Stars” when talking about the cast and the unexpected happenings of Trump’s daily TV show (such as his fight with N.F.L. or his praise for Kim Jong-un).
You can’t miss an episode or you won’t catch the trend.
This week I had a conversation with Fleiss, outside the house on the north shore of Kauai in 80-degree heat, but he hid inside the house to watch MSNBC while filming for CNN.
He couldn’t leave the television screen, especially when Brett Kavanaugh was testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was on the balance.
“I remember the days we did those crazy shows and people saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Money from outside poured into the most intense midterm elections for the race for the White House.
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district is seeing a rain of cash, due to a congressional district reorganization that has left two incumbents running for the same seat.
The recent geopolitical realignment in Pittsburg district knocked out Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against the Republican nominee, Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district in Pennsylvania, sharing many of the same boundaries as the new 17th district.
The cadastral map was re-planned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were rigged in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has become a financial one between the party’s main donor organizations, the Democratic Committee on Congressional Campaigns (DCCC) and the Republican Committee on National Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb has been a household name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the much-watched special election in March for Pennsylvania’s 18th District Congressional District.
The spot had been in the Republican Party for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the county.
Political commentators have rated the Democrats higher.
U.S. Considered Sanctions on El Salvador for Supporting China, but Rescinded
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had recognized Beijing, with Washington giving little resistance.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and the president once owned a hotel in Panama until business partners fired the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalty only weighs in for El Salvador, which received $140 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions for some, would be devastating for the Central American country, which has high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings were taking place, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic issues to reconvene a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to deter immigrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials had announced that they wanted to move forward with the conference, which would help end the U.S. consideration of penalties against El Salvador.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is now expected to speak at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, when there are signs of taking administrative measures.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a firm message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their information was corroborated by an outside analyst with close ties to the authorities and also spoke anonymously.
Research History
The next bomb could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the president’s obstruction of justice behavior, which now has plenty of evidence in the public record.
It is thought that Mueller is turning his investigation into collusion between Trump and Russia during the presidential election.
If there is a change in the party in Congress, President Trump will face many difficulties in Congress, right before the time to prepare the campaign to get voters, and even with people in the same party.
With so many issues, I’m not suggesting that President Trump’s departure is inevitable – just as it was with his counterparts in Europe.
Both sides of the Atlantic need to make choices that will affect the length of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, if the West also agreed to resist and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid years of carnage.
History revolves around such milestones, and the Democratic Party’s uncompromising struggles will intensify or delay.
Americans face some of these hurdles.
What if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been sitting in a bonfire since a report last year that he proposed secretly recording the president's wiretapping and speculating about the president being unfit for office.
Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
“How will we react if the F.B.I.’s new investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair – or if he confirms it with the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and disingenuous testimony?”
“Above all, will we vote in midterms for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail in these challenges, democracy will lose power for a long time.
But I am confident that we will not fail, for I have learned my lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that had occupied our home.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, she gave me the opportunity to light candles on the altar during the Sabbath.
Given my heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers ahead of clash with Rapid Vienna
Rangers play Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the win over Austria, following an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them the edge to qualify for the Group G round of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard for more great things.
"It's a good thing for us because Villarreal are a strong team," said the 31-year-old.
“We came into the game believing we would get a point.
We could have won at the end, but the draw was not a bad result.
They probably played better in the first half but we counter-attacked in the second half and were in better form.
Thursday is going to be a big game in Europe.
“Hopefully we can get the three points but it will be a tough game because they had a good result in the previous game, but with the backing of the fans I am sure we can get through and get a good result.
Last year was a difficult period, I had injuries and changes at the club but now I have a very good feeling.
Good team, players with good form and good training quality.
Hopefully we can continue to go deeper to achieve a successful new season.”
Women are worried to the point of losing sleep over retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants are well aware of what they care about, few talk to family members.
About half of the Nationwide study participants said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t talk about this,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
Here are the steps to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t mentally prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes first.
Talk to your counselor and family to discuss where and how care is provided, as those options can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a payment method for those costs.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash value life insurance policy to help cover these costs, or purchasing insurance on your own with your own money — as long as you have the money.
Thorough preparation of legal documents: Avoid possible legal battles.
Have a health care plan in place so you can appoint a trusted individual to oversee the medical care process and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider delegating your financial account.
You should choose a reliable person to make financial decisions for you and make sure to pay your bills if you can’t afford it.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
List those details so you’re always ready.
“What about not only financial matters, but also doctor-related matters?” asked Martin.
“What drugs are there?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have you made a plan?”
The man who fired several shots with a rifle in Ilfracombe
One man was shot multiple times with a rifle on his way home during the night.
The victim, aged in her 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arms.
Police described the shooting, which took place at around 02:30 BST, as a "spontaneous act."
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police have called witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the death toll was expected to rise.
Contact was cut off, aid workers were unable to get any information from Donggala authorities, an area north of Palu close to the epicentre of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a fjord on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city is celebrating 40 years when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a capital that extends for more than 300 km (180 mi) along the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The capital, an administrative region administered by the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are two key sectors of the Sulawesi economy, especially in the coastal Donggala region.
Nickel mining is also an important industry here, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by multiple tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia lies within the Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A massive earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggers a tsunami that strikes 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh province.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of eastern Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hits one of the islands of Mentawai, off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami as high as 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake strikes the capital Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing damage and panic as people recall the destruction of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
The earthquake did not cause the tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed as buildings collapsed.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly concentrated in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report on domestic violence and opposing an arrest warrant, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a woman tried to call the police to report the crime, he grabbed his phone.
Palin is being held in custody in Mat-Su and must pay a non-guaranteed $500 bail, according to the KTUU report.
He appeared in court on Saturday, claiming he was "definitely not guilty" when asked for his defence, according to the report.
Palin faces three charges of A-class, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with Class B misdemeanor, jailed for a day and fined $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the attack.
The lawsuit is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with reports of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of unconsciousness related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications networks have been cut off with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just outside the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos are being posted on social media showing the moment of the disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu as the tsunami hit.
Federal Prosecutors Propose Death Penalty for NYC Terror Attack Suspects
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people — a punishment that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out the attack on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on Oct. 10.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, according to the notice of recommendation for the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges could carry the death penalty, according to court documents.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 counts including eight counts of attempted murder, often used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "meticulous planning and advance", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's approach as "brutal, cruel and inhumane".
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian,” the court said in a statement.
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the Southern District of New York implemented the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he was fine with what he was doing, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal defense lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "totally disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
“We think that the decision to carry out the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea to life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the vulnerability of this event for those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to issue the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say Nigel Farage must take responsibility for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people" during a rally at the Conservative Party conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians must “feel the heat” from European sceptics – as one of Prime Minister Theresa May’s MPs suggested he should take charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative supporter Peter Bone told a rally in Birmingham that the UK was "out of the union" right now if Farage was Brexit minister.
But the challenge May faces as she tries to reconcile a deep divide among Conservative MPs who support staying in the European Union has joined a protest against Brexit.
The prime minister is struggling to hold on to his plan to compromise between attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the European Union.
Allies insisted she would push ahead by trying to reach a deal with Brussels despite the backlash – and force European Cynics and the Labour Party to choose between its plans and the “current state of turmoil”.
Bone said during the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to "oppose Chequers".
He suggested Farage should remain in parliament and take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been responsible, we would be out of the coalition by now,” he said.
Wellingborough added: “I would support Brexit but we need to oppose Chequers.”
He testified to his opposition to the European Union: "We do not fight in world wars to be submissive to others.
We want to build our own laws.”
Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the union is completely false.”
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, telling reporters: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Not many people agree with Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for this plan, which usually does not happen with our party, our activists, who are willing to call for the support of the people and vote for us from the beginning.
Give up on Chequers and listen to the people.”
In a message to May, she added: "Prime Ministers hold their seats when they keep their promises to the people."
Farage said politicians must join the protests to “feel the heat” if they are to change a decision made during the 2016 referendum.
“This is a matter of trust between us – the people – and the political class,” he said.
"They're trying to get out of Brexit and we're here today to say 'we're not going to let you do that'.
In a message to his supporters, he added: “I want to let the political class, who are intending to change Brexit, feel the heat of the current situation.
“We are mobilizing the people who delivered the Brexit victory and we will never surrender until we become an independent, self-governing and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, Remaining supporters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists held up Conservative Party banners against Brexit after the group’s debut this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they were facing as the conference opened.
“These are the people who once told us that they could control the IT system and all the technology provided to Canada, including the borderless free trade issue in Ireland,” he added.
“This is absolutely a joke.
“Brexit is not a good thing,” he added.
Warren is determined to run for the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will be determined to "run for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat had spoken about her future when she spoke at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a longtime critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November, in a race with GOP Rep. Geoff Diehl, who served as co-chairman of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
People speculated that she might take over Trump’s position in 2020.
Saturday’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
One attendee asked her about her intention to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for "women to get into politics to reform government and have a woman at the top."
Man arrested in shooting death of LSU player Sims
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that a suspect was arrested in the fatal shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m.
They released video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, on sports channel 247.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, possessing a weapon and confessing to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was immediately arrested and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 1.98-meter-tall teenager and raised at Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 in his first team last season with an average playing time of 17.4 minutes, winning 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton takes world championship after victory over Sebastian Vettel
Valtteri Bottas clearly had an advantage over Lewis Hamilton on Saturday as Mercedes remained a strong team at the season.
From the starting point, Bottas got off to a good start and successively overtook Hamilton to defend his place in the first two laps and have Vettel battling his own team-mates.
Vettel got into the first pit and abandoned Hamilton when re-entering the track, a decisive action.
The Mercedes entered the pit behind Vettel, but Hamilton was ahead because the driver in the Ferrari had to slow down to avoid the risk after two races to protect the third place.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the race and finished seventh at the end of the first leg on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead throughout the race as he did not change the tire to finish quickly and overtook Kimi Raikkonen to take fourth place.
He ended up in the pit in the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was a tough race because Valtteri did very well at the weekend and he was a really good driver.
The team finally had an excellent race to win the number one and number two titles," Hamilton said.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Sen. Dianne Feinstein at the campaign rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford on Supreme Court charges in the Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault case.
Speaking during the West Virginia campaign, the president did not directly address the announcement made by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were “with bad intent and dishonest.”
“Something happened and what’s going on in the last few days in the Senate is so great, you can feel the anger, you can see the angry, bad and nasty people, and you can see the dishonesty.
“When they look at the articles and read the leaked news, they say, ‘Oh, I’m not the one to do that.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, you leaked the news, didn't you?
Remember her answer... you leaked the documents, right? "God, what's going on?
No, no, no.
I didn't leak."
Come on, let's wait a minute.
Did we leak it ... No, we didn’t do it,” the president said, parody of the senator’s words.
Feinstein was sent a letter by Ford detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh in July and the information was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that her office leaked the information.
“I’m not hiding Dr. Ford’s allegations, I’m not leaking her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it as secret as she asked.”
But the president seemed unhappy about her refusal, and he commented on the campaign trail Saturday night: “I’ll tell you about that, it’s really very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president argues that Democrats are using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power by any means.
You will find meaning and discomfort because they don’t care who they hurt, they want power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars won 5-3 against Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars offset Friday’s loss to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League with a 5-3 win in the second leg at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored two early goals thanks to goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized for the home team before Dwyer added points for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard continued to equalize for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored twice to help the team win the final.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League season of the team led by Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2-1 in a match played in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth encounter between the two sides this season, and the Giants have won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford also helped Beauvillier double the lead four minutes later.
In the early minutes, Sullivan helped the team shorten the score in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt became the player who helped Cownie level the score in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the first half by scoring the second goal at the end of the half.
The home team consulted and Bouchard again leveled the score with a spectacular goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen put Dundee in the lead late in the second half and he scored the fifth goal for his team in the final minutes of the game.
The Giants have lost four of their last five games, now resting to wait for their next game against Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controllers sacrificed their lives to save hundreds of people on board the plane from the quake.
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia are being hailed as heroes after being sacrificed to ensure that the plane carrying hundreds of passengers can take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continued to strike the area and many people were trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Although colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the control tower, which was swaying due to strong winds at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the air traffic control tower because he thought it was collapsing.
Then he died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision saved lives, according to Australian newspaper ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he stopped breathing before the plane reached Palu.
“Our hearts were broken when we received this news,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could be in the thousands, a spokesman for the national disaster mitigation agency said, adding it was difficult to reach the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The death toll continues to rise because many bodies are still trapped under the rubble and we have not yet reached many people,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to six meters high devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military aircraft and commercial aircraft provide aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute there is an ambulance carrying the bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Small markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to support survivors but we don't know what the situation is like there.
This is a tragedy, but the situation could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: "I would like you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says one man is still missing after plane crash in Micronesia
The airline operating the crashed flight in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia said one man was missing after saying earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that, as of Saturday afternoon, we had not been able to find a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local agencies, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to hospital.
Airlines said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events have not yet been determined.
Both the U.S. Air Force and Navy said the plane landed in the sea shortly after leaving the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was missing the runway.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was at a very low altitude.
“This is a good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others could wade through waist-deep waters to reach emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said flight attendants panicked and screamed, and he suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby while repairing the wharf also helped with the rescue by using a pontoon boat to pick up those ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Data from the aviation safety net shows 111 people have died in accidents of airlines registered in the PNG network in the past two decades but there have been no incidents involving Air Niugini.
Police said the woman was found on the night she was burned alive.
The prosecution based the case on Saturday’s retrial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified in court for hours as an intelligence analyst.
He demonstrated to jurors how to use mobile recordings to compile the movements of Quinton Tellis, 21, and Jessica Chambers, 19, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from a mobile phone number that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his previous claims, the Clarion Ledger reported.
The data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambers’s during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, who police questioned.
Sanford testified in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in the town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another conflicting detail is that Tellis says he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records show they’ve only known each other for about a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and communications from his phone.
“He erased you from his life,” Hale said.
Defense attorneys are expected to begin closed-door arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected a jury trial that day.
High Breed: What is Positive Hip Hop?
The trio of hip hop artists wanted to counter the negative views of the genre by injecting positive messages into their music.
The High Breed group, from Bristol, claimed hip hop was no longer conveying political messages and addressing social issues.
The group wanted to bring the genre back to its true roots and re-populate positive hip hop music.
Recently artists such as the Fugees and Common Group have gained more fame in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Yet another black man?
NY nurse sues couple who fired her after 'racist' text message
A New York nanny Nanny has sued a couple who fired her for discrimination after she accidentally received a mistakenly sent message from her mother complaining that she was "a black person."
The couple rejected them as racists, seeing the lawsuit as a case of "blackmail."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when she discovered that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day in 2016.
“NO NO, AGAIN A OTHER BLACK SKIN,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman texted her husband.
However, instead of sending a message to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the confusion, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, who said the soon-to-be-retired African nanny had done a bad job and that she hoped to have a Filipino nanny, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid by the day and took an Uber home on her own.
Now, Ms. Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for dismissal with a compensation of $350 a day over a six-month period for the work she was hired to receive money despite not signing any contracts between them.
“I want to show them, look, you can’t do things like that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple protested the allegations that they were racists, saying it was justified to end Maurice's employment for fear that they could not trust her after having insulted her.
“My wife sent her a message she didn’t intend to send.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But can you give your child to someone you’ve offended, even by mistake?
What about the newborn?
Tell me."
In comparing the case to a “blackmail case,” Plasco said his wife had given birth to a baby two months earlier and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“How would you deal with someone like that?
This is not a good thing to do,” the investment banker added.
While the legal case was going on, the flow of public opinion quickly pointed at the couple on social media, decrying their behavior and the logic of the story.
Paddington Publishers Fear Readers Won't Be Interested In The Story Of A Talking Bear, Letter Says
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, was born shortly after the book was widely accepted, the letter revealed: "It's hard to put yourself in someone else's shoes when the book is first published.
It’s great that we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
When talking about her father, who was a cinematographer for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book from a small toy bear, she added that she felt optimistic when her work was rejected, adding that it was a "mixed joy" after his death last year.
When she spoke of Paddington, she described her as "a very important member of our family," adding that her father had always been quietly proud of his success.
“He’s a pretty quiet man, and he’s not an energetic person,” she said.
“But because Paddington really existed for him, it’s almost like you have a child and it’s a lot of success: you’re proud of them even if they don’t exist.
I think he saw Paddington's work that way.
Although it was a product of his creativity and imagination, he always won a certain position for Paddington.”
My daughter passed away and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“I call Nad often to tell her it’s bad and she shouldn’t have to,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying she was going to stop breathing for two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll see you soon.
I'll always be with you.
The doctors pumped her heart medication and slowly pulled the tube out of her body.
She stopped breathing a few times and this was the last time.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was not yet closed.
I can’t cry or scream or cry because I’m with my family and everyone else.
I have to be the one who binds them.”
Finally Ednan-Laperouse, still grieving the loss of her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers and faced the ordeal she would have to face.
"Nobody knows," she said.
“I keep my head down and cry all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but when I was on the flight I felt pity for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her.”
Woman posts postcard to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are trying to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people could call for assistance.
Davis’s son, Tyler, who was 13 at the time, suffered from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to have to be in the feeling that I have to go through every day,” she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a gritty laugh.
“Everyone knows it because of the laughter.
They used to say the boy’s laughter lit up every room.”
However, he quit his job before committing suicide because he found himself “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s younger brother, who was 11 at the time, died just like his older brother after taking his own life.
Ms Davis said: “I was constantly worried that there would be a chain reaction.”
Davis designed the cards, “to let people know that there are always people you can meet, talk to or even make friends with.
Don’t live in silence – you need to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who had been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost her partner, Mark, 15 years ago, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He wasn’t talking about feeling depressed or frustrated or anything like that,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed his attitude.
He was in a bad mood on Christmas Day when the kids opened their presents and he didn’t even notice them or anything.”
She said that the death of her husband was a huge loss for them, but they still had to try to overcome: "This has caused a huge hole in our family.
It breaks our hearts.
But we all keep living it and fighting it.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
Flake said on Saturday that "I think, if we can really get something like what he's been asking for -- a limited-time, limited-range investigation that we can collect a little bit of," adding that he feared the committees would be "trapped" in partisan wrangling.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their procrastination is only a matter of time.
The five-week midterm elections on Nov. 6 — if expected, the Republicans are in a very bad situation — will be even weaker in their efforts to find the representative they want to elect to the highest office.
George W. Bush phoned senators and lobbyists in support of Kavanaugh, who had served as a White House aide under Bush, and was able to reach out to his wife Ashley, who had been Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases the reports?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there will be 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It was not immediately clear whether Kavanaugh would receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Pence, now the vice president, to untangle and confirm his place on the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors ‘drops sharply’ under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors has plummeted since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a lawmaker in South Korea has said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, said there were 1,127 defections last year — up from 2,706 defections in 2011.
Park said the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the large percentage of smugglers being apprehended were key factors in the change.
North Korea has not made public comments.
Most defectors from North Korea were eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most defectors flee through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea, and they can easily cross the heavily fortified demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two countries.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to repatriate.
Relations between North and South Korea – technically still in a state of war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on denuclearization.
The moves follow a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where both sides agreed to extended terms for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-Ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the delay in progress.
“If there is no trust on the American side, then there will be no trust on our national security issue and in such a case, there is no other way that we will unilaterally find our own disarmament,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a “radical” and said he was unfit for a position on the Supreme Court.
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a “radical element” and said he is temporarily unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview that took place Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman ever did that then they would call it ‘radicals,’” Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both minors.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh expressed a lot of emotion, at times almost exclamations and chokes when talking about his family and five months of high school.
He also strongly denounced Democrats before the committee, calling the charges against him a “well-planned assassination” out of anger over Hillary Clinton’s loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh’s testimony proved he was unfit for the Supreme Court seat, as he clearly demonstrated behavior against the Democratic Party.
“I think you have removed yourself from your position when it comes to your statements and your treatment when it comes to the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi declined when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats won a majority in the House.
“I would say this — if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only is he not in the Supreme Court, but he’s going to have to testify in court,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeals in D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s ability to make a ruling against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
During the hearing, Kavanaugh dodged the question of whether he would change some Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a radical, biased person to take a position in court and hope we will say, 'Isn't this great,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to take advantage.
This was indeed a heavy criticism, month after month, year after year, and she couldn’t get over it without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” Ms. Steinem told me after 45 years.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do you?”
She continued, "I was helped a lot by a woman, she was a senior executive, she said she also cried when she was angry but to form a reaction when she was angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was just talking to that, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And you continue to cry.
And I think that's great."
You are allowed to cry so this behavior is part of the way out for the rage because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my deepest memories of working at my first company was that as a man-only place, I used to cry when there was an outburst of anger, and that was when an older woman—who was the cold manager that always scared me—pushed me up the stairs.
She told me, “Don’t ever let them see you cry.”
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and happy that they’re with you.”
Patricia Schroeder, later a Democratic congresswoman in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, Schroeder was deeply disappointed, saying there was no reason why she could not run for president herself.
Thirty years later she smiled and told me, “That wasn’t a wise decision.”
“There have been seven other candidates in the race, and they need one more candidate.
Someone called this race "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Due to her late participation in the campaign, she lost the campaign, so she vowed not to run unless she raised $2 million.
The war has failed.
She found that some supporters gave her US$250 instead of US$1,000 in favor of the male candidate.
She asked herself, “Do they think I’m undervalued?”
When she announced that she would not launch an official campaign, she got over the emotion – expressing gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise funds and targeting voters rather than delegates, she was angry at being sexist – that she choked up.
“You might think I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled of how the press reacted to her.
“You thought Kleenex was a sponsor of my company.
I remember thinking about what they would put on my gravestone.
'Are you crying?'
US-China trade war could be a good sign for Beijing
Experts said that the opening of the trade war between the United States and China has stalled, and the war will be long, the rift between the countries may be an advantage for Beijing.
Earlier this year, Donald Trump, the US president, issued his first warning by levying tariffs on key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
Escalation has been on the rise in recent weeks with tariffs worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) hitting half of Chinese goods imported into the US.
Beijing has retaliated by raising tariffs by five to ten percent to $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to retaliate in proportion to the actions of the United States and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to be shaken soon.
Getting Washington to make concessions means Beijing has to make demands, but publicly succumbing to the United States is too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing can get the moves right, in the long run the pressure of a trade war with the United States could be a positive signal to China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The reality is that a political decision in Washington or in Beijing can both start an economic relationship in either country and this is actually far more dangerous than previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused think tank at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the national situation is more stable and safer because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
Government continues to renovate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore living conditions
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees who have left the country because of terrorism and economic conditions that affect their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that the nation would not accept conditional aid or help from the countries that financed the uprising.
Europe to win Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup beating the United States 16.5-10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The US has lost six times in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the championship when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn got 14.5 points when beating the US team.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who has competed in most tournaments, threw his tee shot into the water at the third tee on the 16th hole, admitting he had lost to Francesco Molinari.
Molinari shines through every round and is one of four players to have won 5-0-0 since the current season began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5 & 4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world’s top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England’s Ian Poulter, who could have played the last Ryder Cup game of his career.
A veteran player of eight Ryder Cup seasons, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the greatest champion of all tournaments with a total score of 25.5.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t stop it today.
It’s really been a tough year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I was so happy to get the cup.
On my team, I’m delighted that I was able to help,” Garcia said of the emotion following Europe’s win.
He passed the torch to compatriot John Ram, the golfer who defeated legendary American Tiger Woods 2-1 in a singles match on Sunday.
“It’s such a pride to be able to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up admiring him,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four matches in France and currently has a record 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup tournaments.
Statistics of one of the greatest players of all time show that he has won 14 major trophies and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team did its best to find tickets for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who were first highly qualified golfers of the tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the players, they fought so well.
This morning we had difficulties due to the high temperatures in Europe.
We're out.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He is an excellent captain.
All 12 players in the team played very well.
We’re going to regroup, I’m going to play the PGA in the U.S. and the Ryder Cup and we’re going to continue to be top of the group.
I love all 12 players and I am proud to be captain.
I take off my hat, my friends.
We played very well.”
Update on Red Tide: Red Tide Density Decreased in Pinellas, Manatee, and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Association shows that the density of the Red Tide has decreased in much of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, algal blooms have been reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties – which causes the red tide density to drop.
The Red Tide phenomenon spreads for about 130 miles along the coast north of Pinellas to the south of Lee County.
Small patches have also been found within 10 miles of Hillsborough County, but fewer sites than last week.
Red tides have also been observed in Pasco County.
Average coastal or offshore density of Pinellas County has been reported in the past week, low-to-high offshore density of Hillsborough County, low-to-high offshore density of Manatee County, low-to-high offshore density of Sarasota County, low-to-high density of Charlotte County, low-to-high coastal or offshore density of Lee County, and low-to-high offshore density of Collier County.
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
Respiratory irritation has not been reported in northwestern Florida over the past week.
