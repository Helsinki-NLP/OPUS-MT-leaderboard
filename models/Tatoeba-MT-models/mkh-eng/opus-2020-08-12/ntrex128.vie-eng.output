Peoples of Wales (AM) were concerned about ‘ being as confused as those who were. ’
There is a certain concern of certain Congress delegates involved in changing their title to MWP.
The problem arose by planning to change the country name into Wales Senate.
The delegates on the Kingdom Hall were concerned that this could be a problem raised from the left.
A Lao party said that his party was concerned that "the word would spell with Twp and Pwp."
For readers not native Wales: In Wales, twp means temporary and pwp means shit.
A party representative points out that the whole party is not proud and proposes other names.
And one of the Republicans who shared his party was "no prejudice" about changing names, but he didn't forget to mention how to write off MWP easily turned into Muppet.
In the same way as the Walesn w is spoken in the same way as the u word of New Yorkshire.
The Congress Committee is now preparing a bill of rename, saying, "The blood is final about any of the Congress's names, of course, will certainly be the concern of the delegates."
Wales government rule in 2017 gave the Wales State his own name.
In June, the committee published the result of a popular demand for suggestions to search for a approved basis for the Congress calling the Wales Hospital.
According to the attendance story of the Congress, the Israelal Committee of Senator Wales or WMP, but the result of the bridge indicates that there's an equality on the Senator of Wales.
Congress delegates are publicly giving other solutions, but the effort to achieve unity may be a concern for the election minister, Elin Jones, who has been assigned to the bill of discipline in the next few weeks.
The bill of discipline will include other changes in how the Congress is running, including laws that were how the Congress of Congress and designed the government.
The delegates will give final votes for the question what should be changed when they are interested in the billing bill.
The Macedonias vote in the national requirements for changing the country's name
The votes for Sunday votes about whether they changed their country's names into the Northern Macedonia Peace.
The full vote was set up in an effort to resolve the struggle for decades with Greek neighbors, where there was also a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of the neighboring country corresponds to its own territory and has repeatedly opposed being a member of the EU and NATO of your country.
President Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, a member of the counter-inductal team, declared that the vote would be canceled.
However, those who support the popular calling of the people, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, think that changing the signal is the cost to enter EU and NATO.

"In the historical way, the elders whom I was contacted shared that every corner of the street had a bar and a church," said Adams.
"To this day, there is no church without a bar."
He saw that the disappearing of the bars was something that could be accepted.
He said, "The Son of Man has many ways to communicate."
"The bars are no longer public living rooms where people come back from often."
As for churches, he was concerned that money from selling property won't be as strong as the leaders expected, "and sooner or sooner or later, they will all come back at the starting point."
He added, these churches could be replaced by buildings associated with many local buildings, which would not help to preserve the respect of local authorities.
He said, "A small part of the people who buy apartments in these apartments will be white people, and then the prospect of closed churches will come faster than ever, because there's no reason for the residents in those apartments to become teachers here."
Both churches were built by white religions before Kretto became a city for black - Metropolis Republic in the 1870 ’ s, became St. Martin's a decade later.
The first white teachings of Christendom moved in the 1930 ’ s.
A well - known black flock of Jehovah’s Witnesses in nearby lands has taken over its location.
St. Martin's been served by a colored class under the oversight of John Howard Johnson, the head of a sale on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who was opposed to renting or encouraging colored people.
A fire in 1939 broke down the building, but when Cha Johnson’s people planned to rebuild it, they set up bells.
Professor David Johnson, the son of Cha Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell bell "The bell of the poor."
"A cultural museum museum" and "a non-intained historical treasure."
Well, the experts of the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the world's first bell bells played by a colored musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had been chasing the greater bells at Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriam said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What happened at St. Martin's over the past few months was a complicated story of architecture and contractors, some of which were made by church leaders, other issues, by the New Catholic Church.
The Catholic authorities, including the religious leaders of the religion, referred to the doctrine of Rome in July with concerns that religion, "will seek to deliver expenses" for the minister, although they are not involved in renting architectures and engineers mentioned.
Some religions are not pleased with the unsatisfyingness of their religion.

The suicide strategy into the beauty market of Sains House 's Kingdom.
Sins House's pushing the Boots, Superdrung and Debenhams with traditional ways of doing things, where there are always helpers.
It's part of a huge push on the market that's worth 2,8 billion pounds in English, where it's going to continue to grow as the fashion industry and the tools go down, much bigger and better things are going to be tested at 9 billion countries around the country, and then you're able to multiply the tissue in many more new stores in the next year if there's any sign of interest.
An investment in good business appears when the markets look for ways to use the store instead of TV store, the breadmills, and the tools.
Sinsbury's said the first time they doubled their beautiful product to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Available brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Sterve's Bees will also have extra space as well as similar branding areas as showing in store like at Boots.
Superstitions are also increasing the flow of their Boutnique makeup to most of the products that are just plants -- which are getting more and more and more young people hunting.
In addition, the Fagrance Shop perfumer will try to test the price at two Sains House's, the first store opened at Croydon, south of London, the second week before the second week at Selly Oak, Birmingham, at the end of the year.
Network shopping and switching to buy a small amount of food every day at local transportation store, which means that the store had to drive more blood in order to attract customers.
Mike Corepe, the director of Sainsto's CEO's, said that the store would be much more like the stock store when the store was trying to deal with the favors from Aldi and Lidl with more services and less food.
It also introduced some of Hineatats' stores since they bought both brands of brand two years ago, which moved the stock trades and made it more productive.
Superstitions have tried to improve their beauty and herbs but failed.
Sins House's experimented with Boots at the beginning of the year 2000, but cooperation ended after there was a problem with how to divide the product from the good stuff in the market.
The new strategy was made after Sains House's sold 281 of his medicines for Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds string, at the price of 125 million pounds in three years ago.
Knowing that Lloyds is going to contribute a part of the plan, by increasing a bunch of remote skin care brands including La Ro Ro Rochee-Nitay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the CEO of Sins House's sharing, "We've changed our appearance and feelings to improve our environment for our clients.
We also invested in special training for the staff, who would directly provide counsel.
Our brands are designed to match all sorts of needs and attractive environments as well as places that are convenient to us now are an attractive stop point, challenge the traditional shopping process."
Peter Jones ‘ left his wrath ’ after Holly Willoughby pulled out of his contract of 11 million pounds.
Dragons Den' star, Peter Jones, has been "discreet" after the recipient of Holly Willoughby's television taking out of his 11 million contracts in business of her style to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for its furniture brands and their Truly entities.
The business of the couple is likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This 37-year-old program on Instagram to inform you that you're leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den, causing the star Peter Jones to be angry when she withdrew from its super profit business activity at the end of her last minute -- to focus on her own new fat contracts with Marks & Spencer; and ITV.
In a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, sources say that Jones had been angry when the golden girl of the program acknowledged that her new contracts were worth 1,000 pounds of pounds of pounds -- which means she had no time to give attention to their furniture and to their Truly charges.
Business is compared to Gwp of Gwyneth Paltrow and is assumed to double the 11 million pounds of Willoughby.
When Willoughby was 37 years old, went up to Instagram to announce that she was going to leave Truly, Jones quickly left England to go to one of his vacation houses.
One source says, "I am now, Truly is Holly's top priority.
That was supposed to be her long future that might be with you for the next few decades.
Her decision to leave made very amazing people involved.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, which is very close to the moment of birth.
There's a store full of goods at the Marlow headquarters ready to blow up."
Experts believe that the departure of this program is one of the most birth stars in England, which can make the company pay millions of dollars by investing their hands on products from beds and candles to clothes and furniture, and the ability to reverse the point of producing products.
And that could be the end of a lasting friendship.
Willoughby’s parents became close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby had founded Toruly with Capp in 2016, Jones, 52 years old, as president in March.
The couples were traveling together, and Jones had 40 percent of his share in the television production company.
Willoughby will become an ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin to become the leader of ITV as I'm Aelebrity.
A close source with Jones sharing last night saying, "We're not going to comment on his business."
“ Love each other deeply, ” said a deep love for each other.
He spoke of the criticism he would receive from the media because he gave a comment that some would consider "no human being" for having seen the possibility of taking the lead in Korea.
Why did President Horton give up so much?
"The director of the program."
"I didn't give up anything."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June when he praised this as a big step in nuclearization in Korea.
But nuclear negotiations have been compromised.
More than three months after the convention of June of July in Singapore, the head of South Korea sent out to the world leaders of the United States at the U.S.A. at the Seventh convention, that North Korea didn't notice "Acture response" from the United States to the motives of the first armed leader of North Korea.
Instead, he claimed that the United States is continuing to execute punishments in order to increase pressure.
Mr. Whistler had a more optimistic view of his speech at his campaign.
"We're doing great for Korea," he said.
"We're going to fight Korea.
Millions of people may be killed.
Now we're in this fine relationship."
He said that efforts to improve his relationship with Kim brought positive results — the outcome of rocket testing, helping him to be free and to get his bones back to his home.
And he protected his unusual approach when he spoke about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to become president, but instead of 10,000 outsiders trying to put our feet in this tight zone, we have about 200 people standing right there," said Mr. Whirtling, toward the crowd in front of us.
The Earth and the Mediterranean in Indonesia destroyed the island and killed the Dead Manuan.
For example, after disaster from Lombok earthquake, foreign NGO organizations indicate that they do not need to be there.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population have been missing, there is no statement about the national disaster that has been given, which is a key to the international assistance.
" Unfortunately, in many cases, they've been very strict in not asking international aid, so it's very challenging." Mrs. Sumbong shared.
While saving the Children's team is gathering a group to move to Palu, they're not sure whether foreign employees can work in this area or not.
Mr. Sutopo, who spoke of national disaster agency, said that Indonesia officials are measure up to the situation in Palu to see if international institutions are allowed to contribute aid efforts.
Despite the constant earthquakes that Indonesia experienced, this nation is still not well prepared for the rage of nature.
While the tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, such places were not common in other locations.
Though effective warnings were needed, lack of miraculous warnings in Palu were able to lead people to harm.
At times, traveling between the islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Inflammation takes even more complicated.
An ambulance ship has returned in Lombok to treat the earthquake victims who are looking for their way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach where the disaster just happened.
President Joko Widodod has made an effort to improve Indonesia's old infrastructure into a center of his election campaign, and he has wasted his expenses on building sugar and iron.
But financial loss has made it difficult for Joko’s government to cope with the next year's election.
Joko is also facing pressures from the pressures that have not yet ended in Indonesia, when members of the majority of Muslims pursue a more reliable form of defense than they are.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were removed from their homes when the pagan gangs and Islams fell on the streets, using swords, bows, and other primitive weapons.

Congress Cromwell's icon became the latest anniversary of the story of history.
The resolution would be like justice in the matter of a great destruction of many religious priests who followed him, when they destroyed the vast number of British architecture and religious buildings.
But Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's words as "discrect" and "the force of writing history."
John Goldsmith, President Cromwell, says: "It's impossible to avoid arguments about leaving the characters Oliver Cromwell outside of Westminster will become the present point.
The icons of civil wars in England were not ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell wrongs would have been replaced by the actions of the father Thomas of his father in the past century.
Mr. Cromwell, Mr. William Hamo Thassycroft is evidence of the 19th century opinion and is part of the history of a character that many believe is still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith shares with the Sundayorg University: Mr. Goldsmith says to the Sunday Stanford University: "It's probably far more than the end of the 19th century now, Cromwell is considered to be the one who's considered to protect the State against the external pressure, in his mind, it's certainly a financial leader.
Even if it's an accurate definition for the theme in the historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict between the 17th century has determined the next development of our country and Cromwell is a typical character in division.
His accomplishments as a defender are worthy of honor and credit."

Rosa will bring up ten inches high in Mexico on Monday.
Then the low pressure is going to cause huge rainfalls in the South during the coming days.
In the local, the amount of rain from 1 to 4 inches will cause dangerous scans, fragments, and possibilities of flooding in the desert.
The temperature will cause the amount of rain to two to three inches per hour at the points, especially in the South Nevada and Arizona regions.
There are two to four inches south, especially on Arizona's broad scale.
What can happen when bad things are going quickly because of the corrupt nature of tropical rain.

More than 20 million people are watching the hearing of Kovanaugh.
More than 20 million people have been watching the hearing on the fifth day on six TV systems of Supreme Court candidate Kovanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual attack that was supposed to happen in the 1980s, Christine Blas Ford.
Meanwhile, the political switch continued, with the radio that interfered with regular radio transmissions with the final stroke on Friday: a deal was made by Senator Arizona Jeffing to run the FBI for a week on charges.
Ford told the Senate committee that she was surely 100% drunk Kovanaugh and tried to remove her clothes at a high school party.
Kavalaugh, in calm motion, says he's 100% sure that it doesn't happen.
It's possible that more than 20,4 million people were watching the hearing, according to Nielsen in the report on Friday.
The company has calculated the average number of watchers on ABC, CBS, NBC, CN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data doesn't even include for other television stations, including PBS, C-N and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often encounter some problems when calculating those who see in his office.
To establish a relationship, the audience's population is similar to that for a final ticket or an Oscar prize.
Fox Newss, who showed a powerful support program to appoint Kavanaugh, took the lead at the average rate of 5,9 million people who saw in the hearing all day, Nielsen shared.
ABC is second with 3,26 million viewers.
CS with 3,1 million, NBC 2, 260 million, MSNBC 2,89 million, and CNNN is 2,52 million, Nielsen.
The concern is still very big after the hearing.
Flake is the central character in the noise Friday.
After the Republic's Republican character had made a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was watched by CNN and CBS on Friday morning that he was shouted when he tried to move the elevator to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
He stood down with his eyes in a few minutes when he was questioned, on television on CN.
"I am standing before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he said the truth to the nation?"
He was condemned, "You have power while too many women are incompetent."
Flake said before the elevator closed that his office gave a statement that he would have much to say at the hearing of the committee's hearing.
All cable TV and television stations are covered for hours directly after that, when the Justice Committee will have to vote for Mr. Zhun Kovanaugh's appointment.
But Flake said that he would only do this when he knew that the FBI would consider charges against the candidate next week, which some of the minor democracy had urged.
Flake was convinced of his conversations with his partner, Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and some senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice is heavy, because it is clear that the Republicans will not have Kavanaugh web vote without any investigation.
President C.E. has opened an FBI investigation of charges against Kovanaugh.

Menga's shot brought 1-0 to Livingston before the fears
Dolly Menga's previous guide helps Livingston to win the victory
Livingston is leading up to surprises when this Ibrox team is led by Steven Gerrard with only two losers in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's desk showed a difference when Gary Hulk's side lifted up his reach to Hibernian in just a few seconds.
Gerrard's team hasn't got no specific table on this season and facing Hearts oil leaders, leading before eight points, on Sundays.
Before that, the percent welcomes Rapid Vienna in Euro League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston, has extended his infestible battle in six games, when the director of Clifford tastes failed since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed the chance to compete with the client beneath
Holt's team should have led before they wrote the table, with their direct strategy that would have been difficult.
Hey, Mr. Scottins full but past the target, then Alan Lithgow can only direct his efforts more powerful than then lead the ball to Craig Halkett across the bridge.
The self-importors were confident to play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble for their guests with personal techniques.
And that's the strategy for the specified score.
Composes created a double kick and Livingston led ahead, Declan Gallagher, and attituded towards Menga, who had played ball and scored the point in the middle of the bridge.
At this point, Scaras took advantage of the ball, but found that the defenses couldn't break through and that the players at the time had almost no trouble,
The next game went on to the second round, although Alfredo Morelos received help from Kelly.
Scott Pitman has failed under the legs of his players as the catalyst of the Andesszor and Lithgow to another role play of Livingston.
The balls kept on the field of Livingston and were constantly sealed, when there were two temples after the challenge of Halkttt for the successors of faith, one because they touched the ball - they were all stopped.
' Label 'with Livingston - Analysis
From Alasdair Lamont Scotland at Tony Macaroni School
It's a result and the games are filled with names for Livingston.
The team is excellent, continuing to reach out for the end of the stream.
Their games and players have rarely changed since they came back to their heads, but the state is significant for Pilly because the way he sharpened the team since he showed up.
You have too many powerful players.
Captain Halkett is a universal person who organizes an excellent defense, whereas Menga continues to keep Connor Goldson's feet and Joe Worralll.
But it's a lot of inspiration.
As they were under Gerrard’s era, they did not achieve those standards.
At the end of the last drop -- the only chance of opening up the host field -- and it's a wake-up warning for the Kants, the team responds in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a lot of theme welcome at the Colagne

It was the last day of President Erdogan's debate on Germany--to heal relationships between the NATO allies.

This city is the largest Turkey population outside Turkey.
The police led security reasons to prevent the 25,000 crowd from being gathered before the mosques, but a lot of backing were also nearby to meet their president.
Hundreds of people protested Erdogan - many of them were Kurrd - speaking, also condemned Erdogan's policy and decided to send him to this country.
The two extreme demonstrations reflect the division of a guest praised as a hero of some Turkishs in Germany and cursed by others as an authority.

Rosal Rosa was wearing the 12th century, Las Vegas City, Salt Lake City with the Red Sea Reaper (The Great Sea).
It's very rare, very difficult, very low tropical pressure hit Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen next week when the energy of Rosa storms in the desert of South West is still at the risk of the scans.
The National icon has been published watching the scans on Mondays and Tuesdays for West Arizona to South Arizona and East Nevada, East California and Utah, including the city of Phoenix, Figtaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake.
Rosa storm expected to follow a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, but before the Monday night there was raining rain.
The National icon in Phoenix mentioned in one news report that only "The tropical storms have produced a tropical storm or a tropical storm within 200 miles [200 km] of rain - heat!
Groves (1666) is a storm within 40 miles of activity into the Arizona border."
The latest predictor models from the United Kingdom Center predicting the height of rain in about two to 4 inches, with the distance of floods apart to 6 inches [6 inches] at the Mogollon coast in Arizona.
Other parts of the Western desert, including the central Rockies Center, and the Great Lands, may be scattered from one to two inches to two inches, with the distance of separation can go up to four inches.
With unsolved areas, the rain from Rosa storms may be a good sign because the region is under ban.
While flooding is a deep concern, some waterfalls may still be happy to welcome because the Southeas are under severe circumstances.
According to weather.com, the U.S. Post says that there are only 40 percent of Arizona region under the lowest drought, but still the second in the same class.
First of all, Rosa Street went through to leave the land across the coast of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa is still at a storm at the maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, about 300 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico 385 miles away, and is traveling north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm must be colder sealines in the Pacific and then weaken.
The report therefore shows that there will be land in Mexico when the tropical pressure passes by Monday evening.
The rain falls on areas in Mexico that can be significant, not as small as possible.
According to Weather.com, reporting "the amount of rain count from 3 to 6 inches to 6 inches from Baja California to north of Sonora, can go up to 10 inches."
Rosa will head north of Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early on the third day in the rainy desert, which will then sweep over Arizona and pour into South Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger of predicting from Rosa or the total loss of it is that much rain in Baja California, North Sonora and the West West West West West West West West of America," the National Center says.
These foretold rains will cause floods and floods of waters that endanger life in deserts and deserts of the region of the mountains.

Hundreds of people died by earthquakes, tsunamis in Indonesia, increasing damage.
At least 384 people lost their lives, many were drifted away when giant waves hit the beach, when a great earthquake and tsunami fell into Indonesia's island, the authorities said that it was Saturday.
Hundreds of people have gathered during a festival on the beach in Palu City on Friday when waves high to six feet tall (18 feet) came to the shore at sunset, scanning for many people to die and destroy everything on their way.
The gods followed a severe earthquake at 7,5 degrees.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still engaged in their activities on the beach and did not leave immediately and they became victims," said Sutopo Pur Puro Puro Negroho, spoken from the National Anti-NPBB, sharing in a news report in Jatta.
"The tsunami doesn't make itself determined, it pulled through cars, wood, houses, sweeps through everything on the ground," said Nugroho, and adds that the tsunami went across the sea as far as 800 kph (497 miles per hour) before entering the coast.
Some climbed onto the tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 were evacuated to 24 central in Palu.
These pictures from the sky were published by the disaster agency showing that many buildings and stores were destroyed, bridges were broken and broken and collapsed and a Muslim church had been flooded in the water.
The seizures continued to shake the coast city in Saturday.
A series of earthquakes has been discovered in a region with 2,4 million people.
Indonesia’s Art Service Service Service Service Service School says that in the release of the energy in the energy release by a strong earthquake Friday, about 200 times the energy of nuclear bombs fell into Hiroshima City in the second world war.
The location of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, as indicated.
Mr. Nugroho described the damage as "greatto" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels have fallen.
The body of some victims was found trapped under the ruins of broken buildings, and he reported, there were 540 more wounded and 29 missing.
Nugroho says that damage and damage may not have stopped along the coast of 300 miles (190 km) north of Palu, a region called Donggala, near the heart of the earthquake.
"Abstinence of any news" from Donggala, Mr. Nugroho said.
There are over 8,000 people living there," says the Red Cross in a declaration, and at the same time, it says that their employees and volunteers are reaching the affected areas.
"This has been a tragedy, but tragedy can become much more scary," they said.
This Saturday authorities were publicly condemned because they did not announce that the tsunami struck Palu, even though the officials said that the wave had arrived in time of warning.
In a non-violent video published on the social network, it shows that it can be heard of a man standing up above who's shouting panicd for those who were down the way about the tsunami coming.
A few minutes later, a wall of water came into the shore, scanning through buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't be verified at the video.
The earthquake and tsunamis caused massive loss of electricity damage to the communication around Palu that caused the government to struggle in cooperation with rescue efforts.
The authorities said that the army had begun to cut the cargo planes with help from Jagarita and other cities, but the exiles were still in need of food and other basic needs.
The city airport has been opened again for relief efforts and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will be planning to visit people who are evacuated in Palu on Sunday.
The real number of people in Indonesia are more than 800.
It's bad.
While the members of the World Vision came from Donggala City safely arrived in the city of Palu, where the employees were in the houses built in the office, they went through the scenes that destroyed the streets, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's a bad situation.
Even when relief groups began to take on significant actions when they began disaster relief tools, some complain that foreign relief workers with advanced professionals were prevented from moving to Palu.
Indonesia’s requirements, finance, private and foreign kindness can only begin if the disaster is declared as a national disaster zone.
That's not happening yet.
"This is still a wake-up disaster," said Aulia Arani, the speech of the Red Cross.
" Once the government decided, "Yes, this is a national disaster," then we were able to be ready for international assistance but no voices."
When the second night goes down to Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and families of those who are still missing hope that their loved ones will be the miracle of collecting the dark stories of natural disasters.

"I'm friends, I'm us, it's us.
The transition from Kanye, which means only, to Ye--the reflection of good, bad, what comes back, everything.
The album is more than our own reflection.

The United States should double the A.I.
When the Chinese become more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the cost of research in this area, investors and professionals on Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The ideas were made after different parts of the U.S. government have issued an announcement about AI, even while the entire United States is missing an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced his plans last year: The goal of becoming the leader of the nation of AI innovation until 2030.
"The double of the AI budget will be a positive beginning, because all the other countries will fall behind the United States very far, and we're looking for the next break in AI," said Lee.
Double the cost double the cost could double the chance that the next huge AI success would be done in the United States, Lee shared with CNBC in a interview this week.
Lee, author of the book Human Human intelligence: China, the Valley of Silicon and the New World Order" was published in this month by Houghton Miffin Harcourt, Director of Sinotures, invested in one of the most prominent Chinese AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked in an AI system that defeated OEA players in America with the highest class, then he was the director at Microsoft Research and the Google branch director in China.
Lee approached previous industrial contests of the U.S. government, such as testing the robot of the KSCJ research Research Research Department, and cares when the next contest will take place, in order to help determine the next vision.
Researchers in the United States often work hard to obtain government aid, Lee shared.
"Not China is calling all scholars first; it's companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired light stars from colleges to work on AI in recent years.
Lee shared the changes in foreign policy can also help the United States to strengthen their relationships with AI.
He said, "I think the green card should be automatically given to Dr. AI."
The Chinese hospital has conducted the next generation's artificial mental development plan in July 2017.
Lee adds: The National National Science Institute for Human Rights provides aid for those who are part of similar scientific institutions in the same way as the Society and other government organizations provide money for American researchers, but the quality of their research in China is lower.
Early this year in the United States of the United States of the United States of America, the United States of America has established a nuclear Center for Human Rights, to interfere with cooperation from industry and education, and the White House has established a artificial selection of human wisdom.
In this month, the U.S. Department of Research Research Institutes forwarded to four billion dollars for a project called AI Next.
At the National Science Institute, they now invest in over 100 million dollars a year on AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. law has been looking for a National Security Council for human intelligence but has not yet seen a move for many months.
The Macedonias vote in the national requirements for changing the country's name
The Macedonias have voted on Sunday demand about having changed into "The Northern Macedonia" or not, this is an act of handle for decades with Greece to prevent the integration of the European Union and NATO alliance.
Greece, Greece, has a province called Macednonia, claiming that the name of the neighbor north is relative to his own territory and that he has decided to participate in NATO and EU.
The two governments signed a deal in June based on the name of the new name, but people who opposed the civilism claimed that this change would weaken the nation of most peoples in Macedonia.
The President Gjorge Ivanov declared that he would not vote in the demand and that a meat cleansing operation had developed a doubt about whether or not an election would meet at least 50% for the legality of the public requirements.
The question on this vote is that people would have the content: "Do you agree to become a NATATO and EU with the agreement with Greece."
Those who supported the rename, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claimed that it was a price to pursue such organizations as EU and Macediana's NATO, one of the countries that came from the fall of Persia.
"I'm here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macediania so that they can freely enjoy the support of the European Union, because that's why I'm headed to a safer life for all of us."
While members of the Congress are not legally bound, they say they're going to take the votes to make decisions.
Changing the name will take two thirds of the votes in the Congress.
The national election committee said there was no mention of any unusualness until 1:00 p.m.
However, the vote was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the election last year when 66 percent votes for votes.
The tri Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old in Sputje capital, shared: "I vote for my children, because our position is in Europe."
The prime minister of Macednonia, Zoran Zaev, Mrs. Zorica, his wife, Dshko, and his son Dshko, have chosen to vote in the national requirements of changing the country's name, which will open the way for NAATO and the European Union at Strumica, Macedonia in September 3018.
Before the convention in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small platform and pulled chairs before the tent built by people who were going to wipe out the demand.
Kavadarkov said, "We support NATO and EU, but we want to join in the main way, not through the back door."
"We are a poor nation, but poor for clean.
If they don't think we're Macednonia, then we can move into other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Asia-Roldo bond."
Prime Minister Zaev says that as a NATO member, it will bring great investments for Macedonia, where there are a lost rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that most would agree because more than 80 percent of our citizens support EU and NATO," said Zaev after vote.
He shared that the result of a yes would be "the precept" for our future."
A poll published on Monday last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute Research Institute stated that about 30 to 43 percent of the votes would be involved in the national requirements -- less than the vote level.
Another survey, done by Telma TV from Macediania, said that 57 percent of those who were asked had a vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said that they made a deal.
A successful citizen has to have a vote rate of 50 percent and a vote.
Failure in the public display showed that the first serious hit was with the policy of the Western government since its last May.

Scherzer wants to burn all the way back to Rockies
With the Nationals being removed from the final tickets, there's no reason to start over.
But the Scherzer was eager to win a Sunday competition with Colorado Rockies, but this still only meant when he was still fighting for Rockies, who led a battle with Los Angeles Dodgers in West Power.

The Controvers in West Virginia
The President mentioned details of the situation around his Supreme Court, choosing Kovanaugh when speaking about the importance of vote for the Republicans during the midterms.
"All we've done is have potential in November 11.
Only five weeks is one of the most important elections in life.
This is one of the big, big things -- no running, but running is the reason I'm going all over the struggle for the price candidate." He shared.
"You'll see the negative, negative democracy exist right now.
And they're determined to restore power by using any trick, and then you're going to see selfishness, the player.
They don't care who's hurt, who must step against to gain power and control, they just want to get power and control, and we won't give it to them."
He added, "The Democratic Party is trying to "suppose and interfere."
"You've seen it for the last four days." He adds, and he says, "and says that the Democratic Party is "I'm angry and selfish and arrogant and deceiver and lies."
He pointed out that the House Committee of the Senate has agreed to Senator Diane Feinstein, which had been stumbling from below.
"Do you remember her answer?
Do you let the information go?
What?
No, no, no, no, I was expecting -- that's a kind of good body language -- but it's exactly the worst body language I've ever seen before.
The labor party is no longer an open party.
The idea is that something impossible is unacceptable.
I'm not surprised that Kirtutum's activities, in my local party vote to check on me.
After all, I am the latest of a series of ethans who are informed that I am not welcome because I'm here to say yes.
As a member of the United States with me, Joan Ryan received a similar treat because she was determined to support opposition.
In my case, my view of browsing was on me because I did not agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of an economic policy, about national security, in Europe, similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with earlier leaders.
Nottingham East on Friday said, "We want these meetings involved and effective."
For almost eight years as senators for the local Lao party, the sixth party meetings took place that way.
Sadly, today, that is not the voice in many meetings and promises about politics "Actuous, gentleer" has been forgotten for a long time and is indeed whether it's ever started."
It is increasingly evident that different views are not considered within the Lao party, and all opinions are considered to be a matter of whether the heads of the party are accepted or not.
This started as soon as Jeremy became leader, because my former colleagues thought that my political views had begun to expect me to change my mind and take the position that I would never accept -- whether it was about national security or an EU interface.
Whenever I make public statement -- and really, whatever I say -- follow the abuse of social media, call off, the political charge, tell me that I shouldn't be part of the Lao party.
And not only do I feel that way.
Yes, I know I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues because comments point me into political trends.
I was surprised at the professionality and determination of my colleagues, who faced the flow with sexual abuse or racial differences every day but never walked away.
One of the sadest aspects of this political era is the abuse level of abuse that has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Lao party should hold a culture of mercy.
In fact, we're no longer that extended party anymore and with all "unexplicual" or a change of choice, the party has become narrow.
I've had a lot of advice for the last two years about encouraging me to stay calm, don't be too much words and then I'll be just fine.
But I'm not in politics.
Since I've been in the Lao for 32 years before I was just a boy, I was motivated by the rejection of the government of Thatcher government, which caused my entire school to collapse literally, I've tried to bring better public services to those who need them -- whether it's local or government secretary.
I've never covered my political views, even at the recent election.
No one in Nottingham East could be misconceptiond about your policy and my differences with the present leadership.
For those who moved on Friday, all I wanted to share was that when the country in Brexit, it would hurt our families, business, and public services, I didn't want to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the Society's organization.
But in fact, a message outside of Nottingham Hinham Mutum, which I served, sent to my elections, whether it's a move member of the Society or not: I'm proud to serve, and I promise, there's no threat to remove or any political way that keeps me from doing what I believe is the greatest good for you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr cannot lead
The next two tries may have violated the final outcome, but no doubt, Ayr deserves victory in the Tennent Premierishes of this label on the day.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only crown in ten teams.
In what way, it's also their super-class defenses, as well as more opportunities for them, bringing their host name and training Peter Murchie to be totally pleasing.
He shared: "To this day, we have walked through our battles until now, and we are still incompetent, so I am satisfied."
Rob Christie of Melrose said: "Ghi accepts for Ayr, they seize better opportunities than we do."
The 14th minute examination of Grant Anderson's 14th minute, given by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr to lead first, but, a gold card for the Captain Scotland Rorys, opened the game for Warriors, allowing Melrose to display his skills and Jason Baggot set a ball to the bridge.
Climo had reached ahead of Ayr with a temple payment, before that, right in the first round, he recorded a table and then scored it with an extra score of a solo increase up 17-5 to Ayr before rest.
But Melrose has begun to gather two things in a more favorable way, and Patrick Kennedy has set up, Baggot points, reducing the rate down to five points.
After a long period of serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had been down, and since its start, Ayr led ahead by Stafford McDowall's work, Climo scored further points.
Captain Ayr, Moses Macphonson, then got a gold card, and once again, Melrose made the player cut by a single shot of Bruce Colvine's side, in front of a stress pressure.
However, the host's back, and when Struan Hychonson was hit by a gold card because of his opposition to Climo without a ball, from the bid line, MacPhson made his point on the support of the Ayr team.
Climo scored further points, as he did almost since he got back, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's ball and passed to the winger Gregor Henry after giving the fifth score of his host.

‘ The sea is ours, ’ says the Bible, ‘ and the sea is ours: the country that does not have the coast of Bolivia, hoping the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors patroled a Navy headquarters equipped in La Paz.
Public buildings hang the green flag.
The Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are all painted with a saying: "It's our right.
The sea is our mission."
Every corner on Bolivialand, memory of a coast lost in Chile's hands in the blood conflict in the 19th century, still alive -- as well as the desire to sail into the Pacific Ocean again.
Such hopes may have been the most burning for decades, since Bolivia was waiting for the decision of international justice on October 1, October 1, which was a five - year review.
Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian businessman who shared: "Blivia has the motivation, the spirit of unity, and calmness, and of course, to expect in positive vision of the outcome."
Many Bolivian people will follow the laws of ICJ on large screens across the country, hoping that the Court of The Tenue will support Bolivia' declarations, that after decades of stress - Chile has the duty to negotiate with Bolivia a way to the coast of power.
Evovance, the chief president of Bolivia, faced a severe debate in the next year -- had a lot of cards on the second day's decision.
At the end of August, he was determined: "We are about to be returned to the Pacific Sea."
But some analysis suggest that the court is unable to decide to support Bolivia - and that it is less likely to change.
The Netherlands headquarters did not have the right to give the territory back to Chile and decided that they would not determine the outcome of potential exchanges.
ICJ's decision was made after six months after the final debate was given to show that the situation was not complicated, Mrs. Paz Zárate, an international law specialist of Chile.
And further than Bolivia's premises, that's four years can be turned back.
Zérate says: "The approach to the sea was attacked by the present Bolivian administration."
In addition, Mr. Garrettttt says that Mr. Javier’s campaigns have turned off all the remaining goods of Chile.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate with each other, but it will be extremely difficult to organize discussions after this.
Two countries have not traded the ambassador since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodrguuez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the judgment of court was very unusual.
Second would give Bolivia "a great opportunity to open up a new era with their relationship with Chile" and a chance to end 139 years of mutual interest," he shared.
Calzadella also claimed that Caspian - is still one of the most famous presidents in Latin America - is using sea problems as a political rescue.
Bolivia adds: "Blivia will never abandon access to the Pacific."
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to walk past the past."
North Korea says that there will never be any solution to nuclear weapons unless they can trust the United States.
The Secretary of State of Korea Ring Ho revealed that his country would never remove nuclear weapons unless they could trust Washington before.
Mr. Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations Council.
He called the United States to carry out his promises at a convention in Singapore between the two sides.
He noted that when President Mike Pompeo seemed to be on his way back to re-starting nuclear policy over three months after his meeting in Singapore with the Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Mr. Ri says that it's a dream of continuing the punishments and protests of the United States against the end of the Korean war to cause Korea to fall away.
Washington's being careful to agree with a statement without PDA to take action that indicates the first weapon dissolve.
Mr. Kim and President of the United States both wanted a second peak meeting.
But there's no little doubt that PACY is very serious about giving up a weapon armory that this nation can view as the only way to secure safety.
Mr. Pompeo is planning the next month's visit to prepare for Kim-Tumump conference.
The Paris branch releases the latest product line of deep caps that are about to cover all over the major streets near you.
If you want to expand your collection of hats or completely avoid sunlight, you don't have to look far away.
The designers and Thom Browne revealed a series of other great and international design groups in their SS1 collection on the ice line would fill up the style of design at the Paris branch week.
The tall hats didn't have the high application to sweep down Instagram this summer and the designers of the design that brought to their creations on the floor.
The highlights of Matso's gift are an too large color hat that has been attached to the hairy ones that look like the eye, and it's covered on the heads of the model.
The other extreme womans have too much size including a memoral melon, a witch hat, and even a caliphus -- but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also reveals a bunch of weird masks -- or possibly a chance for the day of the day, in effect.
More masked lips are as they were in the same way as them, than high fashion.
One design looks like a complete sea diving device with a respirator and a protective lens, and another device looks like a respiratory ice cream.
And if you continue following the giant fashion -- then you're lucky.
The tomb predicts that large and large ears caps can soon cover the waves across the big streets near you.
The big hats became hot on the heels of the ‘La Bomba', the vast hat of Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski used.
It's a big mystery behind the incredible hat that's going up all over the social media that has brought up another creative creation onto the stage -- a bag with a large beach bag near the bathroom.
The bag of oranges that came out of the bag of oranges burned on fire, which was drawn with the edge of a white black hand, was something highlighted in La Riviera SS of Jacquemus at Paris's fashion week.
The famous designer Luke Armmitage shared with FEE Dwayne John, saying: ‘ I hope to see the hats and seabags surrounded by large sea bags on the big streets in the summer -- because the designer created such a huge impact that it was difficult to ignore the needs of large things. ’
John Edward: foreign skills are essential for global citizens
The private schools in Scotland still maintain their excellent learning skills, which are held in 2018 with an excellent training chain of learning, are strengthened by individuals and groups in sports, art, music, and activities for community activities.
With more than 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, they are supported by the Swiss General Assembly of Scotland, who is trying to bring the best services to students and parents.
Depending on being well - equipped and broad, as well as the career and position of students, as global citizens.
As an education that can design and run a particular school teaching program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and selected in schools.
Nelsona once said, "If you talk to someone in his language, he understands, what it says is going to go into his mind.
If you talk to him in his own language, what's going to go into his feelings."
This is an convincing message that we do not rely only on English when we wish to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Since recent exams of this year, we can see that the foreign language is taking the lead in arrangements with the best - known standards in the private school.
The total of 68 percent of foreign students are higher than A.
The data collected from 74 percent of SCUS's members shows that 72 percent of students have more students than A in Chinese, which is 72 percent studying German, 69 percent of French and 63 percent of Spanish learning Spanish as well.
This shows that the private schools in Scotland are following their own language - based skills that children and teenagers will not be able to have in the future.
The selected foreign learnings are being considered as highly as STEM majors (STahara, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the study programs at private schools as well as elsewhere.
A survey was conducted by the British and British Council of England in 2014 that showed in difficult reasons for finding people, because of missing foreign skills.
As a result, foreign skills have become more practical to equip young people into future career fashions.
With more opportunities for career prospects to have a foreign language, these skills have become practical in a world that is increasingly flat.
No matter how people choose to work, if they learn a second language, they'll get a real advantage in the future when there's such a full-time skill.
A local person can directly communicate directly with the native language, and a majority of language will evidently take the lead in all trials.
According to a survey by youGov over 2,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75 percent of them cannot be conducted a simple part of a different language, and only French is the only language that has a ratio that has hundreds of units, 15 percent.
That is why investing in foreign - language teaching is vital for children today.
In most languages, especially the languages of developing economy, will be equipped for better potential to find a job.
In Scotland, each school taught different languages.
Some schools will focus on more modern languages, while others will teach other languages that are considered important to the English in sight by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your interest, there's a variety of languages to choose between the private schools, along with the professional teachers in the trade.
The private schools in Scotland focus on a well - prepared and equipped environment for kids who are needed skills for success, no matter what the future holds.
In an international business environment, foreign language will continue to be a very important factor to the future of the country, which should be extended in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered " international communication skills."
The private schools will continue to give this opportunity to the German youths: diversity and export them.
There can't be any other choice.

Star Virginia's campaign in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight, at Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Hop started campaigning.
This is the first stop on the five journeys of TT's campaign next week, which includes stopping in state of support like Tennessee and Mississippi.
The vote was approved for the candidate by his suggestion to the empty seat of the Supreme Court is being delayed, the president of Supp is trying to fight support before the next election, where the Republicans are at the risk of losing their power of Congress when the election begins in November.
Our speech in West Virginia starts tonight and how can you watch it online?
Winp's campaign in Wheeling City, West Virginia, expected to start at 7:00 tonight at the east, Saturday, September 29/9/2018.
You can track the movement of TTB on West Virginia, live live on YouTube.
President Hop may have mentioned the hearing during this week of Kovanaugh - the Supreme Court judge - who is now facing sexual assaults and the church's legal vote must be re-reputed a week for the FBI to investigate.
However, the main purpose of these preaching campaigns to fight to pull back the support of the Republicans before the election of November 11th.
Thus, according to Reuters, the purpose of campaign campaign through 05 next week to "to strengthen volunteers and citizens who support the Republicans in the race of security and open the majority of votes they hold in the Senate and the House."
"The Congress Control is an important issue in the program, so the president is going to visit many of the state's most states before entering the busy election season," said the speech speaker of the TTB wants to be hidden from Reuters.
According to the WHOco School of Wheling, the city of Wheeling, tonight's campaign can appeal to those who support the word "Ohio and Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania, while attracting the media to the London media, the West Virginia News station says.

THE Ryder of the year 2018: The U.S. Army showed their determination to fight up on board games on Sunday.
After three unfavorable games, a fight in Saturday afternoon may be necessary for the Ryder Ryder.
An angel's wrist-like type of throat is a completely new sport concept, but it's also the effect that the athlete really believes, especially in games like this.
So where is the current motivation?
"They've led six points, flying now is just four, and I think it's the motivation for us," said Jordan Spieth to share when traveling to relax.
Of course, the European team has the advantage, leading four points, and they have 12 more games.
Like Spieth said, the U.S. recruits still have a lot of hope and they're very encouraging, especially with the couple of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who've been fighting many times and each of them spent three points.
Spieth was an old golf player in playing football from a ball to a golf hole and he was always taking the lead as an example.
The shouts were getting bigger and bigger when they arrived at your game, especially when you and Thomas beat them into a golf hole.
That's the same fight against 15th, which means you're fully convinced in the back of the U.S. team.
Spieth said, "You must think very carefully and worry about your own games."
All the athletes are gone.
There's 18 holes left to score.
In the last two days, only Francesco bitinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an impossible myth of Reyder, is the only pair that spends a higher score than Spieth and Thomas.
This lovely couple of European teams have won 4:0 and cannot make mistakes.
"Molwood" is the only match that doesn't beat up on Saturday afternoon afternoon, but also avoids bogy on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, Saturday afternoon, and nine holes after Friday morning.
That victory and the source of power from them spread to the cycretwood crowd that gave people the feeling that they were the enemy to defeat on Sundays; and there was no golfer better than Fleetwood or a youngerinari to protect the European team at sunset in Lelf National.
I hope you both show up in different golf holes.
Although, it's still too early to claim the victory of the European team.
Jorge Watson and Webbeth defeated young John Garcia, the hero of the fourball fight in the morning, when they fought with Alex Noren.
The first nine holes made Spanish and Swedish bases completely lost their opportunity to react.
On Sunday, I'm afraid no one can pull them out of that failure.
The Fourball games and foursome are always most likely to see because of the interaction between the pairs, their advice and their observation of playing strategy changes only in the context.
The European teams fought better and led pretty far ahead of the day of the final contest, but this series of foursome showed that the U.S. team still had a chance to win.
The European Team led by 10-6 before the final day of the match, Clarade Ryder.
The European Army will take advantage of the last day of the Ryder fight after the race of Fourball and the mighty, leading to the US team 10-6.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco bitainari lead this way with two Tiger Woods to win four points on Le Golf National.
Thomas Controler of Europe, with determination to get back to your team in Hazeltine two years ago, won the United States back in the race of Fourball in the morning, led by 3-1.
The U.S. team fought better in a series offoursome games, won't win the last win.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in a single row on Sunday to get the rest of it back.
Fleetwood was the first European player who won four extra points when he and aMolinari, often called the couple "Molliwood" were the second couple after the day of the tragic games that won four points in four opening games in the history of Ryder.
After hitting Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourball fight, they have a better convincing victory than the U.S. Woods and Bryson Dechambeau with 5=4 points.
Woods fought two fights on Saturday and sometimes there were moments of light, but by now, he lost 19/29 in the race of fourball and foursome, which had seven consecutive battles.
Justin Rose, after rest in the race of fourball in the morning's fall back with Mr. House Stenson in the race of foursome, beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, two golf players line one and three in the world, with two points of 2&1.
However, although the western weather in Paris was very pleasant, the European team didn't have an easy day.
The warrior who won three times greater than Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas put an important surprise on the U.S. team with two points on Saturday.
They won 2=1 previous Spanish golfer, Jon Ramm and Ian Lelter in the Fourball game, and then they went on to defeat Rotherter and Rory McIlroy with 43 points in the foursome game, even though they missed the first two holes.
In the history of Ryder, there's only twice a team taken before four points that can start single fights, though, the Furyk team just has to hold the peace of keeping up.
After only being considered second standing in two days, Sunday would be likely to be the opposite for this team.
North Korea declared 'no way' to solve the armor without faith
South Korea spoke before the United Nations on Saturday, claiming that the punishments were still being held further and deeper into their doubts to the United States and in this situation, there was no way that this country left behind nuclear weapons.
Mr. Ring Ho spoke during the annual meeting of the United Nations Council, stating that North Korea has carried out "Involvement" during the past year, such as stopping nuclear tests and rockets, removing nuclear tests and pledges that are not available to promote nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"Well, we don't see the same move from the United States" he said.
"If we can't trust the U.S., we can't be confident of national security, and in such a situation, there's no way we're free to move forward."
Although Mr Ri continues to repeat North Korea's familiar complaint about refusing to release nuclear weapons "in each phase" and Korea will receive equal benefits as they take steps, his statement has an interesting point that he does not refuse to refuse a single solution to nuclear solution.
Mr. Ri mentioned a general statement concerned by Kim Jong Un and Mr. Donald Pop at the first convention between an American president and an Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in this statement, he committed a commitment to "but the nuclear weapon on the island of Korea," while he promised to protect Korea's security.
North Korea is still trying to find an official way to end the Korean war in 1950, but the U.S. insisted that P.A. will abandon nuclear weapons first.
Washington also opposed the cry for silenced national punishments that suffered inflammation.
"In addition to "Rearition of nuclear weapons" and increased the force of punishments to achieve their purpose in order to achieve their purpose in order, even against "the end of the war," said Ri.
"The point that punishment may cause us to bow our knees to fall flat is just a wild dream of those who don't understand us.
But the problem is that punishment orders continue to continue to lose our confidence."
Mr. Ri did not mention planning for a second convention between President Kim and President of the U.S. leader of the United States at the beginning of the week.
Instead, this foreign minister refers to three meetings between President Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past year and added: "If the deal of dealing with the solution of nuclear except nuclear weapons is in Korea, then no nuclear negotiations will be sold into Korean peace like this."
Yet, Mr. Ri's tone was quite different from last year, when he said before the Council that Korea's putting fire into the U.S.'s continent was something impossible to escape in a suicide mission after "Dect" called Mr. Kim "A".
Last year in the United Nations, Mr. Controver threatened to be "the total destruction," but now this year, he has all the credit for the courage to take his step against the United Nations, but he also stressed that there is so much work to be done and that the disciplines continue to remain until Korea solves nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, TT. Pup said that he didn't set a time for this: "two years, three years or only five months or not a problem."
China and Russia claim that the United Nations Security Council should be commended for their efforts.
However, U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo on Thursday said before the United Nations Security Council: "The discipline of the Security Council must continue very strong and not tolerate until we can confirm the full nuclear outcome, at last, with proof."
The Security Council has been determined to strengthen the measures of punishment for Korea since 2006 to prevent funding fire programs for the nuclear and nuclear weapons of Pranks.
Secretary Pompeo has called Secretary Ri on behalf of the official meeting of the United Nations Council and said he'll be visiting PDU again in the next month to prepare for a second convention.
Mr. Pompeo has visited Korea three times this year, but the final visit was not very effective.
He left P.A. after his visit in July and said that the negotiation had made certain progress, but only hours later, North Korea accused the foreign minister of asking "like black society."
Korean claims to meet President Moon Jae-In this month to remove a missile test and a nuclear compound if America has a similar "stir" form.
He said President Kim pointed out that "the similar attitude he was looking for was the security security that Cruced in Singapore's conferences and made it normal to have sexual relations with Washington.
Harvard students take full rest school
In an effort to resist mechanical culture, with 'The Night', drink coffee, a new course at Harvard this year has encouraged all college students to sleep more.
Students at college have often no idea how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medical medicine at Harvard University, was also an expert at Women's Hospital and Wykham, who designed this course, and he believed that this was the first class of this kind of thing in America.
The excitement started this course after he joined a talk about the impact of lack of sleep on the learning process.
'After the end of the talk, a student came to me and said, 'Why did you finally know this?'
She said that no one told her about the importance of sleep, which really surprised me, he shared with The views.
The course was introduced for the first time this year, explaining to students the importance of good sleep habits to improve their learning and sports results, and also to improve your shared health.
Paul Barririra, professor of theology at Harvard University, ran medical services for the university, stating that the school decided to introduce this course after finding out that students were in serious sleep during the week.
An extended course consists of an interactive series of tasks.
In part of some feature of the Secretary's Office, where students can click on coffee, shopsticks, trains, and books to learn about the effects of cacine, light, and the lack of sleep affects how the exercise works, as well as the importance of creating the habit of going to sleep at the right time.
In other words, those sharing in this long - sleep state may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then the map of the university, with interactive icons, encouraged the participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know that this course can't immediately change students' behavior.
But we believe that you have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know about health when you choose smoking, Professor Czeisler adds.
He said: “The culture of "the Night Tret," is still alive, and at the same time modern technologies and pressures are increasing to students who are in need of sleep, is a serious problem.
The well - sleeping quality of sleep should become a secret weapon of students to resist stress, depression, and anxiety - even to avoid weighting, because the lack of sleep causes the brain to fall into hunger, causing us to continue hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old student in California who was studying biology, chemistry, and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design this course, and he was also involved in one of his first classes in Harvard.
He said that the course helped him to ‘ see ’ and inspired him to try to hold up a course within the entire school.
You hope that the next step will be to suggest that all student studies after college participate in a similar course before starting competition in the main course.
Professor Czeisler urged students to consider making alert to sleeptimes, time to wake up, and need to realize the effects of ' blue light' coming out of the computer screen and the LC, can cause your biochemosis, which can lead to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Malachis: Menga cut down Gerrard's boys
Fear ofs has a day of fight that doesn't work when Dolly Menga's reaction has caused Steven Gerrard's team to fail with a billion 1-0 before Livingston.
Ibrox was hoping to mark the first victory from winning 4-1 at St. Johnstone's airport in February 2, but Gary Hyrdon's team had caused the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 fights as an instructor, pulling about eight points compared to the leader of the Ladenbes Premieriershits.
Menga maintains a seven-minute attack before the end of the first round, but Kana's atmosphere seems to have never been crushed.
NetRanger has now fallen on the sixth position, while Livingston has climbed to the third position and only after Hibernia has won the loss.
And it's also a problem to deal with another problem after the editor of Calum Spence has to treat the wound in his head after a object is clearly thrown from the front of the hotel.
Gerrard's changed eight times compared to the team that passed Ayr to sell Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt kept Livi 11 in peace and won a point ahead of Hetts last week, and he must have been very happy how his students attacked each of the attacks.
Although Chiss had more shadows, Livingston was actually a real dangerous team when there was a ball.
They should have recorded only two minutes after Menga first blew Scott Whistman into the yard, attacking the city box of Allan witnessor, but the guard missed this opportunity.
A deep kick of Keaghan Jacobs takes the ball to Captain Craig Halkett, but behind Alan Lithgow can only take the ball behind the frame.
But their lifestyle is primarily based on hope more than faith, especially in the end of the game.
Alfred Morelos was sure that he had to get the punishment on the payments for him and Steven Lawless had struck but respected Steven Thomson to reject this Colombian player's appeal.
It's only two times the size of the frame in the first round, but the former Ibrox Kelly hardly had any trouble with Lassana Cocalibaly's initial hit and Ovie Ejariia's attack.
Although Lvi opened the number of hours at the 34th minute, no one could deny that their victory was absolutely worth it.
Again, Scars couldn't handle Jacobs' deep pitch.
Scott Arfield couldn't have been able to react to the reaction of Declan Gallagher playing ball for Scott ways, and Scott would have chosen Menga to make a simple end.
Gerrard immediately had a plan for vacations, by replacing thelibaly With Ryan Kent and replacing this person almost immediately as soon as the plane runs this wing against Morelos, but Kelly was impressed when he stopped the ball.
But Livingston succeeded in drawing visitors to the same game as they wanted, when Lithgow and Halket were constantly spreading long passes.
Holt's team had a chance to move forward in the final minutes of the match, but unfortunately, that Mr. Thorregor had chosen the right location to prevent Jacobs before Lithgow started his head out of the corner.
The new player into the Middleton field continues to insist on the payment of the temple after touching Jacobs, but once again he was seriously rejected by Thomson.
According to the magazine, the author of the Geiger count
A page from the editor of The Sunday: On September 30, November 30,1823, 156 years ago, and 176 B.C.E. ...the future physicists... the future physicists; the First Hands, Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and radiation, developed the basis for the device called Geiger count.
Since then, the Geiger count has become not only a science pillar, but also a pillar of their culture. For example, the following example is a conversation in the movie "Bells of Coronado," which is based on the participation of the scientist Mr. President Royvre and Dale Evans:
"What is this?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger count, used to locate radiation minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these ears, the sentence can actually hear the impact of the radioactive atoms in the fluid."
Evans: "Yes, there's a noise here!"
"Hant" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days after his 63th birthday.
The invention, however, will remain with you forever.

New cancer may teach the immune system how 'The murder cell' is broken and destroyed them.
Please teach the immune system how to identify broken cells during the treatment.
This method includes getting immune cells from patients, changing cells in the lab
Then these cells can't be seen by the common protein in many cancers and be injected into the body.
A test line is giving possible results from patients with different cancer patients.
A woman who was treated with cacresss taught the immune system to realize that her broken cells and her ovoma cell cell disappeared over 18 months later.
This method includes taking away immune cells from patients, changing cells in the lab, so that these cells can "see" in many cancers, called HER2, then injected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Library Library, Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our research reveals that we are in the hands of a very promising operation."
HER2 "Buzzling the development of some kind of cancer," including breast cancer, eggs, lungs, and vast lungs, Professor Berzofsky explains.
A similar method of research, taking immune cells from the patient's body and "trant" they target the target of cancer cells, which had been done during treatment of a kind of disease.

Health officials say that this country has over 820,000 people with this disease.
In our own 2018 ’ s, the number of new infections was identified as 40,000.
Most of the new infections are caused by sexual infections, which is a huge change in the past.
Before, HlV quickly spread in some parts of China because of blood transfusions.
However, some people who infected HlV in this path have dropped almost equal to 0. This is a statement by Chinese political officials at a conference in the province of Han Nam.
However, the number of people who live with HlV and Aives in China for years has increased to 100,000 people.
The virus through sex is a serious problem happening in the Chinese social media.
Although homosexuality is no longer considered illegal in China since 1997, in fact, behavior differs from social LGBT community.
Because of this country's political standards, it's estimated 70-90 percent of men are still married, although sexual relations with men.

Mrs. Maxine Waters denied her staff to reveal data from the Republican senators, stressing 's dangerous lies' and 'Struculation of conspiracy'.
On Saturday, the American Democratic Party, Maxine Waters, rejected the charge that a member of your staff had published personal information on the three senators of the Republicans on Wikipedia page.
The Democratic Party in Los Angeles claimed that these charges were due to the right experts and the set-up sites.
"A lie, a lie, and a more humiliating lie," wrote Waters in a post on Twitter.
According to the report, leak information includes private home addresses and the number of senators of the United States of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hat, from Utah State.
These information began to appear on the Internet on Thursday, since a man who was not aware of his identity in the House of the Hill Hill during the time of the Senate hearing of sexual assault against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Kovanaugh.
This information has been revealed for a short time after this senator questioned Kavanaugh.
The Hill wrote: “The web pages are such as Gatewayrandit and Red State reported that IP addresses identify the origin of articles related to Mrs. Waters' office and reveal information about one of Mrs. Waters' employees.
Mrs. Waters continues to say, "It's absolutely not true and absolutely a lie."
"The members of my office have been violated with identity, personal information, and the safety of these false and misleading charges could never have been the one who revealed them.
This foundation is completely inexplicable and totally a lie."
This comment by Mrs. Waters immediately drawn criticism online, including the former Secretary of the White House, Ari Fleisscher.
"This rejectr shows rage" wrote Fleisscher.
"This shows that she has no gas to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of an act that is not what they do, people should not be angry.
They are not challenged.
They are not questioned about the motives of the authorities.
They must display calm and quietness."
Flescher seems to have been comparing Waters' reaction to Judge Kavinaugh before the Democratic Party's criticisms and the critics also accused him that he was too angry at the annual hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running into Waters' position during the midterm election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
If that's true, he wrote it on Twitter.
Mrs. Waters claimed that her office warned the authorities and the law enforcement agency about these corrupt charges.
"We will make sure the unsub will be given light," she continues to say, "and they will be responsible for all the actions that could damage and dangerous to any of my employees."
Johnny English is on the line. - The bad guy of Rowan Atkinson's humor.
Now, it is possible to see a rather traditional trend in any new film that has the English element of search for the meaning of Brexit, and then learns from a series of comic movies about Johnny English spy is not an exception.
Will the act of self-respect the subject of being in vain how do we turn into an opportunity to export to this nation?
In any case, Johnny English agent, whose powers are limited with a wide, open eye, and the system, is permitted to spread everything up again -- his name is merely representing a comic book designed for non-English areas.
Of course, he's a secret agent, though he's always pretending to duck in the manner of Detective Clouseau, mixed with Mr. Clouseau's humor and something that contributed to Charots' theme of the Waters of the London Open Festival of London in 2012.
The prototype is also based on visitors and international hero Atkinson who used to play in the Barclaycard TV show that has now been in forget and has caused chaos when he wakes up.
There's some pretty interesting sight in Johnny English's latest video.
I like Johnny English near the helicopter while I wear my middle suit and the wings that hit his hat.
Although Atkinson's humor was fully shown, the humor factor here seems to not quite enough, and it's a bit of weight and a bit of a waste, especially when the movie brands of "mortal" as a series of movies and the impossible mission that made sense of humor are just a kind of fun.
The funny factor in this movie can only laugh children, I think that Johnny English's stupid mistakes have nothing to be creative and interesting as the jokes in Mr. Beethoven movie of Atkinson.
The situation that led to the story was that England was in serious trouble.
Bad news broke into British super secret spy net, revealed the identity of all British agents working outside, led to the loss of a mission agent who was working, a very sorry little role of Kevin Ella.
This is the last chance of the prime minister, a proud and powerful character, who is now facing this direct political crisis: Emma vision has shown very good character by the Prime Minister day, but according to the scenario she didn't have much land.
Assistants report that all the agents of the active agent are exposed and you're going to have to move a partial agent.
And he's Johnny English, and now he's teaching in a country, but in fact, he's teaching lessons outside the program to become a secret agent: there's some pretty interesting joke here, because English teaches students to be teachers in the Rock Academy.
English was called back to the H.S.A. at emergency meeting and was gathered with the former Bough former ex-Bough, by Ben Miller's actor.
Bough is now married, too much for a woman to command a submarine to charm, Vicki needed to take the role that is a little wasted.
So the Batman and Robin team are in trouble with the Queen's order to return to their mission and meet Olga Kurylenko in the role of the beautiful Miss Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into danger at the curse of the most fascinating technology after declaring that he can solve all the problems of the English computer: Jason Voltamine, by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their adventure with unexpected jokes: After they burned up a French restaurant in their eye; they caused chaos on Volta's big boat; and English caused more confusion when they tried to use the virtual ears to visit Volta's house.
At the end of the movie, the buttons will be removed, but such excitement is pretty much like television channels for children.
It's a bit unusual work.
And as with the rest of Johnny English video, I couldn't ask questions: The film industry really can't give Rowan Atkinson a fair role, worthy of your talent?
The labor party rejected information planning to allow the British people to work four days but to receive five days' pay.
Jeremy Corbyn's youth party will consider an advanced plan, allowing the British people to work four days per day but to receive five days' wages.
According to the information received, the party wants the business to transfer the savings through the artificial revolution of human intelligence to the workers by letting them rest for another day.
That means that the staff got off weekend three days, but still paid the same salary.
The sources report that this idea is 'depressed' with the economic program of this party and the development of support for its laborers.
The British convention confirms that moving into working four days/ a day - to - day job is a way to make the workers enjoy the benefits of the economy changing.
A high source of information in the Lao party said to Sunday news: "The program of control of plans will be published at the end of the year.
'This goal cannot be done in short periods of time, but working four days per day is a desire to conform to this party's presummation in the economic balance that has been beneficial for the workers as well as the common industrial strategy of the party.'
The Soviet Party will not be the first people to accept this idea, and the blue party of England has decided to work four days per day during the campaign in 2017.
However, this idea has not yet been moved by the entire Lao party.
“ The book of working four days/ days is not the policy of the party and the party is now not considered to consider this policy. ”
Dark Prime Minister John McDonnell took advantage of the 1990 conference last week to increase the vision of a social revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from the hands of the unnamed Governors and 'Voctors' at useful service companies.
These dark prime plans also mean that many of the women present in water companies may not receive their entire share because the Party's government can apply 'the contexts that are considered wrong.
He also confirmed the plan for the worker to join the company board and set up the company's entire property to give 10 percent of the private companies, from which they were able to get her by 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, sharing in the "60 Minutes" program about whether FBI investigations about Kovanaugh has made them change their decision.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Court Court Judge Kvanaugh has delayed the final vote to appoint him as Judge of the Supreme Court for at least one week and ask whether the investigation of federal intelligence might cause any Republican officers to return their support.
During a broadcast interview on Sunday, the program reporter "60 Minutes" Scott Hympley asked the Republican Senator John Kennedy and LSUDS if the FBI could find evidence that could change these senators' decision.
Mr. Kennedy was more open to his coworker from South Carolina State.
"I suppose of course," said Mr. Kennedy.
"I said in the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, which means after the charges were made and asked 'Do you do it?'
He answered very firmly, completely and decisively."
However, Graham’s vote seemed to be quite sure.
He said, "I've decided to go back to Kovanaugh already and only one charges that have a new assault made me change."
" Professor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Kerry denied a lot of power," mentioned Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the women she mentioned couldn't verify the story.
36 years have passed.
I don't see anything change."
What is the global public service and what contributions are made for hunger and poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be overseeing the global public assembly, a annual event with the participation of an impressive star’s office to perform a mission is also no less impressive: the end of poverty in the world.
In the seventh year of this event, the global public convention will witness tens of thousands of people on the Great LPPT of the Central Park not only to enjoy the performance of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Moses Mendes, but also to appreciate the real objective of the actual end of poverty at 2030.
A global civil convention, beginning in 2012, is an extension of the global global emission, an international campaign team with hope of an end to poverty by increasing the number of active people fighting against poverty.
When you're willing to pay for the VIP ticket, who attends the music night must complete a series of tasks or "scret," such as volunteers, send email to a world leader, call a telephone call or any other form of service that will help to enhance the interest of the target of poverty.
But how did this global public convention accomplish its success, but now there are only 12 years left to reach its goal?
Is it a practical way to convince people to call on action, or is it just another form of "key movement" -- people feel that they're creating the actual difference by signing online calls or sending an article on Twitter?
Since 2011, the global public organization has said that there are over 10 million "Actors" from those who have been recorded, encouraging a series of different targets.
They say that these actions have helped to motivate global leaders to make commitments and policys equal to over 37 billion dollars made in order to carry out these steps to improve their lives more than 225 billion people in 2030.
Early in the early 2018 year, the group quoted 390 pledges and announced the activities of the team, at least 10 billion dollars were released or funded.
By so far, funds have been guaranteed to have directly affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments of The Power of Nutition, an organization composed of investors and people who do, pledges to "help children to develop their own abilities," promising to give 25 million dollars to Rwanda to help end this country’s well-being after receiving more than 4700 articles from the global public group.
"With support from the British government, donors, national government, and global citizens like you, we can turn social injustice into an infestation to a sign in history," said Biyllman, who shared with his audience in an live presentation in London in April 2000, in April 1943.
This group also reported that after more than 5,000 actions called the United Kingdom to improve mothers and children, the government published aid for a project known as chemical power, ensures the supply of five million women and children.
Answering one of the questions common on the team's website, "What makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?"
The global public answered, "This is going to be a long and difficult path -- sometimes we will fail.
But like the movement rooms that require civil rights and racial opposition, we will succeed because together, we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Timed, the Krera-Lees, Cardi B, Janelle Monáte is a number of artists who will participate in the performance this year in New York, because Debor-Lee Friness and Brother Jackman are taking the program.
The U.S. Navy can be used to "suppose" Russia's energy exporter--the Secretary of State.
The Washington Examer led the Secretary of State in the United States, Ryan Zinke said: Washington can promote the Navy forces if needed to prevent Russian energy from being sent into the market, including the Middle East market.
Zinke accusedly that Russia was at Syria - more interesting than following the legal government's invitation - just an excuse to visit the new energy market.
According to the report, he said, "I believe that the reason they invaded the Middle East is because they want to trade energy as in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe.
And in official faith, there are many ways and measures to stop this.
He said, "The U.S.U. has the ability to use Navy forces to ensure that the sea-still traffic lines are still open and will be closed, when necessary, to ensure their energy is not sent into the market."
Zinke has called for those who attend the event organized by the consumer Power Union, a non-profit group called "The talk of energy users" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington to Russia and Iran’s way of doing things and note that these two things work exactly the same way.
"The economic project that Iran and Russia can choose is to use and change fuel," he said, while he called Russia, "one only has one force" with the economy based on fossil fuel.
The statement is made when the government of TT. Pop is trying to increase the amount of natural fuel into Europe, to replace Russia's location, choice is much easier for European consumers.
To achieve this goal, the officials of the TTM government, including the American president Donald Peck himself, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the North Nord Strem 2 "unk" United States, which led Moscow to a full control of Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Nord Strem 2.2 value of 11 billion worth of dollars was built to double the power of the pipe which appears to be about 110 billion feet [10 billion kg], and this is a simple economic project.
The media argues that the harsh opposition from Washington to this project simply comes from economic reasons and is an example of unsatisfying competition.
"I believe we have the same opinion that energy can't be tools to force and consumers must be chosen by the donor," said the Russian Minister Aleksandk Novak, who said after the meeting with the American secretary Rick in Moscow.
The U.S. school has caused a violent reaction from Germany, and then this country has confirmed the commitment to participate in the project.
Germany's leading industry, German Union (BDI), has called the United States not to interfere with the European Union's energy policy, as well as global agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have to face a big problem when there's a third nation trying to interfere with our energy supply." Dideter Adamf, president of the German Union, said after the meeting between the German Prime Minister Angelakel and the Russian Russian general Vladimir Pin.

18 states and D.C. supporting the challenge of new refugee policies
Eight states and Distre of Columbia are supporting the new U.S. policy against victims running away from gangs or domestic violence.
NBC News delivered information from 18 states and D.C. sent a short document on Friday in Washington to support refugees who were asking against this policy.
They're full names of the entire unit in Grace and Sessions that the American Free Nations were paid in August to protest against the federal policy that has not yet been revealed.
She said her lover "and the son of the members of his violent gang" abused her but American officials refused to ask for her victim on July 20,07.
You're in Texas.
The prosecutors of Grace support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where there are large numbers of people who submit refugees in the United States when countries face gang problems and family violence rather common.
The United States's new refugee policy went contrary to the 2014 resolution of the Council’s Council to warn Di people that they have no papers that run out of domestic violence to ask for refugees.
President Disstent General Distent of Columbia Karl Ricine declared on Friday that the new policy "is off the state law system, state, state and internationals have been for decades."
"The federal government requires to consider all refugees' requests based on the events and specific circumstances of the requester and the policy that interferes with that principle," the short text shown.
The prosecutors also argue in short texts that the policies refuse to harm the United States economy, because immigrants have many abilities to become workers and "cung is full of necessary resources."
The President JeffSessions has asked the conscurators to continue not allowing refugees to continue running for victims who fled from domestic violence and abuse of gangs in June.
" Only allow refugees to leave their country because of oppression or fear of race, religion, nationality, or member of a group of social or political views," he said in his book on November 11,06.

The American ambassador accused China's abuse of 'incurriccation by 'the media'
After a week after a Chinese official newspaper ran a four - page commercial on an American newspaper that referred to the general interest in American business, American ambassador, U.S. spoke against the use of American newspapers.
Last Wednesday, the President of the U.S. President Donald PlP mentioned an additional advance of China Daily for Des Moines Register -- the best run newspaper of Iowa State -- after the Chinese charge was trying to interfere with the United States election on November 6, 11.
Let's see what this is all about, the New American election, which is about the way the Beijing is trying to intervene in the election in America, marking a new period of campaign in a campaign that has been causing the Chinese of Washington according to what American officials share with Reuters.
Even though foreign governments set up commercial advertising as an entirely normal, Beijing and Washington are now trapped in the climbing trade, with evidence that they have been down high taxes with both parties' imports.
China and the United States experts say that Chinese political tax policy in return to anger during the first phase of the war was designed to enter exports in the state of the Republican Republic of TTC.S. like Iowa.
Terry Branstad, American ambassador in China and former president of Iowa, U.S.A., exports big farmers to China, says that North America has hurt workers, farmers, and business.
Branstad writes a comment on the Des Moines Register Sunday, saying that China's continuing to do that by running a statement on our own free newspaper."
"In an effort to spread, the Chinese government is using traditional tradition of speech and American free press as ad of money on Des Moines Regster," Branstad.
"In addition, at the news stands on the streets of Beijing, you are very rarely very rarely found the disagree and will not see any real reflection of Chinese ideas about China's tough economic orbits, because obviously the media is in full control of the Chinese People's media," he wrote.
He even added that "One of the most popular newspapers in China has escaped his recommendation," even though he did not say which newspaper he was.
Reporters warn the Republican Party are causing the women to stay away from before the midterm election with Kavanaugh's mission.
When members of the Republican Party are at the front guard for the Supreme Court's Supreme Court of Court Court Kvanaugh before some sexual assaults, the analysts warn that they may be reactively, especially from women, in the middle of the election.
The emotion around this is pretty strong and most of the Republican candidates on the campaign list are going to show them they want to keep votes.
There are things we can't do again," Grant Reeher, a political professor at the University of Syria at Syracuse University, told The Hill in a article published on Saturday.
Mr. Reeher said that he didn't think that Senator Jeff Flake (Bung R-Arizona) would agree with the FBI doing enough to ease the votes.
The Washington newspaper, D.C., led Adae Jean-Pierrere, senior adviser and national translator of the group making up MoveOn Friday: "The woman won't forget what happened yesterday -- tomorrow they won't forget and they won't forget it.
Reporting: On Friday morning, the protestors of "The 11" were coming up!" as they launched on the Senate's hall because the Republicans were at control of the Justice Committee of Justice had chosen to continue to vote for Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blas Ford.
"The interest and response of democracy will be higher than ever," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-municist political analysis of the news.
"It is said that this motivation is now highly offered; yes, it is.
But it may be even higher, especially among women in the outside and young elections, from 18 to 29 years old, who often don't vote because they don't like president."
Even before Mrs. Ford publicly sworn that the details of sexual assault against the Supreme Court official, the experts concluded that the public might have a violent reaction if the Republicans continued to confirm it.
NBC News told Michael Steele, former minister of the Republican Party last week: "This could be a mess that the Republicans had to deal with."
"The problem is not just to vote for a committee or vote or to vote or to vote, or whether Kovaugh does become a Supreme Court Judge or not, but the matter is more important than the fact that the Republicans handle this case and how they treat the accused," Guy, who is director of the International Court of Human Rights, who supports the Democratic Party, spoke to the media.
However, American people have a misunderstanding about believing in Mrs. Ford's testimony or Mr. Kavanaugh, which seems to have been more suspicious of Mr. Kavanaugh.
A new survey held by youGov shows that 41 percent of the people answered for sure or could believe Ford's testimony, while 35% said they were sure or could believe Kovanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent of people who responded to the thought that Kavaugh may or certainly have lied to the testimony, while 30 percent thought that Ford was certain or may have lied.
After Flake hit the contract, the FBI is working on Mrs. Ford's charges and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian.
Ford swore before the Senate committee last week that Kavaugh attacked her when she was drunk, when she was 17.
Ramirez accused the candidate at the Supreme Court's Court's Court's Court's office to reveal his before her when they went to a party during the study period in the 1980s of 1980s.

Solid allows users to choose where to store data and what rights to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fastardny, Berners-Lee said that the purpose behind the Inrupt project was "to rule the world."
"We have to start right away," he said about this career project.
"It's a historical moment."
Solid technology users, allow users to make online " personal data management" or their own edD data.
This data can include the list of contacts, the list of jobs to do, the calendar, the music library, the personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, SARK and Spotify, it's all available on a browser and shows it at the same time.
The unique thing about this online data store is that the user has the full right to decide which type of information he can access.
It's called "transition control data control."
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, the idea of the Inrupt project is to ensure that the company is equipped with resources, procedures, and skills that are suitable to help give Solid to everyone.
There are now Berners-Lee, Bruce, a secure foundation that was purchased by IBM, some developers signed the contract to work on the project and a community of volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own silent applications using the tools available on the Inrut website.
Bierners-Lee said that he and his group don't discuss with "Facebook and Google about things that have changed completely, because all their business models are completely possible after one night.
"We don't have to ask them."
In a song on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote "Inrupt's destiny is to provide commercial energy and a ecosystem that protects the integrity and quality of the newly built site on the Solid foundation."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when creating the World Wade Web.
In recent years, Berners-Lee has been a powerful name in the debate about the neutrality of the internet network.
Despite the release of the Inrupt project, Berners-Lee will continue to take on the role of the founder and director of the World Bank of the World Wade Web Web Web, Web Foundation and the Open Library.
"I'm extremely optimistic about the next generation of web," said Berners-Lee.
The anniversary of Sir Bernard Vann's Memorial of the Victoria Cross during World War One.
The Memorial of 100 years of the Church of England was given by Queen Victoria in the first world war as a warrior held in his home.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won a medal on September 29th/118 in the attack on Walgalse and Lehaucourt.
However, he died being snipered four days later and himself never learned that he had won the highest honourary medal of the British army.
On Saturday, his two grandsons revealed a memorial on Rushden tour, Northamptonshire.
One of these sons, Michael Vann, said that this was "a glorious symbol" when the stone was presented right after the war that helped his grandfather win the medal.
According to the London newspaper, on January 29,9993, Colonel Vann led his crew across Canon de St. Saint-Quutin "the thick fog of thick fog, under strong fire from school and machine gun."
Then he went straight straight into the bullet and with the great "stirt," he led the crew up, before he went into a school shooter and took down three specifics.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on April 4,18 - only a month after the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, says that his grandfather's actions were "the actions that I never could do, but there was humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also put on a flower ring after the royal tour of the Royal Kingdom.
Michael Vann said that he felt greatly honored to participate in the march and "the courage of a true hero would be noted by the support of so many people."
The sports fans all night to see Bellator 206, but they finally got Peppa Pag
Imagine you've been awake all night to see Bellator 206 with a tight and tight radio, but you're finally denied to see the main event.
The introduction from San Jose says that there are 13 fights in which there are six fights on the main card and are live all night at England on the 5.
At 6:00 a.m., as soon as Gegard Mousasi and Rorybon are prepared to fight, the viewer in England is overwhelmed when the screen is turned into Pepa Pag.
Some feel that they are not respected after they wake up to see the game.
A fan shows on Twitter that changing the program to the child's animation movie is like "a very charming joke."
"The government decrees that the art content of art at 6: 00 a.m. is not appropriate, so they must be converted into child programs," said Dave Javiertz, president of Bellator's highest director, and announced when asked about this program.
"Peppa the pag," yes."
President Bellator, Scott Coker said they're looking at broadcast schedules to make sure the English audience can see the future show.
Mr. Coker said, "I think we can solve the problem."
"But on that side was six o'clock in Sunday morning and we couldn't handle it until Sunday after our day, but Monday after their hour.
But we're trying to find a solution.
Believe me, when people change the program, there are lots of messages over and those messages aren't very friendly.
We've been trying to overcome, at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But that's not the end of the government, but it's the government's rule.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We're going to take down the number of games down to the year, instead of six games like our first audience -- five is the number of games we usually provide, and we've tried to give the fanrs over.
This is really a bad situation."
The Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt like'The Poor' program about sexual trends
The Olympic Bridge, Tom Daley, shared that when he grew up, he always lost people because of his sexual tendency — but that was his successful motivation.
24-year-old athletes don't realize "I'm not like anybody" until I study in school.
Talking on the Desert Island Discs of the 4th radio by Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke himself about the rights of gay men to bring to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning in the Olympics.
The rice director of this long program, Kirsty Young, had spent several months of his illness.
The first among the first of Laverne led, Daley appeared as a missing man, saying that he felt like "The Poor" everyone, because "Your nature was not accepted as a man and a daughter."
He said, "To this day, my feelings about feeling that I have lost and the difference exists, becomes motivated and powerful so that I can succeed."
I'd like to prove that you've got something to do so that people don't be disappointed to know the truth about your sexual trends.
The athlete once won this Olympic medal as a positive athlete for the LGBT community and he used his image at the World Health Organization in Australia this year to call more countries against the distinction against homosexuality.
He said himself because he felt very lucky to be able to live open, unstinuated, and wanted to give it to others.
The three World champions share that he loves a man who loves American film maker Dustin Lance Black Black, who met in 2013 and said, "You love each other."
Daley was married to a winner of Oscar over 20 years old, but he said that he had never been able to interfere with his age.
"When you have to experience so much pain as a child" -- he was in the Olympic World for the first time when he and his father died from cancer 3 years later -- it would be hard to find someone who was at the same age as he experienced in his lifetime.
The couple became Robert Ray Black-Daley's parents in June and Daley said that your entire world has changed.
"If you asked me last year my goal was 'I must win the gold chapter," he said.
"But you know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal was Robbie."
His son was named after Robert’s father died in 2011 in his 40 ’ s after diagnosed with brain cancer.
He said that his father did not accept the fact that he was about to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had a chance for world convention in London in 2012 -- because he wanted to sit in the front seat.
"I couldn't tell him, 'cha can't sit in the front seat anymore," he said.
"I hold his hand when he pours out his last breath and even until he stops breathing and goes away forever, I can't finally admit that he was an unsolveable man."
The following year, Daley fought at the Olympic World in 2012 and won the medal.
"I know that it's the dream of my whole life -- dancing before the pride crowd in the Olympic World, really, there's no better feeling than that," he said.
It's also an inspiration for you to choose your first song - Proud's Promall - the song with him during his training on the Olympic World and still touched him every time he heard it.
The Desert Island Discs program broadcast on the 4th radio at 11:15 BST, Sunday.
Mihson is lacking on the front seat with Ryder on Saturday.
The American player Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when playing Ryder's opening game, but he will have to raise his height to avoid this record into a sad experience.
Mihson played in the event of organized two years once 12 times this time, but Captain Jim Furyk left him sitting in a chair in a series of Fourballs and foursome Saturdays.
Instead of acting as a center in America, these five winners have to spend all day working and playing games with the hope of getting rid of their feelings.
The 48-year-old player at the school was never the best choice for the Le Golf National, even when you're at the top level, because the wrong hit here will suffer severe consequences.
And if this golf ring isn't enough to cause an allegation yet, Mickelson has to fight in the 9th day against his opponent as the British champion of Francesco Claryari, which is still in the first week with Tommy Fleetwood and win all four wars.
If U.S. Teams are now losing 4 points before starting a series of 12 single games that are very impressive, Mickelson's fight is important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his golfer and did not say too much.
"He understands his role today, he slaps on my back, spins through me and says he'll be ready for tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He's very confident.
He's a legend and has contributed to the entire team, in the past and in the past week.
I could never imagine he played two games.
I imagine more, but that's how things happen and we think that's the right way.
He wants to fight, like all the other team."
Today, Mickelson will cross Nick Faldo's record, become the greatest matchr in the Ryder Ryder.
It may also be his ending of his career at the Ryder Ryder because the high peaks of his personal record have never been seen in this tournament.
Mihson has 18 winners, 20 winnings and peace, although Mohik thinks his presence gives an invisible value for the team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he explains.
"I think young guys are very happy to see him and this week is quite fun.
What he's dedicated to is more than competition."
The European Army captain Thomas;) knows that the previous benefits can quickly disappear.
Thomas Thomas, Captain Ryder, had experienced that even though his team had led a lot of before entering the final games of the Ryder season, the result could still be easy to reverse.
The Dane began fighting in 1997 in Valderrama, where their recruits, under Seve Ballsteros led five points before the U.S. team, but at last they won only 14-131%.
"You always have to remind yourself that we've been leading a lot in Valderrama; we've led a lot of previous lead at Brookline and we lost, in Valderrama, but we won, but we're very tight," said the look on the face, after seeing the 14th class of 204 with 53 victorys on Fridays and taking 10 on the street of Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone in the team that it's not over.
You still have to focus on your spirit tomorrow.
It's good to go to the yard and play games.
The game is not over when the score is not present on the table.
We have the goal of winning this year and that's our focus.
I've always said that I've been focusing on my 12 golfers, but we also understand the power of my team -- they are the best golfers in the world."
Happy about the display of his players on the beautiful golf platform, the addition, "I'll never say anything.
It'll be another war tomorrow.
Tomorrow is the individual's display, and it'll definitely be different.
It'll be great to fight along and it's going to happen well, but when you fight on your own, all the possibilities of a golfer will be revealed.
That's the message you have to share with every golf player, that they have to be ready for the best match tomorrow.
Now a competition has to separate and each one must be ready for the best."
In contrast, the captain of the opponent, Jim Lockyk, waited for his golfers to show better personal abilities than when playing along with the couple, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won three points of four points.
Furyk himself had been through both directions in big turning steps on the last day, who was a winner member of Brookline before he failed, while the European recruit was declared "The color in Medah."
"I remember every single word," he said when he was asked about Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the team in 1999, who had gathered and encouraged the golfers before the day of the final contest.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'll want to start quickly as quickly as you see in Brookline, or as you see in Medah.
When the results are following a trend, the games in the middle will suffer a lot of pressure.
We built a team that way and we took golf guys to the field of strategy and tried to make a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to lead the fighting team and to the Rory McIlry McIlroy in the highest fight, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Silter, the rest of the Europeans in the first game.
"I choose this group, in that order because I believe it's the way to get past" said about options for my single match.
German warship continued to be delayed into use
Local media reports: The German Navy’s latest axis ship would probably have tried in 2014 to replace old warshipship during the Cold War, but at least five years later it would have been possible to run out of errors and increase.
Die Zeit led the military speaker: "Rheinland-Pfalz," the leader of a completely new axis of Baden-Werttberg, which was now delayed by the early 201.
This ship was supposed to have been assigned to the Navy in 2014, but the trouble after the delivery prevented this ambitious project.
Four types of Baden-Werttemberg ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old boat named Bremen.
So that means that these ships will be equipped with a powerful fortress, a series of air rockets and anti-airers, some invisible technologies, such as reduce radar traces, infrared and sound.
Other important features include longer maintenance time -- can develop the latest axis ships far from countries' docks to two years.
However, this constant delay, which means modern warships -- are supposed to help Germany control the foreign countries -- will become a backback at the beginning of their use, the Die Zeit note.
Unfortunately F125 had become the newspaper last year when the German Navy officially refused to run the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Vos in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the ship after delivery.
There's a lot of information about the reason behind returning this ship, but the German media refers to "still software and hardware" serious, leading to a completely useless battleship if they're involved in the fight.
It's a very serious mistake that the Baden-Wuttetberg ship will be run by 120 sailors -- only half of the forces on the old Bremen axis.
At the same time, it is possible to see that the weight of a significant tank ship has led to much reduce performance and limit the possibility of improvement in the future of the Navy.
"Rheinland-Pfffalz" weighs 1500 tons of weight that is said to be twice twice as much as the Germans used during World War II.
In addition to hardware failure, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is serious.
The project is said to have been counted as a significant number of times $33,1 billion ($3,6 billion) -- while the original estimate was 2602 billion.
The latest lead-up of the axis ship became especially important, in recent context, there are warning of the German Navy power that's getting narrower.
Early this year Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Congress's National Office, acknowledged that the Navy has indeed "the ship of war capable."
It says that the issue is getting worse during time, because the old ship has stopped working but has no alternative.
He complains that none of the Baden-Werttemberg ships are qualified to join the Navy.
The National Trust Organization hears a secret life of bats.
A new study is being conducted in an area in Scotland in order to reveal how bats use nature's views to hunt food.
Hopefully, these findings will shed light on the behavior of animals who have these unique, uniquely lively lively, and direction for future survival.
This study was followed by scientists in National Trust for Scotland who followed the course of popular bats, bats, bats, pinopistelles, brown bats, and Daubenton bats in the Oveewe region of Western Ross.
A special recording will be placed in important locations around the research site to track down the activities of these bats during the season.
NIS and volunteers will also conduct cell phones with hand-sized tracking devices.
Sound analysisr will carry out all of the audio recordings and determine the sound frequency of bats and the purpose of every particular bat.
Then map and report the living environment of bats will be established to have a detailed picture of the nature of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS's natural guardian counselor, hopes that the outcome will help determine what life zone has the most important role in bats and animals who live in that environment.
This information will help to determine the benefit of life management activities, such as cultivating grass and the best way to preserve the forest for bats and other related species.
The bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have been greatly reduced during the past century.
They were threatened by construction activities and developed an impact on bat's beans and lost the environment.
The wind and light system, flies paper, some chemical process for building materials, as well as the attacks of a baby cat can cause risks to bats.
Steadman's not totally blind.
However, by the habit of hunting at night, ears are more beneficial than their eyes when they lie down and catch.
They use a very sophisticated echoing technique to determine the obstacles on the fly.
NARS is responsible for over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 7,05,000 lands throughout the country, and especially value bats.
There are ten trained professionals who regularly carry out surveys, reviews, and sometimes participate in animal rescue.
This organization even founded the first bats and only Scotland's soil in Dumfries and Galloway, this is the home of eight of Scotland's ten bats.
Land management, David House management, is their ideal territory.
"Treve is a wonderful environment for bats," he said.
"We have many old buildings, many trees and good lives.
But there's still a lot of mystery about bats, so the work here and in other facilities will help us understand what bats need to grow more."
He emphasized the importance of examining bat's life before being preserved in the soils, because in an attempt to destroy their steroids, they could have killed 400 children and children, almost destroyed the entire family.
Batman is a protected species and killing, harassing, annoying, or destroying their beans is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrrell, Scoordinator of Scotland, encouraged the community to join.
She said, "We still need to learn more about bats and many species, we can't know how far their bodies are apart."
Ronaldo rejected rape charges and his lawyer prepared the case of Germany’s German magazine.
Cyro Ronaldo said that sexual charges against him were false and that someone wanted to take advantage of your age.
Your lawyer is about to file Der Spzy's German newspaper for reporting this charge.
Portuguese money is now playing for Juventtus Group who was charged with rape of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
The Dr. Spyull gave the news on Friday: This player was supposed to pay this woman 375,000 dollars to keep the case quiet.
In a live video on Instagram before 142 million people watching for hours after the charge was announced, Ronaldo, 33 years old, confirmed it's a false statement.
"No, no, no.
What they say today's all fake news, "The fifth player is called a gold ball that speaks before the camera."
"They want to take advantage of my age to profit.
That's normal.
My name is famous, but it's also part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine, and I'm all right, "Fighter and smile."
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to file Japan's newspaper Der Spuder SFT on this charge, they call it "the doubt of private life."
Christian Schertz said that this player would ask for "the moral damage in terms of the amount that corresponds to the severity of violation, perhaps one of the most serious violations of individual rights in recent years."
The charge was assumed that in June 2009, at a high school room at Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting the club, Ronaldo and Mayorga were told to come back to this player's room, according to the file file at the Clark County Court, Nevada, he was accused of rapeing her at the hotel.
Mayorga said that Ronaldo was on his knees after the accused and said that he "99 %" was "good," only "1%" was bad.
There is a document that Ronaldo confirmed that both parties had sexual relations, but it was based on agreement.
Mayorga also said that she had been to the police station and was taken back to the hospital wounds, but then she agreed to compromise outside the court because she was "resolved" and worried because of "mursed by public shame."
This 34-year-old woman says that she is now trying to reverse her decision to settle before because she continues to suffer from the charges.
At the time of the charges given, Ronaldo was preparing from Manchester Unite to Real Madrid, but at the end of this summer, he moved to play with the Italian giant Juve in his deal of exchange for 100 million dollars.
Mr. Brext: You'll always regret 'cause you lost your car producer.
The secretary of Greg Clark said: "The Kingdom of England will forever regret" if he lost the world's leader of producing a back-up car.
He also added that it would be rather "respoilt" when Toyota needed to share with them that if you left the European Union without any further agreement, they would stop producing at the factory in Ostaston, near the U.S.A.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
Japanese car producer says that slowing down at the border in case Brext doesn't have a deal can lead to a loss of work.
The Medeston plant - the site of producing Aureis and Avetaensis of Toyota - produced nearly 5,000 of them last year, in which 90 percent were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My point is that if you completely left the European Union at the end of March, we'll have to stop producing at this factory," said Mr. Cooke, director of Toyota at Whiston.
Other automators in England are also concerned about leaving EU without a trade agreement across the border, including Hondda, BMW and Jaguar Land RU.
For example, BMW says they'll close the Mini factory at Oxford in a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car producers is the risk of supply chain in case Brext doesn't have another deal.
Toyota's production chain works according to the rule "just-in-time" rule, with all the sides provided in the United Kingdom and the European Union delivered after every 37 minutes for the car produced in order.
If you leave EU without another agreement on February 29,03, you may be able to interrupt at the border, and this industry is concerned that you can lead to delay and failure.
Toyota says that this company can't keep much money in store for a day at the Petroshire plant, so they're going to have to stop producing.
Mr. Clark said that General Chequers' plans of Prime Minister Theresa May give their relationship with the European Union in the future will be "surveded properly to avoid checking at the border."
"We need a deal, we want to have the best deal, not only to make a success today, but also to make sure we hold this opportunity," he said in the Today Book Four.
"The witness from Toyota as well as other car producers shows that we need to make sure we continue the supply of success."
Toyota has not yet announced how long the production will cease, but their long-term judgment is warned that extra costs will reduce the ability to reduce factory competition and at last, the worker will lose his job.
Peter Tsovellaris has worked at Strastons for 24 years and has been a call of Unitede union at the factory, showing that his members have been concerned: "In my experience once when I lost this job, I never had it again.
"We have built an accurate and reliable plan for our relationship with the European Union in the future."
White House announces the meeting between TTBlD and Mr. faithstein may be delayed.
The White House reported on Sunday: The high school meeting of TT. Donald P.P.P. P.P.P.P.A. with the General Rod wickednesssteinstein can be "a week" when the struggle for the candidate at the Supreme Court's Supreme Court of Kovanaugh is on the way.
This is Robert Mueller, who is investigating the intervention in the Russian election, linked between the assistants of TT. Pop and Russia and the possible president of the president's ability to prevent justice from being performed.
It's hard to act independently of the vice president's release or not, but it's been hard for Mueller to act independently, which has raised many Washington rumors for months.
Early this month, The New York Times delivered a report on hearing earphones to record conversations with CPPs and the debutation of the president through Project 25.
This is not what Mr. Mr. President, Mr. President.
But last Monday, he went to the White House between rumors that he was about to resign.
Instead, his meeting with President Cyp - who was visiting the United Nations Assembly in New York - was scheduled on Thursday.
President Pop said, "Do not want," "not want to fire Housestein but the meeting was delayed to avoid conflict with the hearing of the Senate committee between Kavnaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse that stood up.
On Friday, President Supp has asked the FBI to spend a week investigating charges against Kavanaugh, and he continues to delay the full vote of the Senate.
President's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting of Mr. Andlerstein, she said: "The day of the meeting is not yet determined, it may be this week, which can see why for this delay is because other problems are going on in the Supreme Court.
But soon we will receive news and the press will be updated."
Some reporters may disagree with that statement: Sanders has not held a press meeting at the White House since October 10th.
Chris Wallace's director asked you about this.
Sanders said that missing press meetings is not because of the media's "stresssing things," although she once said, "I also agree that real reporters are a lot of stories."
Then she suggested that further direct communication between President Pop and the press.
"The president is now doing many more requests than any previous president," she added without giving the testimony: "We've considered the number of press conferences."
Sanders said there would still be press conferences but if the press had a chance to ask the President directly, it would be much better to talk to me.
We've tried a lot, and you've also seen that we have to do a lot of jobs for the past few weeks, which will replace a press conference when you can talk directly to the President of America."
President Conves often answered questions when he left the White House or when he attended meetings open or during the press conferences when he visited.
Simple press conferences are often rare.
This week, in New York, the president was supposed to declare why but he suddenly appeared to have a strange form of reporters before the crowd.
The Secretary of Health wrote to European Union staff working in Scotland medical science to talk about the fear of Brexit.
The Secretary of Health wrote to European Union members who work in medical science in Scotland to express their appreciation for the country and expect the employees to remain behind Brexit.
Secretary Jeane Freeman sent a letter with a message that would resign within six months as soon as the United Kingdom was removed from the European Union.
The Scotland government pledges to support the expenses of the Witnesses who are in the European Union who are now working in the service that has been delivered.
In his letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In this summer, the exchange between England and the European Union of the British Union has continued to happen, and the decision will be taken in this fall.
But the British government is also promoting preparation for the script that may not be able to achieve a deal.
I know this is a bad time for all of you.
That's why I want to repeat that now I appreciate the contribution of each employee, no matter what their nationality is.
Moreover, colleagues from European Union have brought valuable experiences and skills to strengthen and improve health services, which also benefit our patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home, and we'd love you to stay."

Foreigners buy real estate in England get higher taxes.
Foreigners buy real estate in England will be taxier, and this added amount will be used to help homeless follow Tory's new policy.
This change will turn out to succeed in attempting to attract young Corbyn's young gesture.
The increasing of taxes applies to tax collectors in Britain.
This policy finance will increase to 120 million pounds a year - to help homeless people.
The foreigns buy real estate in England will receive higher tax charge -- this added money will be used to help homeless people, Prime Minister Theresa May will be announced today.
This change will result in a successful attempt to appeal to Jeremy Corbyn's young gesture with a commitment to provide a home with a better house and to target high income.
Adding taxes will apply to individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in England, this added amount of money will move government efforts to fight the current state of depression.
More than the current tax level, which includes higher tax levels were published two years ago for the second house and the purchase house just so that--it could go up to three percent.
The predictment of this change will increase to 120 million pounds a year.
It's estimated that 13 percent of the newly built real estate in London has been sold to people who are not English citizens, which is making homes high and makes homes that first buy more difficult.
Many rich areas of the country -- especially in the capital -- have become a ghost town, because most people abroad buy their homes for most of their time in another country.
New policy was given only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to help many young people with the opportunity to own their first home.
He accused the building companies to hold high real estate by taking the land but not using it, he called the Prime Minister May to give up the cost of having the price of holding the house in England.
Mr. Corbyn also published a series of house reforms that were designed to appeal to people, including control of rent and end the launch of "no error."
He also wanted to give congregations more power to build a new home.
She says, "I said last night that I would save my assignment to restore England's dream-- that life would be better for the new generation.
And that means that we have to get the market back in a lot of chaos right now.
You'll always open the door to people who want to live, work, and build lives here.
This does not mean, however, that people who are not living in England and companies in foreign lands can easily buy homes like English citizens.
For so many people, the dream of owning a house has become too far and the delay is still very big."
Jack: 'My last hope is to lead the Scotland team.'
The boss of Sunderland, Jack Ross said that his last hope was to be the manager of the Scotland team at some point.
Scots, 42 years old, faces the challenge of rebirthing the north club, now holding the third position in the League One, less than three points compared to first place.
He moved to a light stadium this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the University of Scotland last summer.
"I'd like to fight for my country as a player.
I had a hat with a B letter, and that's what I wanted, "Ross said to Sportsound of Scotland.
"My childhood months are linked to Scotland's games in Hampden with my father, and that's always what makes me remember.
However, that opportunity would only come if I succeeded in managing the club."
Sunderland's secret managers, Ross, include Dick Advoat, David Moyes, Sam Allardce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Canio.
Former coach Alloa Athlster says that he was not under pressure when he was next to the great names at such a big club, before he refused the offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Can I bring the club back to the Premier League Club now?"
And the system and the material facilities at this club must be part of Premier League League, "He said."
"This isn't an assignment to achieve it easily, but I just consider myself successful if I can get the club back into the tournament."
Ross had three years as manager, after a while as manager at Dumbarton and 15 months of training at Hets.
Later, he helped Alloa to restore position after falling off the third class, and he took St. Miren from the risk of falling into the next season champion.
Ross says he's now very comfortable in his career of playing football atacol, Falkik, Streren, and young Academical.
"It's probably a real turning point," he recalls in the role of Alloa's leading.
"I really believe that I'm perfectly compatible with my manager's role rather than a player.
This may seem strange because I've been quite successful, have good income and achieved certain successs when I was a player.
But the game is often not easy.
There's a lot of things you have to face every week.
I still have to endure stress and pressure from work, but I feel satisfied with my management work.
I've always wanted to do management work, and now I'm doing it, I'm most comfortable being myself in my entire adult life."

The summer heat has increased the money for the bars in England, but it has added pressure to the restaurants.
According to the material, bars and bars have witnessed the increase in incomes, 2,7% in July but business at restaurants has reduced 4,8%.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business counsel firm, has combined the amount of data, said: "The longer and the British recruits in the World Cup tend to sell the goods of July, like June 6, when bars increase 2,8%, the restaurants are much more powerful.
It's going to be worse in restaurants down 1.8% in June, it's worse in July.
Bars and bars about drinks have the fastest growth in comparison to the dropoff level at restaurants.
Food bars are also affected by heat, although not as serious as restaurants.
Looks like everybody just wants to go to a drink.
There's six percent increase in the month while the food trade is sold at the bars and the bar is handled."
“ These results show the trend that we have seen since late April, ” says Paul Newman, an expert at the entertainment industry and the RMSS Hotel.
The weather and impact of social events or sports are still the biggest factors in the business at restaurants.
It's no surprise that restaurants continue to be in trouble, business reduced 4.8% less than the same year before, while the pressure of the cost continues again.
The long hot summer of sun has taken place at the worst time for food providers, regardless of whether in August the weather is going to improve the present situation."
The total growth of business at bars and restaurants, including new locations, is 2,7% in July, reflecting the writing on the performance.

Advertisers refer to mothers with milk that divide their argument over the Internet.
A child’s mother-smashing company that divides the online opinion with ads that compare mothers to milked cows.
In order to mark the visible appearance of the product as "the milk milk can wear and not cause the world's first noise," the world's consumer technology produced an inspired commercial that was inspired by sound music to show the freedom that a newly attracted machine would bring to its mothers.
Four mothers jumped in a barn full of grassed grass, followed a song saying: "Yes, I milk my milk on my own, but you don't see any tails and "In case you don't realize, this isn't my breasts, they are my breasts."
Go on, "I'm milking milk, sucking milk, I'm feeding kids, smoking milk, sucking milk, I'm milking milk for my girls."
This commercial, however, was posted on the Facebook page of the company, which caused many discussions online.
With 7,000,000 watchings and hundreds of comments, this video has received a lot of side effects from the audience, many ideas that this commercial commercial commercial is critical to the "threficious" of the milk industry.
"A bad decision to use cattle to promote this product.
Like us, they had to get pregnant and bear children to produce milk, except for the cattle were taken from the parent in a few days after they were born "a writer."
Elvie milk tubes are in her chests for milk. (Elvie/M)
Another said, "This could cause mental damage to both mother and child.
Yes, why don't you use a commercial commercial for milking mothers who are giving suck?
Another said, "This charge has nothing to do with this."
Some of the same advertising guard, a woman admitted that she saw the song "very funny."
"I think this is a unique idea.
I'll give myself one if I'm still giving you a baby.
The practice of milk really makes me feel like a cow.
This is kind of crazy, but I understand its message.
This is a unique product," someone else noted.
Another said, "This is an interestingd commercial that toward mothers who need milk (at work or in the bathroom) and they feel like "The bull."
This isn't a compliment or evaluation of milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they danced with the milk source that was hidden in their underwear.
The idea behind this campaign is, in fact, that many women suck milk so that they say they feel like cattle.
However, the Elvie milking machine does not cause noise, no string or pipe, and is carefully placed inside the breast of the baby’s breast, helping women free to move, hold the baby, and even walk out when they are smoking.
Ana Balarin, his partner and ECD at Mother comments: "The milk of Elvie is indeed a revolution product, worthy of a bold and inspiring introduction to curiosity.
When we compare women with milk, we want people to know about the product of milk and related challenges, and we also display a pleasant and understanding of the freedom that new milk products bring to their mothers.
This is not the first time the Elvie milk plant appeared on the headlines.
During the London fashion week, a mother and two of her mothers showed up on the Mata Jakubowski floor when using this product.
Hundreds of children moved quietly to a tent in Texas border.
The number of Witnesses in prisons has increased, although the number of people who have been out of the monthly border has almost not changed, part of the reason and policy of the Grep administration has caused the process of leading children to the donors to become more difficult.
According to traditional tradition, most of the donors who were once immigrants had no papers, and they were concerned that accepting a native child could affect their ability to stay in America.
The risk in June, when federal governments announce that potential donors and other adults in their families will have to take prints and print prints, and this data will be shared with the mobile organs.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Ditrotics, witnessed before the United Nations that this agency had arrested tens of thousands of people who applied for funding children who had no guardians.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those who had never had a criminal record.
"For 80 percent of the donors or members of the donor’s family are here illegal, and most of them have a criminal record.
So we're continuing to judge these individuals," said Albence.
According to the employees working at refugees camps, to be able to deal quickly with these children, the authorities have given new laws that require some donors to appear in court within a month of captivity, instead of after 60 days, as before.
Many will appear through the video conference call, rather than in person, to justify their legal rights before a respiratory judge.
Those judging were not qualified enough for assistance that would be launched quickly.
The longer they are held, the longer they become anxious or depressed, this can lead to violent acts or trying to escape, according to local refugees and according to reports from the system in recent years.
Those with support indicated that increasing anxiety at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where they see a child in trouble who has a lot of possibilities to be ignored by the scale of large camps.
They add that taking children to the city with refugees is not enough time for them to prepare for a mental setting or to say goodbye to friends who may be causing mental damage that many are suffering.
Syria suggested that the U.S., France, France, and Turkey draw out of the country immediately.
In front of the United Nations Council, Secretary Walid al-Marle also called the Syrian refugees back to their country, even though the civil war had gone to the eighth year.
Moulem, vice president, said that foreign forces were on illegal Syria lands, in the name of an anti-multal force, so "will be handled."
"They had to get rid of Syria without condition and immediately," he said before the council.
Moule emphasized that "the war against Syria has reached its end," now more than 360,000 people who have died since 2011, with millions who have left their home.
He said Damascus would continue "The war in this holy war until we were sealed out of all Syria" and "the illegal presence of foreign forces."
Now, there are about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, trained and advisers for all the Kurrd and the Arabs who objected to President Genesisar al-Assad.
More than 1,000 soldiers in the country are being destroyed by war.
About the problem of refugees, Moulem said that the state once had been good enough for them to return, and he blamed for "some Western countries" had "solvent the unstained fear" to turn the refugees back.
"We've called the international community and humanitarian organizations for the refugees to come back," he said.
"They're using political cards for humanitarian issues."
And the European Union warned that there would be no return aid for Syria until there was a political deal between Assad and opposing sides to end the war.
The U.N.I.A. state that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey was about to establish a neutral area in the last rise zone of Idlib which created a chance to move political negotiations.
A deal between Russia and Turkey has prevented a massive assault on the Russian forces of Syria that have been in conflict with this province, where three million people are living.
Moulem emphasized, however, that this agreement has an "a certain time" and expressed hope that military action would target the holy elements of war included soldiers from the Nusra Front, which are the objects that will be deleted.
The members of the United Nations of Stifan de Mistura will soon call their first meetings of the new committee including government and opposing members to prepare a resolution after the war for Syria and open the way for the election.
Moule placed conditions for the participation of Syria’s government into this committee, saying that the service of the committee was limited to "see the terms of the operation" and warned against disobedience to votes.

Graham Dorrans' optimism is in front of the team before the encounter with Rapid hội
Fears fought Rapid Vienna on Thursday when they learned that victory over Austria, after the impressive peace in Spain before Villarreal earlier this month, would give them the advantage to take into the GSPUR's panel.
The knee wound had prevented Graham Dorrans for the first time in the season until the second season with Villarreal, but he believed that it would be possible to use that for better things.
"It's a good thing for us because Villarreal is a strong team," said 31-year-old player.

We could have won at the end of the match, but the peace rate was also a bad result.
They may well have played better in the first round, but we've been engaged in two rounds and had better styles.
Next Thursday, it's going to be an important fight in Europe.
I hope we can win three points, but that's going to be a tough fight because they've had good results in the previous fight, but with the support of the fans, I'm sure we can get through and win good results.

Women are so worried that they lose sleep because of retirement problems.
Even though researchers are well aware of what they care about, few people communicate with family members.
About half of those who attended Nationwide studies reported that they spoke with their husbands or husbands about the cost of long-term care.

Talk to your wife and children: You cannot prepare your mind for your family so that they will take care of you if you do not display your desires first.
Communicate with your adviser and family to discuss where and how to take care, since such choices may be an important factor to determine the cost.
Bring your financial advisers: Your counselor can also help you to provide the appropriate payment method for those costs.
Your financial choices for long-term care may include traditional health policy, health insurance policy, cash policy, cash insurance to help cover these costs or buy insurance on your own -- as long as you have money.
Prepare well for legal documents: Avoid legal wars that may occur.

"Syfullfullo Habullellavic falseov has caused damage, damage, and loss of family and friends for Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleuves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Canalco Erlij, Herrruchi, Hernanda Menza, and Alejanenco's sister, followed the court's announcement.
The victim was a tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South York District was executed.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder two drug providers but eventually sentenced to death in September 2009.
The last time the execution was carried out in a federal case in New York City was in 1953 for the reason that a married couple were executed after they were accused of being a spy on the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years ago.
His wife and his wife were executed in a electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Nupov, a native of UAR, did not display regret after the attack, according to court document.
He declared to the researchers that he felt fine about what he did, the police told him.
Wrongov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform an attack after watching ISIS video on the phone, in a condition.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, the police told me.
He didn't confess to a 22-year-old criminal statement.
David Patton, one of the federal defense attorneys representing Wrongpov, said that they were "a perfect hope" with the decision of the prosecutor.
"We think that the decision to execute death instead of accepting a confession against a life sentence without the possibility of release will only extend the damage of this event to those involved," Patton said.
Wrongpov's defense team had asked the prosecutors not to give death sentence.

'No more people would agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition would not vote for this plan, which would usually not happen to our party, our work worker, who would call for support from the people and vote for us from the beginning.
Let's give up the Chequers plan and listen to the people.'
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: "The prime minister keeps his chair when they keep promise to the people."
Farage said that politicians had to participate in the ceremony so that they could receive the heat if they changed the decision given in the Democratic requirements of 2016.

'They're trying to give up Brext and we're here today to say 'We won't let you do it'.'
In a message to those who support him, he adds: 'I want to let the political class, who's trying to change Brexiet, feel the heat of the current situation.

A aunt in New York Nanny sued a couple who had fired her from her treatment after she had missed a false message from her mother complaining that she was "a black man."
The couple refused them to be eccentricists, considering the case as a "stircle."

Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, was born immediately after the book was accepted widely, the letter said: "It's hard to put yourself in someone else's position when reading the book was first published.
It's amazing now that we know about the great success of Paddington."
When he spoke about his father, a film writer for the Tower before she was inspired to write the book for children from a small play bear, he was still very optimistic when his work was rejected, she shared more on the anniversary of 60 years of publishing a book, which was a "Contract" after his death last year.
When she spoke of Paddington, she described as "a very important member of our family," she said, adding her father always to be proud of his success.
"You're a pretty depressed man, and he's not a man who's not an explosion, "You say.
"But Paddington actually exists with him, it's almost like you have a child and it's been successful: you're proud of them even when they don't actually exist.
I think you've been watching Paddington's operations that way.
Although it was the product of his creative imagination and imagination, he always took a certain position for Paddington."

And I did.
I said, "Ishi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll see you soon.
I'll always be with you.
The doctors pumped heart support and pulled the tube out of her body.
She stopped breathing a few times and this is the last time.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this still hasn't closed.
I can't cry or cry or cry because I'm with my family and everyone.
I must be the one linking them."
At last, Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning by her daughter’s departure, was on a plane with other passengers who faced the challenge that she would have to pass.

The grieving woman posts a note to stop suicides in the bridge.
Two women have been killed by suicide relatives trying to prevent others from stealing their own lives.

Ms. Davis’s son, Tyler, was 13 when she was 13 years old and had to endure depression and killed herself at the age of 18.

Davis, 45 years old, living in Lydney, says that her son was a promising cook with funny laughter.
"We all know about it because of the smile.
They used to say his smiles light every room."
However, it left his job before he killed himself because he saw himself "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, left just like his brother after he finished his life.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be a chain reaction."
Ms. Davis designed cards, "to let people know that there are always people that you can meet, talk, or even make friends.
Don't live in silence - you need to talk."

"He didn't talk about feeling bored or disappointed or anything like that," she said.

The future of Kovanaugh is hanging while the FBI is starting to investigate
Flake said on Saturday: "I think, if we could actually get something like what he asked for -- a limited investigation of time, then we could collect a little bit, and he added that he was afraid that the committees would be put on the party's table."
Why would Mr. Kovanaugh and the Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their delay is just a matter of time.
The midterms that have spent five weeks, on November 6, if they were expected, the Republican members of the Republic are in very bad conditions that will be worse than they are in trying to find out who they want to be in the highest position.
George W. needed a call to the senators, operating the court to support Mr. Kovanaugh, who used to be the White House assistant under the time of President Bush, since then could be approached by his wife, Ashley, who was the personal secretary of President ways.
What happened after the FBI announced reports?
There will be a vote at the Senate where 51 of the Republicans and 49 of the Democratic Party will be held.
Not yet unknown whether Mr. Kavnaugh could receive at least 50 votes of the Senate, this allowed Mr. Mike Pence, now vice president, remove the button and confirm where the candidate is in the Supreme Court.
The number of Koreans escaped by the Golden Ages.
The Korean population fled hard since Kim Jong-un had been in charge seven years ago, a lawman in Korea spoke.
Park Bieug, quoting data from South Korea last year, reported that 1.127 escape escape - compared to 06 escape in 2011.
Mr. Park said that by tight control over the border between North Korea and China and the large percentage of merchants being arrested were the main factors of this change.
Leding didn't present public comments.
Most people who escaped from North Korea eventually received the Korean national training.
Seoul said that more than 3,000 North Koreans have been overcome since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people fled to China, as the world had the longest border with North Korea, and they could easily cross the Air Force.
China views refugees as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forced them to return home.
The relationship between North Korea and South Korea still has increased greatly during these last months.
Early this month, the leaders of the two countries met at PFO in order to have negotiations focused on non-inite problems.
These actions took place after a historical meeting in June of June, between the President of the United States and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, both of them agreed with extended terms to go to the nuclear Union to sell Korea.
But on Saturday, the Secretary of North Korea, Ri Yong-Ho blameed the United States's punishments that caused a delay in the process.
"If there's no confidence in the U.S., then there's no confidence in our national security and in the case, there's no other way that we're going to find our own solution," said Ri in a speech at the United Nations Council in New York.
Nancy Nemosi called Hassan Kovanaugh as "surred," and said he didn't fit his position at the Supreme Court.
The 19th - century Persian leader Nancy Clarosi called him for his position at the Supreme Court, Cretin Kovanaugh as "scretent" and said that he was in no proper position to serve at the Supreme Court.
Nemosi comments on an interview that took place on Saturday day at Texas Cortez in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but I think that if a woman has done that, they'll call it "Actroosi," said he about his reaction to Kavalaugh before the Senate Committee on Thursday.
Kavenaugh insisted that he attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kovanaugh expressed a lot of feelings, sometimes he nearly cried out and was told about his family and five months at high school.
He also strongly condemned the democracy before the committee, calling charges against him to be an action that was well - planned by "Actuitated" by the anger of Jogde who lost the election in 2016.
Nemosi said she believed that Kavnaugh's testimony proved that he was not suitable for position at the Supreme Court, for he clearly demonstrated his behavior against democracy.
"I think he removed his own identity when he gave his statements and his treatment when he spoke about the House of Mr. And the Democratic Party," she said.
Nemosi refused to be asked if she tried to accuse Kavaugh if he was confirmed, and if the democracy won the majority of votes in the House.
"I'd say this -- if he didn't tell Congress or FBI, then he'd not only be in position at the Supreme Court but he'd have to present before the court," said Cortrosi.
Kavnaugh is now a judge at the D.C. Court.
Petromosi adds, as a member of the Democratic Party, she is interested in the possibility of Kavanaugh's ability to make a decision against the law of health care, fit money, or Roe v. Wade, because he's considered a judge.
In the ceiling, Kovanaugh walked away from the question about whether he changed some decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This isn't the time for someone who's too excited, who's located in court, and hopefully we'll say, 'This isn't great,' said Petriosi.
Women need to know how to use it.
This is really a heavy criticism, month after month, year after year, more anger than it was, and she couldn't overcome without crying.
"We cried when we were angry," said Miss Steinem to me after 45 years.
"I don't think that's unusual, and you?"
She goes on, "I've been helped by a very helpful woman, she's the senior director, she said she was crying when she was angry but to make her reaction when she was angry and started crying, she would say to someone you were talking to, "You can think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And she kept crying.
And I think this is great."
You are allowed to cry for this behavior as part of a way out of anger because they are basically confused.
One of my most profound memories when I was working at the company first was that it was a place for men, I was crying when there was a burning anger, which was when I was hit by an elderly woman -- that was the cold manager who always made me afraid -- that I was dragged into the stairs.
She said to me, "Don't ever let them see you cry."
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and satisfied because they're with you."
That's how you've been working with Gary Hart in your campaign for President's election.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an affair on a boat called Melly Business and was left of the race, she was deeply disappointed that there was no reason for her not to stand for president.
30 years later she laughed and said to me, "It's not a wise decision."
"There are seven other candidates in the race, and they need another candidate.
Someone called this race "The White Snow White and Seven Kingdoms."
As late as the campaign, she was lost during the fund strike, so she swore that she wouldn't join the campaign unless she had won 2 million dollars.
The war has failed.
She found out that some of her supporters gave her 250 dollars instead of 1,000 dollars from America to support male candidates.
You wonder, "Do they think I'm reduced?"
When she declared that she would not launch an official operation, she was able to overcome her feelings of appreciation for her people who supported her, disappointed with the hard system of funding and aiming for the election than the delegates, who were more angry with her being separated from sex - that she had come to her senses.
"You can think that I've lost my nerve," she recalls the way the press responded to me.
