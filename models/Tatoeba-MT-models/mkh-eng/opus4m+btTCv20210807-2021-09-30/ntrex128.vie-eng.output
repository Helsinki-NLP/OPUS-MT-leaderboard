The Welsh Congressional Representative (AM) is worried about 'as a mess'
There is a certain concern of a number of congressional representatives concerning the change of their title to MWP (Swiss of the Wales Parliament).
The issue was raised by plans to change the name of parliament to the Wales Parliament.
Congressional delegates on the scene worried that this could be a problem of disproportionate opinion.
A Labour Party Representative said his party was concerned that the word would be pronounced with Twp and Pwp.
For non-Mexican readers: In Wales, twp means temporary and pwp means feces.
A Stripe Party Representative states that the whole Party is not proud - and proposes other names.
A Conservative Party Representative shared his party - there was no prejudice - about changing the name, but did not forget to mention how the MWP stands to become Muppet.
The Welsh word w is pronounced in the same way as the British Yorkshire letter.
The Congressional Commission is currently drafting a bill concerning the change of name, stating that the final decision on any identifiable identification of the National Assembly members would of course be a concern for the MPs themselves.
The Wales Government Act of 2017 empowers the Welsh parliament to be renamed by itself.
In June, the Committee announced the results of a referendum on proposals to seek a consensus basis for the name of parliament as the Welsh Parliament.
Considering the title story of Congressional MPs, the Commission on Appeals of the Wales Parliament or the WMP, but the results of the referendum indicate the trend toward Parliamentary Parliament of Wales.
Congressional delegates are publicly offering other options, but efforts to achieve consensus may be a concern for Electoral Committee chief, Elin Jones, who is tasked with submitting a draft amendment in the coming weeks.
The draft amendment will include other changes to the way Congress operates, including rules from Congress to design the government.
Congressional delegates will give final votes to the question what they should be renamed when they offer suggestions on the amendment bill.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on national name change
Elections voted Sunday on whether they would change their name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
Comprehensive voting was set up in an attempt to resolve decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long confirmed that the name of its northern neighbor corresponds to its own territory and has repeatedly opposed being members of the EU and NATO of your country.
President Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, a member of the counter-transmitter about the change of national name, has announced he would repeal the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said the change in the brand was the cost to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Cathedral Bells Down When Deaths Come Out at Harlem
“Historically, the elders I have been exposed to share that every corner of the street has a bar and a church,” Adams said.
Today, there is no church without a bar.
He found that the disappearance of bars was acceptable.
He said that people today have many ways to communicate.
Bars are no longer public living rooms where people go back often.
As for the churches, he was concerned that the money from the sale of assets would not be as sustainable as the leaders expected - and sooner or later all would return at the starting line -
He added that these churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with many of the apartments of the locals, which would not help to preserve local respect.
He added: “A small part of those who buy apartments in those apartments will be whites, and then the prospect of closed churches coming faster than ever because there is no reason that the residents of those apartments will become laypeople here.”
Both churches were built by white corps before Harlem became a city for black people - the Metropolitan Community in the 1870s, becoming St. Martin's a decade later.
The first white curators moved in the 1930s.
A group of nearby worshipers took over the site.
St. Martin's has been taken over by a black corps under the administration of Bishop John Howard Johnson, who leads a boycott of retailers on 125 Street, a shopping mall street in Harlem, who opposes renting or urging people to color.
A 1939 fire caused the building to be badly damaged, but when Father Johnson's lay people planned to rebuild, they set the bells.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell - the bell of the poor -
The expert who controls the ring in July preferentially called it \"a cultural treasure\" and \"an invariable historical treasure.\"
The expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world’s first ring of bells played by a color musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who pursued a larger bell at Riverside Cathedral 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's did not replace him.
What happened at St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complex story of architects and contractors, some of whom have been brought up by lay leaders in the church, others by the Diocese.
Diocese management - parish regulators, including lay leaders - referred to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese - would seek to transfer costs - to the diocese regulator, although they were not involved in hiring architects and contractors mentioned.
Some lay people are unhappy with the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Sharks attack 13-year-old baby scuba diving in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving in California on Saturday, the first day of the shrimp catch, authorities said.
It happened just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's coast in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he was driving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy's cry for help and then all went out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a good cry when he caught the shrimp, but then he -- he realized that the boy was crying, \"I was bited!
I was bited . . .
All of the boy's bones were exposed - Hammel noticed as soon as he arrived at the boy.
“I told everyone to get out of the water immediately: ‘There’s sharks there,’” Hammel added.
He was moved by plane to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was in critical condition.
The shark's name is the perpetrator of the attack that has not been identified.
Rescuers, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that they found a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but they determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered a serious injury in his upper body.
Officials shut down beach entrances from Ponto Sea in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas within 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles revealed that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the region, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's UK Beauty Market
Sainsbury's is pushing for Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams with traditional beauty stalls, where there are always help professionals.
As part of the massive push into the £2.8 billion beauty market, which is continuing to grow while the sales of fashion goods and household appliances decline, the larger beauty booths will be tested at 11 stores nationwide and will be replicated in more stores next year if there are positive signs.
Investment in beauty goods comes as supermarkets seek ways to take advantage of alternative stalls for TV stalls, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it first doubled its beauty product size to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Available brand chains such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space and branding areas similar to how to show up in the store like at Boots.
The supermarket is also reinforcing its Boutique makeup line so that the majority of products are plant-based - which is increasingly sought by young customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the discount at Sainsbury’s, the first store opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second store opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and turning to buying small amounts of daily food at local convenience stores means that supermarkets are more passionate about attracting customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the stalls would be more and more similar to department stores as supermarket chains tried to cope with incentives from Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and goods.
Sainsbury's, which has put Argos's stalls in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitats counters since they bought both brand chains two years ago, which has boosted grocery sales and helped buy more lucrative ones.
The supermarket has previously tried to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical plates but failed.
Sainsbury's experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended after problems related to how to split revenues from commodities in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical goods to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds drug chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will be part of the plan, by strengthening a range of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of the beauty rows to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specialized training for employees who will directly offer advice.
Our wide range of brands are designed to fit every need and attractive environment as well as convenient locations which means that we are now an attractive stop, challenging the traditional way of shopping.
Peter Jones is ‘stretching’ after Holly Willoughby pulls out of a £11 million contract
Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones, was angry after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from her £11 million contract in her stylish branding to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their interior brand and Truly accessories.
The couple's business is called Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning’s 37-year-old program has been on Instagram to announce that she will leave.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den, which angered the star Peter Jones as she withdrew from their super-profit style business at the last minute - to focus on her own new fatty contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
During a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, sources said Jones had been -strong - when the show's gold girl admitted that her new contracts - worth £1.5 million - meant she had no time to devote to their interior brand and Truly accessories.
The business is considered Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is thought to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million asset.
When 37-year-old Willoughby landed on Instagram to announce that she would leave Truly, Jones quickly left the UK for one of her vacation homes.
One source said: “Truly is Holly’s top priority.
It should have been her long-term future that would have been with her for the next few decades.
Her decision to leave was amazing.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, a very close time to the launch.
There's a warehouse filled with goods at the Marlow headquarters ready to launch.
Experts believe this Morning’s departure, one of the UK’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions of dollars due to strong investments in products from cushions and candles to clothing and interiors, and the ability to back down at the time of its launch.
And that could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby’s mother and husband, Dan Baldwin, became close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple went on vacation together and Jones had 40% of the stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV host I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We’re not going to comment on his business.”
It’s so “I love each other deeply.”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider to be \"not to be in power\" for having seen good results about the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump speaks in a loud voice - the presenter -
I didn’t give up at all.
He mentioned that Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June when Trump praised it as a major step forward in denuclearization in North Korea.
But denuclearization talks have been stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, head of the North Korean Foreign Ministry, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not notice a satisfactory response - from the United States to North Korea's first arms removal moves.
Instead, he said the United States is continuing sanctions to increase pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his campaign speech.
“We’re doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
We will fight North Korea.
Millions of people could be killed.
We are in this good relationship now.
He said efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had a positive result - ending missile tests, helping free hostages, and bringing the remains of U.S. troops back home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to become president, but instead of 10,000 outsiders trying to step into this hard zone, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia destroy the island and kill people
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs said they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has gone missing, there is no statement of the national disaster given, a prerequisite to catalyze international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very definitive in not asking for international aid, so that’s very challenging,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children are gathering a group to travel to Palo, they are still not sure if foreign workers can work in the area.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palo to consider whether international agencies are allowed to contribute aid efforts.
Despite the constant earthquake that Indonesia has experienced, the country has not been well prepared for the anger of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, such places were not common in other locations.
Although the warning was effective, the lack of tsunami alerts in Palermo could potentially lead to human damage.
At peak times, moving between many of Indonesia’s islands was a challenge.
Disasters make logistics even more complex.
An ambulance train that has remained in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims who are seeking their way to Palermo, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the disaster.
President Joko Widodo turned the improvement of Indonesia’s old infrastructure into a center of his election campaign, and he wasted money on building roads and railways.
But financial deficits have made Joko’s administration difficult as he faces a re-election next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from tensions between sectarians that have not yet ended in Indonesia, as members of the majority of Muslims pursue a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were thrown out of their homes as Christian and Islamic gangs raided the streets, using knifes, bows, and other raw weapons.
Daniel Sturridge brings a draw for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat against Chelsea on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London with a goal in the 89th minute.
Sturridge took the pass from Xherdan Shaqiri in 30m from Chelsea when his team was leading 1-0.
He dealt with the ball with his left leg before launching a shot at the vertical column.
Responsibilities and towards the upper right corner of the frame.
The ball crossed the reach of Kepa Arrizabalaga and flew straight into the net.
“I’m simply standing in the right position, getting the ball and players including Shaq always trying to jump above, so I’m just trying to jump up,” Sturridge said on LiverpoolFC.com.
“I see Kante coming, so it’s a touch and a lot of hesitation.”
Chelsea led nearly half of the match after opening the score of Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
In this phase, the striker of the Royal Cavalry passed the ball to Mateo Kovacic before moving around the middle of the field and jumping to the part of Liverpool.
Kovacic had a wall turnover from the middle of the yard.
He had a beautiful teaspoon, heading to Hazard, who was heading to the forbidden area.
Hazard removed the line of defense and finished by left foot to the corner of the field, crossing Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
The match between Liverpool and Naples in the Champions League group stage will take place at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at UEFA Europa Leaguge on Tuesday afternoon in London.
Damage to Indonesian tsunami reached 832.
The number of people killed in an earthquake and wave in Indonesia rose to 832, the National Disaster Center announced early Sunday.
A lot of people are reported to have been trapped in the ruins of buildings brought by the 7.5-degree earthquake on Friday, bringing waves up to 20 feet high, according to spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho of the center shared at the press conference.
The city of Palo, home to more than 380,000 people, is submerged in the ruins of buildings.

The statue of Cromwell of Congress becomes the latest memorial to bear the story of 'rewritten history'
Exclusion would be like the poetry of justice for the Taliban's destruction of many monks who followed him, as they destroyed countless British architectural and religious works.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick’s words as “crazy and effort to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, said: “Inevitably the debate over leaving the statues of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace will become the center of the present.
The symbol of civil wars in England is not ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell was wrong because of his parents’ actions in the last century.
Cromwell’s representative, William Hamo Thassycroft, is proof of 19th-century opinion and is part of the history of a character that many believe is still worthy of.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Perhaps, by the end of the 19th century, Cromwell was seen as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his mind, of course.
Whether it’s a perfectly accurate example for the topic in the ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict between the 17th century has shaped the next development of our country and Cromwell is a typical figure in division.
His achievements as God’s protector are also worthy of honor and recognition.
The killing of Chinese farmers.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southwestern Chinese market, according to local media.
The man, known as \"Yuan\" was found dead with the broken arteries, the entire body of the blood in near a cage in the market in Chua Suzhou Province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig breeder prepares to inject a pig vaccine in an operating furnace on 30 May 2005 in Tay Ninh, Qinghai Province, China.
He is said to be moving with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, the cousin discovered that he had died, and saw a door of the pig’s cage open next to him.
He said in the cage was a huge male pig with blood stains around the groin.
The report of a forensic examination confirmed that 550 pounds of pig attacked farmers to death.
My brother's legs were covered with blood and no longer intact - the cousin known as \"Wu\" said on Guiyang Evening News.
Photos from the security camera show Yuan arrived at the market around 4.40 a.m. to feed pigs.
After about an hour, he was found dead.
The killer pig is not a pig in the pigs of the two brothers.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking another person, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market regulator are said to be negotiating compensation for his death.
Although not common, the case of pigs attacking people was previously recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, causing her husband to be seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig beat a Welsh farmer into his tractor until his wife threatened the animal to flee.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the smell of blood can serve as a \"stretch\"
They just want to be close.
They're curious, they're curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just need to love them in the right direction,” he said.
The surplus of Hurricane Rosa carries heavy rain across the southwestern United States
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakened as on its way to colder waters at the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry heavy rains across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa has a wind strength of 85 mph, a Feast 1 storm, as of 05:00 AM Eastern Sunday, and is determined 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure began to form on the Pacific Ocean and moved east to the West Bank of the United States. As Rosa approached the Baja California Peninsula on Monday when it formed a tropical storm, it would start carrying more of the northern temperatures to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, low-pressure humidity will cause heavy rainfall to spread in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, the rainfall of 1 to 4 inches would cause dangerous floods, debris, and the ability to landslides in the desert.
Humid temperatures will cause rainfall to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour at peaks, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona regions.
The rainfall is expected to reach 2 to 4 inches in the southwest, especially in the wide area of Arizona.
The scans can occur when the situation worsens quickly due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
The situation would be extremely difficult if the risk of walking into the desert when there was a threat from tropical rain.
The heavy rains can make the gorges strong rivers and storms bring local winds and dust cyclones.
Low pressure will carry a number of local heavy rains on the coast of Southern California.
The total rainfall can reach more than half an inch, which is easy to cause sludge lines and sliding roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains began to pour into Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain became more common at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will hit Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
There may be some harsh temperature areas across the United States in October when the Arctic is colder, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant changes in temperatures in nearby localities.
A typical example of significant temperature differences in the central United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference is close to 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer warm while the consultation will be renewed and strengthened again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start in October with temperatures common in around 80 in Southern Plains to the Northeast.
New York City temperatures can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Long-term weather forecasts are showing the possibility of high temperatures above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people watched the hearing Thursday on six television systems by Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court candidate and the woman accused him of a sexual assault allegedly occurring in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, political impasse continues, with television outlets disrupting the regular broadcast with last-minute news on Friday: an agreement made by Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to investigate a week of allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to remove her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his calm move, said he was 100% sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched the hearing, according to Nielsen in the report on Friday.
The company has calculated average viewers on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Not included with other television stations including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has some problems when calculating viewers in the office.
In order to make a correlation, the number of audiences is similar to that of a final ticket match or an Academy Award.
The Fox News channel, which gave strong support for the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all stations at an average rate of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC ranks second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS with 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN are 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The concern remains huge after the hearing.
Flake is the central character in Friday’s noise.
After the Republican peaceman made a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was tracked by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning that he was screamed by protesters as he tried to move after the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes when he was questioned, televised directly on CNN.
“I’m standing in front of you,” a woman said.
Do you think he tells the truth to the whole country?
He was condemned to have power while too many women were incompetent.
Flake said before the elevator closed that his office had made a statement, that he would have much to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and television television stations coverage for hours directly after that, when the Judiciary Committee will have to vote on whether Brett Kavanaugh is nominated.
But Flake said he would only do so knowing that the FBI would consider allegations against candidates next week, something some of the minority Democrats have urged.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his fellow Democrat, Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and some senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was heavy, because it was clear that the Republican Party would not have a Kavanaugh approval vote without investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May Recounts ‘Political Songs’ to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May expressed criticism about his plans to leave the European Union as \"political\" to Britain's future and undermine national interests in a Sunday Times interview.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Meeting in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed his blow to their so-called Chequers deal on Brexit, arguing that the British and EU proposals should collect each other's tariffs -- completely absurd --
Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the murder shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained for second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials have released a video about the confrontation between Sims and Sims, and police said Sims had fallen in glass during the raid.
Police discovered glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on glasses, CBS' WAFB news agency said.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
The guarantee is set for $350,000, the lawyer said.
The Baton Rouge Area Diet Office published a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a bullet from the head to the neck.
The department is relying on Louisiana police, anti-evaporator forces, state police crime labs, Southern University Police and regional residents to assist in investigating the arrest.
The physical director of LSU Joe Alleva thanked the regional law agency for its sensitivities and pursuit of justice.
Sims is only 20 years old.
The 6-year-old striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 beats per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team had been hit and killed before Wayde's death.
Mr. Wade says: “That’s what you’ll always be watching.”
The volcanic ash goes into Mexico City.
Tropical discharges from the Popocatepetl volcano have flowed to the southern neighborhoods of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater operated and they recorded 183 emissions and ash within 24 hours.
The center has tracked many fluctuations and shakes.
Social media images show thin layers of ash that obscure car windscreens in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have seen an increase in volcanic activity 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, named Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with anti-violent police, when thousands of protesters marked the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote on secession.
A group of separatists wearing masks are held by anti-violent police with eggs and powder paints, causing dark dust clouds on the streets that are often crowded with tourists.
The war broke out at the end of the day when the police used the batons to suppress the crackdown.
For hours, the pro-independence oppositionists chanted: “Do not forget, do not forgive - against those who protest against the word,” “the great Spain.”
fourteen people were treated for mild wounds during the protests, according to local media reports.
Stress remains high in the region according to independent thinking a year after the October 1 referendum was considered illegal with Madrid but received by Catalan separatists.
Elections in an independent direction were overwhelming, though low support rates for anti-semitists largely boycotted the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote at polling sites in the region amid violent clashes.
The pro-Independent factionists camped through Friday night to stop a protest in support of national police.
The protest took place before but was forced to take place with other events.
Narcis Termes, 68, a electrician who attended the separatist protests with his wife, said he had no hope of Catalonia's prospects for independence.
Last year we had the happiest moments.
I looked at my parents crying for joy to be able to vote but now we're stuck - he shared.
Despite winning an important victory in the regional election last December, Catalan pro-independence factions fought to keep their momentum this year with many of their most famous leaders either isolated or detained for their role in organizing the referendum declaring independence later on.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who returned to the protest for police on his phone, said the conflict had been extinguished by politicians on both sides.
“The story is getting more stressed,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison before trial since late last year, announced he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Activating as a candidate for the European election is the best way to report falling back in the democratic and repressive values that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested when parking in the house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old were arrested after the car repeatedly hit a home in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 p.m. BST.
Investigator Bob Blemmings said the incident caused damage to the gates and the building itself.
There are shootings about the car at some point.
Menga's shot brings 1-0 victory for Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's Premier Lead Helps Livingston Win
Livingston was surprised by Rangers when the Ibrox home team was led by Steven Gerrard with only two losses in 18 games.
Dolly Menga’s score has proved to be a difference when Gary Holt’s side has raised Hibernian in just a few seconds.
Gerrard's team has yet to have a distinct goal in this season's Premier League and face the hearts leader, who leads eight points ahead of the next Sunday.
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has stretched his undefeated series of matches in six games, as head coach Holt has smelled a failure since replacing the first month of the game.
Livingston missed the chance to play with the under-the-scenes.
Holt's team should have led before they scored, with their direct tactics making Rangers difficult.
Scott Robinson struggles but overcomes the target, then Alan Lithgow can only direct his efforts more strongly after leading the ball to Craig Halkett on the field level.
Homeowners are confident to play Rangers in front of them, knowing that they can make trouble for their guests with personal techniques.
And that's a strategy for the score set.
Rangers gave a penalty kick and the lead Livingston, Declanyou and Robinson coordinated on Menga, who had the ball touch and scored the main spot between the ball.
At this point, Rangers took over the ball but found that the defensives could not be broken and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost no difficulty.
The battle went on to the second half, although Alfredo Morelos received help from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed under the feet of Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow turned to another gameplay by Livingston.
Continuous phases of the ball into Livingston and are constantly summarized, when there are two penalties - following Halkett's challenge for replacement Glenn Middleton, one because of the touch of the ball - were successfully disrupted.
'Black' with Livingston - analysis
From Alasdair Lamont of the BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A good match and match for Livingston.
The team is excellent, continuing to reach out to expectations in the back-flow.
Their style of play and their players have rarely changed since they returned to their top position, but significant status must be given to Holt because of how he honed the team since he appeared.
You have too many strong players.
Captain Halkett is the overarching, arranging an excellent line of defenses, while Menga is constantly retaining the position of Mr. Frank Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers were lacking inspiration.
Just as under Gerrard, they did not meet those standards.
The last missing shot - the only chance to open the host team - and that's a wake-up call for Rangers, the team that landed in the middle of the group.
Erdogan receives a lot of nuance in Cologne
There were good smiles and weather on Saturday when Turkish and German leaders met breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aiming to heal relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne for the opening ceremony of a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters were also nearby to meet with their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also condemned Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Two extreme protests reflect the division of a guest who is hailed as a hero of some Turkishs in Germany and is cursed by others as a authoritarian.
Accidents in DeVford: Bicycle riders killed in a car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The crash took place near Bestwood Road, and the city's three-way crash, a bustling neighborhood in DeVford, south-east of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the medical staff arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The accident occurred several months after another cyclist died in a car crash and ran on Childers Road, about a mile from Saturday’s crash.

Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
Six employees were injured in a riot in a prison for men with strict security, the prison official said.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 p.m. BST Sunday morning and are still ongoing.
Experts -Tornado - was brought to war, ending around 17:30.
The officers were checked at the scene with small wounds.
A spokesman for the Prison Management Board said: “Special training camp staff were deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six injured employees were treated.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the individuals involved will be transferred to the police and may spend time after the shock longer.
Long Lartin prison has held more than 500 prisoners, including the nation’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that Prison Supervisor was treated at the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-violent officers were called to go to prison to deal with a serious rebellion in which employees were attacked with ball balls.
Hurricane Rosa in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with last month's flashbacks
It’s very rare that tropical depression strikes Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week when the energy trails of Hurricane Rosa in the southwest desert remain, entailing flood risks.
The National Meteorological Department released a screening on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to follow a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, but there was rain on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Department in Phoenix has mentioned in a report that only the tropical cyclones have formed tropical storms or tropical depression within 200 miles of being poured into Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a storm within 40 miles of landing on the Arizona border.
The latest forecast models from the latest National Storm Center predict the rainfall is about 2 to 4 inches high, with a 6-inch rise in floods at the Mogollon Belt in Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert include the central Rockies and the Great Indigenous Tank that will be inundated from 1 to 2 inches, with a separate level of flooding that can be up to 4 inches.
With uninfluenced areas suddenly flooded, the rain from Hurricane Rosa could be a good omen because the region is in drought.
Although flooding is a deep concern, some waterfalls can still be happy to receive because the Southeast is suffering from drought.
According to weather.com, only more than 40 percent of Arizona region are suffering from extreme droughts, but remains the second highest in the same category.
First, Hurricane Rosa passes by leaving lands on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still under storm at a wind speed of up to 85 miles per hour, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm hit colder ocean currents in the Pacific Ocean and gradually weakened.
Therefore, forecasts show that there will be landslides in Mexico as tropical depression passes by Monday evening.
Rainfalls in parts of Mexico can be significant, signaling the possibility of flooding is not small.
Weather.com reports that the total amount of rain is estimated from 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to northwest of Sonora, which can be up to 10 inches.
Rosa is heading north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then scan through Arizona and land on southern Utah on Tuesday night.
The main danger predicted from Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora and the southwestern U.S. Desert, the National Storm Center said.
These rains are expected to cause floods and floods that are life-threatening in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: Four intentionally killed suspects were arrested

He was taken to the hospital in condition - fixed -
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man arrested during the night in Radstock, Avon and Somerset, police said.
Officers have called on people if they can keep any video related to the incident, go to the press.
Trump shares that Kavanaugh 'convenients of the Democrats' selfishness, anger
A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party’s cruel and excessive tactics, Trump said in a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Kavanaugh was “consuming the selfish, angry” of the Democratic Party during his election.
Kavanaugh countered parliament on Thursday, strongly denied and strongly an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually attacked her decades before they were teenagers.
Ford also testifyed at the hearing of her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that the American people had witnessed Kavanaugh’s excellence and qualities and courage that day.
A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm that one of the most false legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a resume serving the genuine public, he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president mentioned the details of Brett Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of voting for Republicans in midterm elections.
There are only five weeks left to one of the most important elections in life.
I don't run but run - you share.
That’s why I’m going everywhere to fight for bright candidates.
Trump says Democrats are trying to control and obstruct.
The first-core presidential vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh’s candidate is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of people died from an earthquake, tsunami in Indonesia, and the damage has increased.
At least 384 people have died, many are swept away as giant waves hit the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Suwon, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in a beach festival in the city of Palermo on Friday when waves were up to six metres (18 feet) high on the shore at sunset, scanning to cause many to die and destroy everything along its path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-degree earthquake.
When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still taking part in their activities on the beach and did not leave immediately and they became victims, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman from the National Disaster Protection Agency (BNPB).
The tsunami did not come on its own, it pulled cars, wood, houses, swept through everything on the mainland, said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had passed through open waters at a speed of 800 kilometres (497 miles per hour) before landing on the coast.
Some climb up trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palermo.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops were destroyed, broken bridges and collapsed and a mosque was submerged in the country.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes have been found in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Energy Assessment and Applications Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy launched by Friday’s powerful earthquake was about 200 times as high as the energy of the atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, according to the announcement.
Nugroho described the damage as “big” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damages may not have stopped while along the coast of 300 km (190 mi) north of Palo, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The media - totally paralysed with no news - from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their employees and volunteers are coming to affected areas.
“This has been a tragedy, but the tragedy can become much more terrible,” they said.
The agency was widely condemned on Saturday for failing to announce that the tsunami came to Palermo, although officials said the wave had come over the time of the warning.
In a non-professional video posted on social media, it is possible to hear a man standing above screaming panic for those on the street about the approaching tsunami.
A few minutes later, a wall of water poured into the shore, scanning the buildings and cars.
Reuters can’t confirm the movie.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that broke down regional contact around Palermo, making it difficult for the government to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities say the military has begun to send cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but those who are still in need of food and other basic necessities.
The city airport has been reopened for relief efforts and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the evacuation centres in Palermo on Sunday.
The number of people killed in the Indonesian tsunami increased by more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
While the staff of the World Vision from Donggala have safely arrived in the city of Palermo, where employees are in the tariffs built in the yard, they have gone through devastating scenes on the road, Doseba said.
They told me they saw a lot of homes destroyed,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even as aid groups began making significant moves at the start of disaster relief tools, some complained that foreign aid workers with high expertise had been prevented from moving to Palermo.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to do so if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster area.
That didn't happen.
“This remains a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Red Cross of Indonesia.
Once the government decides, yes, this is a national disaster -- we can be ready with international support but no statement yet --
When the second night falls after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of those who are still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be the magic of transplanting the dark stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled up from the drain.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman trapped under the ruins for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia's national paragliding team coach, coached two of the missing paragliding players for the Asian Games, which was held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including England Mandagi, were his students.
“As a veteran in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled that in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread in the paragliding community, he was desperate to text with WhatsApp to rivals at Palo, who were attending the beach festival.
However, his message indicated that there was a grey instead of two greens.
“I think that means the messages have not been sent,” he said.
The bandits took $26,750 when the ATM was deposited at Newport in Leve.
According to reports from the Newport Police Department, thieves took $26,750 from a Brink bank employee when they were depositing money into an ATM at Newport in Leve.
The driver on the car cleaned the ATM in the entertainment district and was prepared to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy reported in the article.
When he was busy, a man--had come from behind the Brink employee--and took away the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the report, witnesses saw multiple suspects scrambling around the scene, but police did not identify the number of subjects involved in the case.
Anyone with information about the identity of the relevant suspect please contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He wrote in a statement on Twitter on Saturday: “People knew me before that I was Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been named Ye for a while and uses the name \"8th album\" released in June.
The change took place before he appeared on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He was a guest in the show on behalf of singer Ariana Grande when she reported her emotions, the show creator said.
As well as his current synonym, West had previously said the word was religious to him.
\"I believe that \"ye\" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible the word means \"you,\" West shared earlier this year, while talking about his album title with the broadcaster Big Boy.
I'm friends, I'm us, it's us.
The transition goes from Kanye, which means unique, to Ye - the reflection of good, the bad, the reverse, everything.
The album is more than our own reflection.
You are one of the famous rappers to change your name.
Sean Combs is widely known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he said he was aiming for Love and Brother Love.
An artist who has collaborated with West, JAY-Z, is also wondering whether or not there is a tile and a flowering.
Mexico’s president says it will not send troops against civilians
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said he will never use military forces against civilians as the country moves toward the 50th anniversary of its bloody revenge against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he never brought the army to suppress the people of Mexico.
The military opened fire during a peaceful protest in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at the time as left-wing student movements were taking root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support Mexican youth by subsidizing them monthly and opening free public universities.
He said the issue of unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to get involved in the worst.
The United States should double its A.I. aid.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount of money spent on research in the field, AI investor Kai-Fu Lee, who used to work for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government issued an announcement on AI, even though the U.S. overall lacks an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: its goal to become a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget will be a positive start, as all other countries fall behind the United States very far, and we’re looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Double funding could double the chance that the next huge AI achievement would be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book, Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order - published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face ++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked at an AI system that beats Hulklo players in the U.S. at the highest ranking, then as executive director at Microsoft Research and Google's branch director in China.
Lee approaches previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Advanced Project Research Agency’s Manufacturing Agency’s Manufacturing Agency’s Manufacturing Agency, and is concerned when the next competition will take place, in order to help determine the next vision.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government aid, Lee said.
“It’s not that China is calling for all the scholars to lead; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired bright stars from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee shares changes in immigration policy that can also help the United States strengthen its AI efforts.
He added: “I think green cards should be automatically granted to doctors about AI.”
The Chinese parliament issued the next generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee added: China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides aid to those of academic institutions similar to how the Foundation and other governmental organizations subsidize U.S. researchers, but the quality of research in China is lower.
Earlier this year in the United States the Department of Defense established a Center for Artificial Intelligence to intervene with partners from industry and education, and the White House announced the creation of the Artificial Intelligence Selection Committee.
This month’s Agency for Advanced Defense Research Projects announced a $2 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
At the National Science Foundation, they now invest more than $100 million per year for AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law has sought to establish a National Security Council on Artificial Intelligence but has not seen any moves for months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change of national name
The people of Macedonia voted in the referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to the Republic of North Macedonia - or whether it was a decades-long settlement of the dispute with Greece to prevent the accession of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, confirmed that the name of its northern neighbor corresponds to its own territory and vetoed the participation of NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but protesters said the change would undermine the national identity of most Slavics in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised concerns about whether voters would meet at least 50% of the requirements for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum is: “Do you agree to become a member of NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said it was a price to pay to pursue joining institutions such as the EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of which emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79, at Skopje, said: \"Today I come to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can freely enjoy the patronage of the European Union because it is towards safer life for all of us.\"
While members of parliament are not legally bound, they have said they will comply with the voting results to make a decision.
Changing the name will require two-thirds of the vote in parliament.
The National Election Commission said there were no reports of abnormalities until 1 p.m.
However, the voter percentage reached only 16%, compared to 34% in last year’s parliamentary election, when 66% of voters voted.
Elector Gjose Tanevski, 62, in the capital Skopje, said: \"I vote for my children, because our position is in Europe.
Macedonia's prime minister, Zoran Zaev, Mr. Zorica his wife and his son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia over the country's change of name, which would pave the way for NATO and the European Union's membership in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov is preparing a small tent and pulling a seat in front of a tent erected by those who will boycott the referendum.
Kavadarkov said: “We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join the main road, not the back door.”
We are a poor nation, but we are poor.
If they don’t see us as Macedonia, then we can move to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian link.
Zaev said as a NATO member would bring vital investments to Macedonia, where unemployment accounts for more than 20%.
“I believe the majority will agree because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He said that a result - an agreement - would be - a confirmation of our future -
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonia Institute of Policy said about 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - lower than the mandatory vote.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, said 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they made a vote.
A successful referendum must have a vote of 50 percent and one vote.
The failure of the referendum shows the first serious blow to pro-Western policy since last May.
Sergio Aguero in Manchester City has broken all Brighton defenses to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling destroyed Brighton's defenses with Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero was at a level with a score score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass from the middle of the pitch when he began to lead the ball.
He climbed up before three Brighton defenders before he climbed into the empty field.
Aguero found himself surrounded by four blue shirt players.
He climbed up a defender before blocking the other rivals at the edge of Brighton's frame.
The pass to the left, leading the ball right to Sterling.
The English recruit led his first ball touch in the ban for Aguero, who fired his right shoe with a shot to defeat Brighton Mathew Ryan from the right side of the net.
Coach Pep Guardiola told reporters: \"Aguero has some injuries in his leg.\"
“We’re talking about just letting him play for about 55 or 60 minutes.
What happened.
We were so lucky that he scored the point at that time.
But it was Sterling who gave the first advantage to the Blue Shirt players in the fight at the British Premier League.
I scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball down deep into Brighton's field in the match.
He brought a top ball to the left wing to Leroy Sane.

Scherzer wants to burn all of his life against Rockies
With the Nationals being removed from the final round of ticket competition, there is no reason to start again.
But a Supporter Scherzer hopes to win Sunday's game against Colorado Rockies, but this only makes sense when there's a round left for Rockies, the team leading up to a game against Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies won at least one special spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but is still looking to hold the top group.
Although playing is meaningless, at least we are able to get to know the atmosphere in Denver along with the crowd and other teams will play with any of the highest modes I can play this year.
Why don't I want to play in such a game?
The Nationals have not yet announced the player's opening in Sunday's game, but it seems that Scherzer will be playing in this situation.
Scherzer, who plays his 34th start, will have a balling training session on Thursday and play on his Sunday vacation.
Washington's right-hand hand scored 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 attacks in 220 two-thirds of this season's competition.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia
The president mentioned the details of the situation surrounding his Supreme Court, choosing Brett Kavanaugh when talking about the importance of voting for Republicans in midterm elections.
All we do is bring potential in November.
There are only five weeks left to one of the most important elections in life.
This is one of the big, big, non-electional but executive things that led me to go everywhere to fight for bright candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You will see the negative, negative Democratic Party now exist.
And they are determined to suppress rights by using any trick, and then you will see selfishness and tricks.
They don't care who hurt, who to step on to gain power and control, they just want to gain power and control, and we won't give them that --
He added: “The Democrats are trying to control and obstruct.”
You’ve seen it in the last four days, he added, and said the Democrats are - anger and selfishness and tricks and lies -
He pointed out that the Senate Judiciary Committee said Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, which had come under way from below.
Do you remember her answer?
Are you going to reveal the information?
What?
No, no, no, I'm expecting -- it's a non-excellent body language -- but the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer an open party.
Making an opinion is unacceptable.
I’m not surprised that Momentum’s activists, in my local party, voted to censor me.
After all, I was the latest in a series of Labour Party MPs who were informed that I was not welcome - for giving comments.
As a member of Congress with me, Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she was determined to support oppositionism.
In my case, the censorship was aimed at me for failing to agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of a national security, economic policy, in Europe, similar irony issues Jeremy disagrees with earlier leaders.
The announcement to the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that - we want inclusive and effective meetings -
For nearly eight years as a MP for the local Labour Party, Friday night’s leadership meetings took place in such a way.
Sadly, today, it is not the tone in many political meetings and promises -- more subtle, more tender -- that has been forgotten for a long time and really whether it has ever begun --
It is increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is evaluated as a reference to whether the leaders of the party accept it.
This began as soon as Jeremy became a leader, as my previous colleagues thought that my political co-operation with me had begun to expect me to transform my mind and take on positions that I would never approve - whether it was about national security or the EU market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and really whatever I say - to carry the abuse on social media calls for elimination, central political accusations, telling me that I should not join the Labour Party.
And not only do I feel that way.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because of my comments on politics.
I was surprised by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who faced the flow of sexual discrimination or racism every day but never avoided it.
One of the saddest aspects of this political era is that the extent of abuse has become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Labour Party should embrace the culture of tolerance.
The fact that we are no longer that open party and with every move - not self-confidence - or change of rules of choice, the Party has become shrinking.
I’ve had a lot of advice over the past two years about urging me to stay calm, don’t be too much of a word, and then I’ll...
But I’m involved in politics, not for that reason.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years before I was just a boy, I have been motivated by the neglect of thatcher government, which has literally caused my comprehensive school to collapse, I have sought to bring better public services to those who need them - whether they are local commissioners or government ministers.
I have never hidden my political views, even at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be mistakenly looked at my policy positions and disagreements with my current leadership.
For those who have pushed for the move on Friday, all I want to share is that when the country wears itself in Brexit, it hurts our households, businesses and public services, I don’t want to waste my time and energy on loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in fact, a message outside Nottingham that I took on, sent to my voters, whether I was a Labour Party member: I am proud to be served and I promise there will be no threat of elimination or any political means that prevent me from taking action for what I believe is the greatest benefit for my grandmother.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr
Two times later might have distorted the final result, but without doubt, Ayr deserved to win this day’s Tennent Premiership.
Now they are at the top of the board, the only crown of ten teams.
In any case, it’s also their super-class defense, as well as many better opportunities for them, with the title of the host team and coach Peter Murchie having the right to be satisfied.
He said: “So far, we have walked through our games so far and we are still undefeated, so I am satisfied.”
Melrose’s Robyn Christie says: “Receiving Ayr, they capture better opportunities than we do.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute goal score, scored by Frazier Climo, took Ayr ahead, but, a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, opened up the game for Warriors, allowing Melrose to show her skills and Jason Baggot to take the ball to the ball.
Climo rose to lead Ayr with a penalty, before which, in the first half, he scored a score by a solo phase to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose began the second half smoothly and Patrick Anderson made it, and Baggot scored more points, shortening the number to five points.
After a long period of severe injuries to Ruaridh Knott, who has fallen back, and since its re-launch, Ayr has led to the pre-eminent lead due to Radford McDowall's debut, Climo scored more points.
Captain Ayr, Blair Macpherson, then suffered a yellow card, and again, Melrose put the extra player at a score not scored by Bruce Colvine, in front of a tense pressure.
However, the host team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for fighting Climo without the ball, from penalties, MacPherson scored on Ayr's support.
Climo scored more points, as he had done almost since re-employment, after Kyle Rowe received David Armstrong's blow and passed on to the winger Gregor Henry after the fifth scored by the host team.
The film star Still Game is about to enter the restaurant business.
The star of Still Game, Ford Kieran, is about to move to the hotel industry after learning that he is considered the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star played Jack Jarvis in the BBC film, written and played by himself in Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the ninth part of the show will be the final part on the radio, apparently Kiernan planning Craiglang's later life.
According to the official list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the matter, but a source from Scottish Sun said that Kiernan expected to be involved in the restaurant business in Glasgow.

The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are also painted with the slogan: “Behind is our rights.
Getting back to the sea is our mission.
Every corner of Bolivia, the memory of a lost coast to Chile in the bloody 19th century resource conflict remains alive - as well as the desire to sail to the Pacific again.
Those hopes are perhaps the most burning in decades, as Bolivia is waiting for the ruling of the international justice court on 1 October after five years of consideration.
Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat, said: “Bolivia is motivated, united and calm, and of course expect in a positive view of the outcome.”
Many Bolivians will follow ICJ’s ruling on major screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will support Bolivia’s statement that, after decades of intense exchanges, Chile has a duty to negotiate a sovereign sea exit.
Evo Morales, Bolivian main president, who faces a fierce debate for re-election next year, also has many cards in Monday’s ruling.
At the end of August, he was determined: “We are about to return to the Pacific Ocean.”
But some analysts say the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia - and this is less likely to change.
The United Nations with its Dutch headquarters does not have the right to give the territory to Chile and has specified that it will not determine the outcome of potential exchanges.
The ICJ’s ruling came just six months after the final debate was made showing that the situation was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, an expert on Chile’s international law.
And beyond Bolivia’s litigation, the last four years can be reversed.
Zárate said: “The issue of access to the sea has been attacked by the current Bolivian government.”
She added that Morales' aggressive statements have cut off all the remaining Chilean goods.
At some point Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate with each other, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually rapid.
Monday will give Bolivia an extraordinary opportunity to open up a new era with a relationship with Chile, and an opportunity to end 139 years of differences in mutual interest, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most famous presidents in Latin America - is using maritime issues as a political lifeboat.
Bolivia added: “Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific.”
Judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to go through the past.
North Korea says there will never be nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never denuclearize its nuclear weapons unless it had been able to trust Washington before.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the U.S. to fulfill its promises at the Singapore summit between its leaders.
He commented that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be preparing to restart his nuclear foreign policy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a dream as he continued U.S. sanctions and opposition to the declaration to end the Korean War to bring North Korea to ruin.
Washington has been cautiously agreeing with the statement without Pyongyang taking the first recorded weapons disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump look forward to a second summit.
But there is no doubt that Pyongyang is very serious about abandoning a arsenal of weapons that the country can see as the only way to secure safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion Paris launches the latest product line of elegance hats that are about to wave across major streets near you
If you want to get rid of your hat collection or stay away from the sun, you don’t have to look far away.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of other stylish early-team designs in their SS19 collection on the runway that would stylish design at Paris Fashion Week.
High-applicable hats swept Instagram this summer and the designers brought their eye-catching creativity to the stage.
Valentino's standout was a beige overtop of a wide-tailed rim attached to fur-like accessories, coating the model's head.
Other oversized accessories include spherical melons, witch hats, and even a puppies - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of strange masks - just as good as it was for Halloween.
Many squirt masks are stitched in the same way as the Hannibal Waller rather than the high-end fashion.
A complete diving device-like design with breathing and protective glass, while another device looks like a melt-cream ice cream.
And if you continue to catch in a huge fashion direction - then you're lucky.
The stylish predicts that big ear hats may be about to cover all the big streets near you.
Large hats became hot on the heels of ‘La Bomba’, the wide-angle cap used by Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fan brand behind the extremely realistic hat launched across social media has brought another great creative to the stage floor - a bag of niche walking on the beach nearly as large as a bath suit.
The burning orange raffia filament bag, bordered by raffia filament with the upper part with a white leather handle, is a prominent item in Jacquemus’s La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
FREE designer Luke Armitage told FEMA: “I expect to see large seafaring hats and bags flooding over the big streets next summer, as the designer has made a huge impact that it’s hard to ignore the demand for large accessories.”
John Edward: Foreign language skills are essential for global citizens
Private schools in Scotland maintain their academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with a string of rewarding academic results, strengthened by both individual and collective aspects of sports, art, music and community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, sponsored by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), are working to bring the best quality of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to equip them with deep and broad knowledge, as well as to drive the profession and position of their students as global citizens.
As an educational division that can design and run the school’s particular curriculum, we see modern languages continue to be a common and selected topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: “If you talk to someone in his language, what he understands is going to be his reason.
If you talk to him in his own language, what is said will go into his feelings.
This is a convincing message that we don’t just rely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From recent exams this year, we can see that the language that is leading in rankings with points in private school is the best.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages scored higher than A.
Data collected from 74 school members of SCIS shows that 72 percent of students scored more than A in Chinese, along with 72 percent studying German, 69 percent studying French, and 63 percent studying Spanish, also scored A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are going to look at foreign language as an essential skill that children and adolescents will not be able to do in the future.
Chooseive foreign language subjects are being valued as STEM majors in private school programs as well as elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Skills and Occupational Council in 2014 found that in the reasons why employers have difficulty finding people, it is due to a lack of foreign language skills.
As a result, foreign language skills become more practical in order to equip young people to enter professional practice in the future.
With more career prospects in need of language, these skills become practical in an increasingly flat world.
No matter how people choose to work, if they learn a second language, they will gain a real advantage in the future when they have such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly in the native language, a polychemist will clearly lead every challenge.
According to a YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to practice a simple piece of association in another foreign language, and only French is the only language with a percentage of a single unit, 15 percent.
That’s why investing in language teaching is essential for today’s children.
Getting in multi-language hands, especially the languages of developing economies, will equip children with a brighter potential for finding a real job.
In Scotland, every school teaches different languages.
Some schools will focus on more modern foreign languages, while others will teach foreign languages that are considered important to the UK in vision by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever the child enjoys, there are diverse languages to choose from within private schools, along with a team of professional teachers.
Private schools in Scotland focus on providing an academic environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need for success, no matter what the future is hidden.
It cannot be denied that, in an international business environment, foreign language will continue to be an extremely important factor for the future of the country, which should be replicated in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as international communication skills.
Private schools will continue to offer this opportunity for Scottish youth: diverse and outstanding.
There can be no other choice.
John Edward is director of Scotland’s private school.
LeBron made his debut at Lakers during the Sunday Battle in San Diego.
The waiting is about to come to an end for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James play their first game for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the pre-season match against Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
But you'll be in the game for how long you won't be identified.
Walton said on Lakers’ official website: “It will be within 48 minutes.”
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said it was likely that James would play in the game during a limited period of time.
Following weekly training, James was asked about plans for six pre-season matches at Lakers.
He said: \"I don't need to play a few games before the season at this stage of my career anymore.\"
Trump's campaign in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
Tonight, at Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump began his campaign.
This is the first stop in Trump’s five campaigns in the coming week, including a stop in pro-Government states like Tennessee and Mississippi.
The vote for his nominee to be nominated in the blank state of the Supreme Court is being delayed, Trump is trying to defend his support ahead of the next midterm election, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress as the vote begins in November.
Trump’s campaign in West Virginia starts at what time tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to begin at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Mr. Trump’s campaign in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to refer to Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing this week, a Supreme Court judge, who is currently facing allegations of sexual assault and Senate votes to move back a week for the FBI to investigate.
However, the main purpose of these massive campaigns was to draw support for Republicans ahead of the November election.
As a result, according to Reuters, the campaign’s goal through 05 campaigns next week is to support volunteers and Republicans in the race to protect and expand the majority of the votes they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives.
Congressional control is an important issue in the agenda, so the president will visit as many states as possible before entering the busy election season - a Trump campaign spokesman.
It is expected that at the Wormico Arena, the city of Wheeling, tonight's campaign could attract supporters from -Ohio and Pennsylvania, while attracting Pittsburgh media to report - West Virginia Metro News radio said.
Saturday will be Mr. Trump’s second visit to West Virginia last month, which he won by 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to support Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the position of Senator of West Virginia, as he is now ranked in the polls.
Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, said: “The president’s visit to the state to take advantage of the vote for candidates is not a good sign of Morrisey.”
2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team is determined to fight against the Cup in single matches on Sunday
After three unbalanced games, Saturday afternoon’s match can be essential for the Ryder Cup.
Turning your wrists in a pendulum style to create momentum is a whole new sport concept, but also the movement that athletes really believe in, especially in these games.
Where is the current momentum?
They led six points, flying only four, and I think it was a driving force for us, Jordan Spieth, to share while walking for a relaxing walk.
Of course, the European team has an advantage, four points ahead, and they have 12 more matches.
As Spieth said, the U.S. team still had some hope and they were greatly encouraged, especially with Spieth and Justin Thomas.
Spieth was a former golfer in playing the ball from position to hole and he always led the mirror.
The screams were getting bigger and bigger when he came to his round, especially the squeezing of the game as he and Thomas turned the ball into the hole.
The same is true of the 15th game, which means that he has full confidence in the American team’s back-flow.
Spieth said: “You have to think carefully and worry about your own game.”
All the athletes have left.
There are 18 holes left to score.
Over the past two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an undisputed legend of the Ryder Cup, were the only couple to win higher scores than Spieth and Thomas.
The couple of odd but remarkable European teams have won 4:0 and cannot make a mistake.
Moliwood is the only pair not to hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoid bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and nine later golf holes on Friday morning.
That victory and the energy from them spread to a crowd of excited fans gave people the feeling that the two of them were the opponents to defeat on Sunday; and no other player deserves more than Fleetwood or Molinari to defend the European team's victory at the time the sun sets on Le Golf National.
I hope both of you are at the same time at different golf holes.
However, it was too early to confirm the European team's victory.
Suzanne Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourball series in the morning, when playing against Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes caused the Spanish and Swedish players to lose their chance of counterattacks.
On Sunday, fear that no one could pull them out of that defeat.
Fourball and foursome matches are always worth the most because of the interactions between the duo, their advice, and the observation of the game strategy that changes only in clogged.
The European team played better and led quite a long way ahead of the last day, but this foursome series showed that the American team still had a chance to win.
European team led 10-6 before the start of the Ryder Cup final date
The European team will take advantage of the Ryder Cup's final day after the spectacular four-ball and four-foursome games, leading to the U.S. team 10-6.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took this advantage with two Tiger Woods wins to win four points on the Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, determined to win back the cup to lose to your team two years ago, won the U.S. in the morning fourball match, leading 3-1.
The U.S. team played better in the foursome series, winning two games, but couldn’t win the final.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in Sunday's singles series to regain the cup.
Fleetwood was the first European golfer to win four consecutive points when he and Molinari, often referred to as the couple,Molliwood, were the second pair after the dramatic weekend that had won four points in four openings in the Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball match, they had a more convincing victory against Woods and American recruiter Bryson Dechambeau with a score of 5&4.
Woods played two games on Saturday and sometimes had bright moments, but so far, he has lost 19/29 matches in the four-and-foursome series, including seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, after taking a break in the morning fourball series, returned to the foursome match against Düstin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, two players who were ranked 1st and 3th in the world, with a score of 2&1.
However, despite the pleasant weather of southwest Paris, the European team did not have an easy day to play.
The winners have won three times Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas have set a key milestone for the U.S. team with two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory against Spanish players, Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-ball match, and then went on to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with a 4&3 score in the foursome, despite missing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only twice a team led by four points can start single matches, although Furyk's team can only hold the draw.
After only being considered second in two days, Sunday will most likely become a backline for the team.
North Korea declares unilateral disarmament without faith
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that sanctions are still being maintained further deepening their doubt on the U.S., and in this situation, it will not be able to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho, speaking at the U.N. General Assembly annual meeting, said North Korea had taken - several good-will measures - over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantled nuclear testing bases and committed non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we don’t see the same move from the U.S. side,” he said.
If we can’t trust the U.S. side, we won’t be confident in national security, and in such a situation, we won’t be able to unilaterally defend ourselves first.
Although Ri still repeats North Korea’s familiar complaint about Washington’s refusal to denuclearize the nuclear weapons, according to each stage, and North Korea will receive the corresponding benefit of taking steps, his speech this time had a notable point not to reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had previously refused.
Ri spoke of a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June.
North Korea was still seeking to formally end the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States insisted that Pyongyang had to give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also opposes calls to ease harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
The U.S. insists on “releasing nuclear weapons first” and increasing sanctions by sanctions sanctions to achieve its purpose in a coercive way, even protesting the end of the war, Ri said.
The view that sanctions can make us bow to our knees is just the wild dream of those who don’t understand us.
But the problem here is that these ongoing sanctions continue to lose our trust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between President Kim and President Trump as the US leader presented at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the foreign minister referred to three meetings between President Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: \"If the nuclear disarmament party is South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization talks will not fall to a standstill.
However, Ri’s tone was quite different from last year, when he said before the General Assembly that North Korea’s launch of missiles into the U.S. continent was inevitable in a suicide mission after the president, Mr. Trump, called Kim “the missileman.”
Last year at the United Nations, Trump threatened to destroy North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for taking steps to disarmament, but Trump also stressed that there is a lot to do and sanctions must remain the same until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t set a deadline for this: Two years, three years or just five months are no problem.
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for their efforts.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday before the UN Security Council: \"The sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be implemented strongly and untolerant until we can confirm the complete denuclearization result, finally, with proof of verification.\"
The Security Council has agreed to strengthen sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to halt funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo held talks on the sidelines of official meetings of the United Nations General Assembly and said he will visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the final visit was not very good.
He left Pyongyang after his visit in July and said the talks had made certain progress, but only hours later, North Korea accused the foreign minister of making a “black” social-like request.
North Korea is committed to meeting South Korean President Moon Jae-In this month to dismantle a missile test base and a nuclear complex if the United States has a similar move.
He said Chairman Kim directed that the “similar move” he was looking for was the security guarantee that Trump had committed during the Singapore talks and moved toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take full rest course
In an effort to combat the culture of learning pressure machinery, with the ‘night-sighted’ student drinking coffee instead of water, a new course at Harvard University this year has encouraged all college students to sleep more.
Students who study at the world’s number one university don’t often know the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical University, is an expert at the Women's Hospital and Brigham who designed the course, and he himself believes it is the first course of this category in the United States.
Inspiration began this course after he took part in a talk about the impact of lack of sleep on the learning process.
“After the end of the talk, a student came to me and said, ‘Why did you know this until the last year?’
She said that no one told her about the importance of sleep, which really surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course was first introduced this year, explaining to students the importance of good sleep habits to enhance academic and sports outcomes, while improving their overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical University and chief executive of medical services at the university, said the school decided to introduce the course after finding students with severe sleep shortages during the week.
The one-hour course includes a wide range of interactive tasks.
In an image of the dormitory room, in which students can click on a cup of coffee, curtains, exercise machines and books to learn about the effects of caffeine, light and lack of sleep affecting sports performance, as well as the importance of forming on-time sleep habits.
In another part, participants learn how long-term sleep deficits can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, college campus maps, with interactive symbols, encourage participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that this course cannot immediately change the student’s behavior.
But we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the impact on your health when choosing to smoke,\" Czeisler added.
He said the culture is proud of students who are still alive, while modern technologies and increasing pressure on students that lead to lack of sleep are an increasingly serious problem.
Ensure adequate sleep, good sleep quality should become the student's \"secret weapon\" to combat stress, burnout and anxiety - even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep causes the brain to fall into hunger, leading us to constantly hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student who was studying biology, chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, and he also took one of his first class last year at Harvard.
He said the course helped him “open his eyes” and inspired him to make an effort to organize a course across the school.
He hopes that the next step will be to suggest that all postgraduate students join a similar study program before starting competition in the main course.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider setting an alarm for sleep, waking hours, and also be aware of the harm of the ‘green light’ that comes from the electronic screen and LED lights, which can cause your circadian rhythm disorder, which can lead to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga takes down Gerrard's boys
Rangers had an unsuccessful date when Dolly Menga's counter-attack failed Steven Gerrard's team 1-0 against Livingston.
Ibrox's team hopes to mark the first win since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team caused the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 games as head coach, stretching eight points from the team leading the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga maintained a seven-minute attack before the end of the first half, but Rangers' gas seemed never to be crushed.
Rangers have now fallen to sixth place, while Livingston has climbed to third place, and behind only Hibernian on the goal difference.
And Rangers also had to deal with another problem after arbitration Calum Spence had to treat wounds at the head after a clear object was thrown from the head of the guest field.
Gerrard changed the squad eight times that the squad had crossed Ayr to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt held the Livi 11 and won a point against the Hearts team last week and he must have been extremely pleased with how his students surrounded the enemy in each attack.
Although Rangers hold more balls, Livingston is actually dangerous when there is a ball.
They were supposed to have scored just two minutes after Menga first launched Scott Pittman, attacking Allan McGregor's city frame, but the midfielder missed this opportunity.
A deep shot by Keaghan Jacobs took the ball to the foot of Captain Craig Halkett, but defender Alan Lithgow could only take the ball to the back of the wall.
Rangers took control of the ball on the pitch, but their gameplay was primarily based on hope rather than trust, especially in the last one-third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos said he had to be fined on a penalty because he and Steven Lawless had a collision but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian player's appeal.
Rangers had only twice hit the finish line in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had hardly had any trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's counterattack.
Although Livi’s opening in the 34th minute is thought to be an advantage, no one can deny that their victory is absolutely worth it.
Again, Rangers couldn’t handle Jacobs’ deep margin throws.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Brandt struck Scott Robinson, while Scott chose Menga to make a simple finish.
Gerrard immediately had an option during his break, by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and his replacement almost immediately as the player was squeezing the ball for Morelos but Kelly was impressed to immediately stop the ball.
But Livingston succeeded in pulling the team to the right gameplay they wanted, as Lithgow and Halkett repeatedly rolled out long lines.
Holt's team had the opportunity to rise ahead in the last minutes of the game, but unfortunately McGregor chose the right position to stop Jacobs before Lithgow hit wide heads from the corner.
The new player to Rangers' Glenn Middleton went on to complain for a penalty after a collision with Jacobs, but was once again rejected by referee Thomson.
Jurisdiction: The Inventor of Geiger Counter
On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and ONLINE... future physicist Johannes Wilhelm-Hans-Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of radiation detection and measurement, which invented the platform for the device called the Geiger Counter.
Since then, Geiger counters have not only become a scientific pillar, but also a pillar of popular culture. For example, the following is a dialogue in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring scientist and cow king Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What is this?
Rogers: This is the Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When he put these headphones in, the sentence could actually hear the effects of radioactive atoms in minerals.
Evans: Yes, there's a sound this way.
Hans-Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63th birthday.
However, the invention of his name remains with time.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system how to ‘see’ damaged cells
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system how to watch damaged cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system how to recognize broken cells during treatment.
This method includes getting immune cells from patients, changing cells in the laboratory.
These cells can then ‘see’ the common protein in many cancers and be injected into the body.
A test vaccine is giving positive results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with a vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize damaged cells and her ovarian cancer cells disappear after more than 18 months.
This method includes getting immune cells from patients, changing cells in the laboratory, so that these cells can see - the protein that is common in many cancers, called HER2, then the cell is injected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute of the United States, Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we are in the hands of a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 - promotes the development of certain types of cancers - including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and rectum, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of study, taking immune cells from the patient’s body, and ingesting how to target cancer cells, has worked during the treatment of a type of white blood cell.
Kanye received a lot of stones - when he showed his crazy support for the TT. Trump, Make America Great Again after Saturday's Live Music Night (SNL)
It's not going well.
Kanye West received a lot of noise in the studio during the Night of SNL music, following his mantra performance. During the performance, he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song, Ghost Town, still wearing the Make America Great Again, he expressed his opposition to the Democrats and endorsed Trump.
“A lot of times I talk to white friends,” they say, “Why do you like Trump, he’s a racist.”
If I’m worried about racism, I’ve been out of America for a long time,” he said.
SNL began the show with a product featuring Mattyout. In the series, this Hollywood star is ironyed by Brett Kavanaugh's oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the show was not aired, the video recorded West's angry speech was dubbed \"Chris Rock\" on social media.
It’s not clear whether Rock deliberately makes fun of West when posting this post.
West also complained to the audience that he was uncomfortable behind the chicken because of his hat.
They bully me in the back of the scenes.
They said, \"Don't play with that hat.\"
They bullyed me!
Then they said I was in a slump,” he said, according to the Washington Review.
West went on: \"Do you know what we're going to do, he's going to say - to put my hero's symbolic hat on it, because no one can force me to do anything. If you want the world to go forward?
Love -
According to Variety, his speech made the audience cry at least twice, while members of the SNL were confused, one said: “The entire studio was silent.”
West was chosen to replace singer Ariana Grande, as her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West made many people confused with the performance of I Love It, dressed like a Perrier Chai.
West received the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner. He tweeted: “Give one of the bravest souls: YOU WILL HAVE THE HOSPITAL OF THE HOSPITALS.”
But the host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply acting according to his nature, and this was really great.
But I choose not to reward someone (by buying music products or costumes, or by supporting his art) because I believe that person is pursuing and propagating ideologies that are not good for my community.
He has freedom.
We too - you add more.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, officially - named Kanye West -
He wasn’t the first artist to change his name, but only followed Diddy’s path, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, formerly known as Snoop Lion; or Prince's musical legend, changed his name to a symbol and later changed his name to Prince.
Detained of murder in the shooting at Belfast Restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with murder after a person was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident happened in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to go to court at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The allegations will be investigated by the Prosecutor's Office.
The movie star Kingdom's anger is critical of toxic maleity.
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in a violent medieval fantasy television series, Game of Thrones.
But 31-year-old actors are quite angry with the hero's role model and mention that such men on the screen will make young men feel strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that “there’s something wrong here” and asked the question of how to solve the toxic male problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit was married to his girlfriend in the Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, 31, who admitted that he felt 'necessary' to solve this problem.
“At this point, I personally don’t know what we did wrong with so-called maleity,” he said.
“What have we taught men as adults about the problems that exist in front of us?”
Kit believes television may also be partly responsible for increasing toxicity due to the extremely masculinity they build.
He went on to say, \"What is born and what characteristics are due to education?
What is taught on TV and on the street makes boys feel like they have to be a male model?
I think this is really a problem of this era - how do we change it?
“Because there is obviously something that makes sense to our young guys.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any prehistoric or foreign storytelling about the Game of Rights, after the series ended next summer, while claiming that he was “excessive of the battlefield and the war.”
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard’s True West remake film telling the story of a producer and brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife, Rose, was the best thing when he decided to stop the Game of Rights.
“I met my wife in this series, which is where I started for my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose plays Ygritte, the lover of Jon Snow who Kit plays in this Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.

HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new infections
China has announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and Aids has increased by 14 percent.
Health officials say the country has more than 820,000 people with the disease.
In the second quarter of 2018, the number of new cases was recorded as 40,000.
The vast majority of new cases are caused by sexually transmitted infections. This is a major change compared to before.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to blood transmission.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this path has dropped to almost zero. This is a statement by Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and Aids in China annually increased by 100,000.
Sexual HIV infection is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Although homosexuality has been no longer considered illegal in China since 1997, in fact, discrimination against the LGBT community is still very common.
Due to its conservative traditional values, the study estimated that 70-90% of men eventually got married, despite having had sexual relations with men.
Many people have been infected with centuries of disease due to their lack of adequate protection when having same-sex sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed to providing HIV medications to all infected patients to cope with the disease.
Maxine Waters denies her staffing to reveal the data of Republican senators, stressing \"dangerous lies\" and \"inspiration theories\"
On Saturday, U.S. Democratic Representative Maxine Waters rejected the allegations that a member of her staff posted personal information from three Republican senators on Wikipedia about lawmakers.
The Democrats in Los Angeles insisted that these complaints were made by experts and websites.
“The lie, lies, and lies are even more contemptful,” Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
According to the report, leaks include private home addresses and phone numbers from U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, from Utah.
The information began appearing online on Thursday, due to an unknown person at the Capitol Hill House during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against the candidate for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court.
This information was revealed shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to The Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that IP addresses identify the origins of posts related to Waters’ office and disclose information about one of Waters’ employees.
Waters continued to say: “This unfounded obligation is completely false and absolutely a lie.”
“The staff in my office were breached by identity, personal information, and also the safety of these false and false accusations could not have revealed them.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and is absolutely a lie.
Waters’ statement immediately attracted online criticism, including former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial manifests anger,” Fleischer wrote.
This shows that she has no gas to become a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of an act that is not done by them, one should not be angry.
They are not challenged.
They are not asked about the motives of the person who made the allegations.
They must be calm and calm.
Fleischer appears to be comparing Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh's reaction to Democratic criticism and critics also accuse him of being too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was running for Waters in midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
“Big if true,” he wrote on Twitter.
Waters said her office had warned the authorities and law enforcement of these false charges.
We will ensure that the perpetrators will be brought to light - she continues to say - and they will be held accountable for all possible harm and danger to any of my employees.
Johnny English Re-Exploration - Rowan Attackon's Funny Unusual Agent
Now, it's possible to notice a rather traditional trend in any new film that has the British element is looking for the meaning of Brexit. And the next episode of Johnny English's comedy-action series is no exception. The series began premiere in 2003, with Johnny English and the second part called Johnny English - Re-produced, premiere in 2011.
Does self-sacrificing about how useless we are become a new export opportunity for this country?
In any case, Johnny English’s limited capacity with round eyes and flexible facial muscles is allowed to spread things up again - his name is simply representing a comic book designed for non-English-speaking areas.
Of course, he's a secret agent, though he's always oddly ducking in the style of Detective Clouseau, mixing Mr Bean's humor and a little contributing to the Chariots of Fire theme tone during the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
The character's prototype also relies on the traveller and the international mysterious man Atkinson has played in a Barclaycard television commercial that has now fallen into oblivion and caused chaos as he wakes up.
There are some interesting scenes in the latest Johnny English episode.
I like the scene of Johnny English approaching the helicopter while wearing medieval armor and the rotors beating on his hat.
Although Atkinson's humor is fully expressed, the humorous element here seems to be not enough weight and a little excess, especially when the brands -- such as the 007 series and the impossible mission -- have made the comedy just a spice.
The humorous element in this film can only laugh at children, I myself think Johnny English’s silly mistakes are nothing like the joke of Mr. Bean.
The situation that leads the story is that Britain is in serious trouble.
The hackers have penetrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identity of all the British agents operating outside, leading to the loss of the spirit of an agent doing the mission, a very sad little role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the prime minister’s last chance choice, a proud and powerful figure, who is currently facing this political crisis: Emma Thompson has performed very well the version character of Prime Minister Teresa May, but according to the script she doesn’t have much land.
Intelligence advisers reported that the identity of all active agents was exposed and she would have to mobilize a retired spy.
And that person is Johnny English, who is currently teaching in a country, but in fact is teaching lessons outside the program to become a secret agent: there are some fun jokes here, because English teaches students to be agents in the Rock Academy style.
English was called back to the Emergency Meeting Court and reunited with former poor aid Bough, played by actor Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, asking too much of a charming female submarine commander, Vicki Pepperdine takes on this little bit of talent.
So Batman and Robin made trouble with the Queen's Order to return to duty and meet with Olga Kurylenko as beautiful spy Ophelia Bulletova.
The prime minister, meanwhile, is in danger under the curses of tech billionaires after claiming he can solve any problem of British computer headaches: Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their adventures with extra-imaginative clowns: after they styling into waiters, they burned a French restaurant at a glance; caused chaos on Volta's luxury yacht; and English was even more cluttered by trying to use virtual reality headphones to explore Volta's home.
At the end of the film, the knots will certainly be removed, but such a vibrantness is quite similar to the TV channels for children.
It's a pretty unusual work.
And like other Johnny English films, I can't stop asking the question: can't the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a fair role, worthy of your talent?
Labour Party rejects information that is building plans to allow British people to work for four days but receives a five-day salary
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider a progressive plan that will allow the British to work four days a week but receive five days a week.
According to the information received, the party wants business owners to move their savings through the AI revolution to workers by giving them a day off.
That means employees are on a three-day break but still receive the same salary as before.
The sources said the idea was “in line” with the party’s economic agenda and expected to increase support for its workers.
The British General Assembly has confirmed that moving to work four days a week is a way for workers to enjoy the benefits of the changing economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: ‘The process of reviewing policies is expected to be announced later this year.
“This goal cannot be accomplished in a short time, but working four days a week is a desire to fit the party’s agenda in rebalancing the economy in favor of workers as well as the party’s general industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to approve this idea. The Green Party is committed to working four days a week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, this idea has not been adopted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘The four-day work policy is not the party’s policy and the party does not currently consider this policy.’
Dark Prime Minister John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to strengthen the vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the 'individual directors' and 'dividors' at utility services companies.
These plans by the dark prime minister also mean current shareholders in water supply firms may not get their entire share as the Labour Party’s government can apply ‘democracy’ based on behavior considered wrong.
He also confirmed plans for workers to join the company’s board of directors and set up a comprehensive ownership fund to give 10% of the equity of private companies to the company’s employees, from which they are likely to receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, on the show 60 Minutes, about whether the FBI’s findings on Kavanaugh made them change their decision.
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed his final vote to appoint him as Supreme Court judge for at least a week and questioned whether the Federal Intelligence Bureau's findings could cause any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, program reporter-60 Minutes- Scott Pelley asked Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could find evidence that could change the decision.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I think of it, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I spoke at the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, i.e. after the allegations were made and asked, “Do you do it?”
He responded very firmly, firmly and firmly.
Graham's vote seems to be completely certain.
He said: \"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and only one charge that would make me change.\"
“Professor Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it very strongly,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And all the people she calls are unable to verify the story.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the Global Citizenship Festival and what does it contribute to the eradication of poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens’ Festival, an annual music event with the participation of an impressive star cast to carry out an equally impressive mission: ending world poverty.
In the seventh year of the event, the Global Citizenship Festival will witness tens of thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn Beach of Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizenship Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Deforestation Project, an international advocacy group in hopes of ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
To receive free entrance tickets for this event (unless you’re willing to pay for a VIP ticket), music night attendees must complete a range of tasks or actions - such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, calling a phone or any other meaningful form to help raise awareness of the goal of poverty reduction.
But how did this Global Citizens’ Festival achieve success, when there are only 12 years left to reach its goal?
The idea of winning tickets to see a free music night for everyone is a practical way to convince people to call for action, or just another form of keyboard movement -- people feel they're making a real difference by signing a petition online or sending a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, the Global Citizenship Organization has said there are more than 10 million actions - from its noted supporters, promoting a range of different goals.
They say these actions have helped drive leaders around the world to make commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion made to implement interventions that improve the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements from the group’s actions, with at least $10 billion being disbursed or fundraising.
The group estimates that funds are guaranteed to have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some major commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partner organization that includes investors and those who make commitments to help children reach their full potential - promising to provide $25 million to Rwanda to help end the country’s malformation after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the global group of citizens.
With support from the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn social injustice into a historical mark - Ambassador of Nutritional Strength, Tracey Ullman told the audience in a live performance show in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project called Nutrition Power, which ensures nutritional intervention for 5 million women and children.
Answer to one of the frequently asked questions on the team's website - what makes you believe we can end extreme poverty -
The global group of citizens responded: “This will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fail.
But just as the civil rights and anti-racial movements before, we will succeed because together, we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform this year in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy to embody Russia's energy exports - Interior Minister
U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said Washington could mobilise Navy forces - if necessary - to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including the Middle East market.
Zinke alleges that Russia's involvement in Syria -- more notably at the invitation of the legitimate government -- is just an excuse to explore the new energy market.
According to the report, he said: “I believe that the reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to trade energy like in Eastern Europe, the southern valley of Europe.”
And according to official news, there are many ways and measures to prevent this.
He said: \"The United States is capable of using Navy forces to ensure that welding routes remain open and will be closed, when necessary, to ensure their energy resources are not included in the market.\"
Zinke has called on participants of the event to be held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a self-proclaimed nonprofit group - the voice of energy consumers - in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s doings with Russia and Iran, noting that the two are equally effective.
The economic plan that Iran and Russia can choose is to take advantage of and change the type of fuel, he said, while calling Russia “the one who has only one strength,” with the economy relying solely on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration seeks to increase the exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia’s position, which is much cheaper for European consumers.
To this end, Trump’s administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of Nord Stream 2’s Nord Stream 2 oil oil project that, according to Trump, has made Moscow completely controlled Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 Nord Stream 2 project, which is built to double its existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project simply stems from economic reasons and is an example of unhealthy competition.
I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and consumers must be selected from the supplier, Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S.'s stance has sparked a backlash from Germany, which later reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has urged the United States not to interfere with the energy policy of the European Union, as well as bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I face a major problem when there is a third country trying to interfere with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industry Federation (BDI), said after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a look - the 2020 presidential election, Massachusetts Senator said
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would be seriously considering - running for president after midterm elections.
During a meeting at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider running.
The Hill quoted her as saying: “It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix the government’s flaws, and so needs a woman in the top place.”
After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.
Warren criticised President Donald Trump at a meeting in the town hall and said he was placing the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m really worried about what Donald Trump will do to our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticised Trump and his nominated Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said, \"Of course, the FBI must investigate before voting.\"
But a Thursday poll shows that a majority of Warren's voters don't think she should run in 2020.
According to polls conducted by the University ofuffolk/Boston Globe Center for Political Research, 58% of voters -- possibly, in Massachusetts, say the senator should not run.
32% support her to run.
The poll found that more voters supported former Governor Deval Patrick's election, with 38% of voters supporting and 48% opposed voters.
Other potential Democratic candidates named for the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported that Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin provides evidence of Track Palin's Post-Tension Disorder Syndrome (PTSD) at Donald Trump's campaign
Track Palin, 26, served a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he goes through when he comes back, I can completely relate to other families also suffering from the consequences of PTSD syndrome and the injuries that our soldiers carry when they return,” she told the crowd at the campaign for Donald Trump in Oklahoma.
Palin called his son's arrest a clear matter but no one wanted to mention -- and suggested that her son and other veterans returned from the war -- there was a change, more sharp, and wondered if there was respect for them and their teammates, airmen and all the other members of the army for what they had dedicated to the country.
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing others from reporting family violence and possessing weapons while drunk.
18 states and D.C. support the challenge of new refugee policy
eighteen states and District of Columbia are supporting the challenge of a new U.S. policy that rejects asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and D.C. sent a brief collective text on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers who opposed the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace and Sessions lawsuits filed in August in protest of federal policy is not yet revealed.
She said her lover - and the son of the members of his violent gang - abused her but U.S. officials refused to ask for her asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Prosecutors for Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of U.S. asylum applicants are faced with gangs and domestic violence issues.
The new U.S. refugee policy goes against the 2014 decision by the Immigration Advocacy Council that allows migrants with no papers to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy, which ignores the state, federal and international legal system, has had decades.
Federal law requires considering all asylum applications based on the specific facts and circumstances of the applicant and this obstruction policy violates that principle - the brief collective text presented.
Prosecutors also argued in the short text that the policy of refusing immigration harms the U.S. economy, because migrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and-providing the necessary workforce.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked judges to accept immigration applications that did not continue to allow asylum to victims to flee the gang’s domestic violence and abuse in June.
Only allow refugees to leave their country because of repression or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political view, Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
Refugees are never a measure of minimizing all problems - even all serious problems - that people face daily throughout the world.
Demanding rescue efforts in Palo as the death toll doubles in the race for survivors
For those who survive, the situation is increasingly catastrophic.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, shared while patting her son with a fever at an evacuation center in the desperate city of Palo.
Every minute, an ambulance brings another human body.
Clean water is very scarce.
The people returned to their destroyed home, picked up in the water, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were completely overcrowded, after the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
Some people were injured, including Dwi Haris having broken their backs and shoulders lying outside the Pala Military Hospital. Here patients were treated outdoors due to strong aftershocks continued.
His tears erupted as he recalled the intense earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that he was with his wife and daughter.
We don’t even have enough time to save ourselves.
I think I’ve been thrown into the wall’s ruins,” Haris told the Associated Press news agency, adding that his family went to town to attend the wedding.
I heard my wife cry and cry for help, but then I heard nothing.
I don't know what happened to my wife and children.
I hope they are all safe.
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'buying' with 'provocative advertising'
A week after a Chinese official newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper referring to the common interests of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. press to propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned an additional Chinese Daily money to Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of seeking to intervene in the November 6 congressional election.
Trump's allegation of Beijing's attempt to intervene in the U.S. election marks a new phase in a push-up campaign against Washington's China, according to what U.S. officials told Reuters.
Despite the fact that foreign governments place ads promoting trade is completely normal, Beijing and Washington are now stuck in the escalating trade, with evidence that they have imposed high tariffs on imports of both sides.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China’s tariffs on retaliatory in the early stages of war have been designed to target exporters in pro-Pacific states like Iowa.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major agricultural goods exporting state to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote an opinion in Des Moines Register on Sunday, saying China is continuing that bullying behavior by running propaganda ads in our own free newspaper.
In an effort to promote propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of free speech and press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register, Branstad.
On the contrary, at the news outlets on Beijing’s streets, you rarely find dissent and will not see any genuine reflections of China’s various opinions on Chinese economic trajectory, because it is clear that the media is completely under the control of the Communist Party of China, he wrote.
He added that -- one of China's most popular newspapers has avoided his offer of posting -- even though he did not specify which newspaper.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating women from midterm elections with Kavanaugh's case
As many Republicans stand out for the candidate’s position as Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh in front of several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that they may be subjected to a backlash, especially from women, in the midterm elections.
The emotions around the case were quite strong, and most Republicans on the campaign list showed they wanted to continue to vote.
There are things we can't do again -- Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article posted on Saturday.
Reeher said he didn’t think Senator Jeff Flake (Bang R-Arizona) pressed the button to give the FBI an investigation enough to calm down angry voters.
The Washington newspaper, D.C. quoted Shaune Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the MoveOn progressive group on Friday: \"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - tomorrow they won't forget and in November they won't forget.\"
Mic reported: On Friday morning, protesters chanted - November is coming - while paraded in the Senate corridor because the Republican Party was in control of the Judiciary Committee has opted to continue voting for Kavanaugh despite Prof Christine Blasey Ford's testimony.
“Sexual and democratic dynamics will be pushed higher than ever,” Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
It is said that this motivation is now high; yes.
But it may be even higher, especially among women's voters in the suburbs and young voters, between 18 and 29 years old, who don't vote because they don't like the president.
Even before Ford publicly sworn on details of allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court judge, analysts said the public could have a backlash if Republicans continued the confirmation.
NBC News quoted Michael Steele as saying last week: “This could be a mess Republicans have to deal with.”
The issue is not just the vote of the committee or the official vote, or whether Kavanaugh becomes a Supreme Court judge, but more important than how Republicans handle the hospital this time and how they treat the accused, Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA, the Democratic Party support team, told the news channel.
However, Americans have a dissenting view of whether to trust Ford or Kavanaugh’s testimony, it seems that more people suspect Mr. Kavanaugh’s side.
A new poll organized by YouGov found that 41% of respondents were sure or could believe Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they were sure or able to believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% of respondents thought that Kavanaugh could or certainly have lied when giving testimony, while only 30% thought Ford was sure or might have lied.
After Flake pressed the consensus button, the FBI was investigating Ford’s allegations and at least one other accused, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford was sworn before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez accused the candidate of the Supreme Court judge of revealing his genitals in front of her as they attended a party during their studies at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web investors plan to start building new Internet to receive Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup project that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend is called Inrupt, a construction company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store data and which permissions are granted to access which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt project was to dominate the world.
We have to start right away - he talks about this start-up project.
Now is the moment of history.
The app uses Solid technology, which allows users to create their own online personal data - or POD.
This data warehouse may include contact lists, job lists, calendars, music libraries, personal and other professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all are available on a browser and display simultaneously.
The unique thing about this online personal data repository is that users have full control over which kind of information they can access.
The company calls it “the control of data for individuals”.
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea of the Inrupt project is to ensure the company is equipped with the right resources, processes and skills to help provide Solid to everyone.
The company now has Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that has been acquired by IBM, some developers have signed a project-based contract and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications with tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don’t talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not all of their business models can be upgraded overnight.
We don’t need to ask for permission.
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote, “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet when it founded the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential name in the debate over the neutrality of the internet.
Despite the launch of the Inrupt project, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Association, the Foundation Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web - Berners-Lee supplements.
Memorial of Pope Bernard Vann receiving the Order of the Victorian Cross during World War 1
The 100th anniversary of the only Church of England was awarded the Order of the Cross of Queen Victoria during World War I as a warrior who was held in his home country.
Lt. Col. Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he died of being shot four days later, and he had never known he had won the highest honorary medal of the British army.
On Saturday, his two grandsons revealed a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of these grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was a brilliant symbol - when the stone was shown just 100 years after his grandfather's battle to win the medal.
According to the London Times, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann commanded his Battalion across Canal de Saint-Quentin - through dense fog, under strong fire from rifles and machine guns -
He then plunged straight into the bullet and with great emotion - he led the Battalion over, before hitting a rifleman and cutting down three separatists.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just one month after the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “the act I never did, but there was humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also set a wreath after the Royal Brentwood Youth Band parade.
Michael Vann said he felt - extremely honored to take part in the parade - and the courage of a true hero would be noted by the support of so many people -
The martial arts fans wake up all night to watch the Bellator 206, but eventually they only get Peppa Pig.
Imagine you were awake all night to see the Bellator 206 with a hard stands, but were eventually refused to see the main event.
The show's introduction from San Jose said there were 13 battles, including six on the main card and was shown live all night in the UK on Canal 5.
At 6 a.m., as soon as Gegard Mousasi and Roryyou are ready to fight, viewers in the UK are shocked when the screen turns into Peppa Pig.
Some people feel that they are not respected after they wake up close to the morning to watch the game.
One fan tweeted that turning the show into children's cartoons was like -- an unchanging joke --
The government regulated that martial arts content was inappropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to convert into children's programs - Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communication, said when asked about the transfer of the program.
Peppa the Pig
Bellator CEO Scott Coper said they were looking at the broadcast schedule to ensure British audiences can watch the show in the future.
Mr. Coper said, \"I think if we play back, we can solve the problem.\"
But there's 6am Sunday and we can't handle the problem until Sunday according to our time zone, but Monday according to their time zone.
But we are trying to find a solution.
Trust me, when people change the program, there's a lot of messages back and forth and those messages aren't very friendly.
We tried to fix it, we initially thought to be due to technical problems.
But it’s not the end, it’s the government’s rule.
I can promise you that this won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of matches to five, instead of six games as originally expected - the year is the number of matches we usually offer and we have tried to give out to fans.
This is really an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'bad' in terms of sexual orientation
Olympic player Tom Daley said that as he grew older, he always lost people because of his sexual orientation - but that was his motivation for success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize -- I wasn't like anyone -- until I learned in school.
Talking on the Desert Island Discs program led by Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out about the rights of gay men to bring about hope to others.
He also said being a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The host of this long-time rice show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off to heal.
Among the first led by Laverne, Daley appeared as a abandoned person, saying he felt poor - everyone, because his personality was not socially accepted as his sons and daughters clearly -
He said: “To this day, the feeling of self-sacrificing loss and difference still exists, becoming a motivation and strength for me to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he had something -- so that people wouldn't be disappointed knowing the truth about his sexual orientation.
The athlete twice won this Olympic bronze medal has become an active athlete for the LGBT community and he uses his image at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call for more countries to resist discrimination against homosexuals.
He said he spoke out because he felt very lucky to be able to live openly without being distinguished and wanted to bring - hope - to others.
The three-time world champions shared that he loved a man - American film producer Dustin Lance Black. The two met in 2013 and - suddenly loved each other -
Daley married the Oscar winner more than he was 20 last year, but he said the age difference was never an obstacle between the two.
When you had to experience so much suffering as a child - he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - it would be difficult to look for someone who was the same age as he experienced depression in his life.
The couple became the parents of Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his worldview had changed.
If you asked last year, my goal was ‘I have to win gold’, he said.
But you know, there are more things that are more important than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Mr.you.
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was dying and one of the last things he asked was that they had a ticket to the 2012 London Olympics - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell you, ‘I can’t sit in the front row anymore,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he breathed his last breath and even until he stopped breathing and left forever, I couldn’t finally admit that he had to be unbeatable.”
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
\"I just knew that it was my whole life's dream - dancing in front of a crowd of supporters at the Olympic Games, really there was no feeling better than that,\" he said.
It was also an inspiration for him to choose his first song - Heather Small's Proud - his song with him during his training towards the Olympics and still touched him every time he heard it.

Mickelson lacks status on Ryder Cup Premiers on Saturday
The American player Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to raise his style to avoid this record as a sad experience.
Mickelson played in this two-year event 12 times, but Captain Jim Furyk left him on the bench in the fourball and foursome games on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action like when in the United States, the five-time winner must spend all day playing the game in hopes of getting out of the feeling of discomfort.
The 48-year-old with the school was never the ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, even if he was at his height, because the mishaps here would have a severe consequences.
And if this golf course is not enough to obsesse, Mickelson will also have to play on the 9th Sunday against his opponent, the U.K. Championships Cup Hall, which expands Francesco Molinari. This week, Molinari has paired up with Rear Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches.
If the U.S. team is losing four points before starting a 12-game series that wants to start impressively, Mickelson’s match is crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his golfer and didn’t talk too much.
“He understands his role today, he shakes my back, arms through me and says he will be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
- He's very confident.
He is a legend and has contributed a lot to the team, in the past and in the whole week.
I may never have imagined that he played two games.
I imagine more, but that’s how things go and we think it’s the right way.
He wants to play, like all his other teammates.
This Sunday, Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record, becoming the most played player in the Ryder Cup.
It could also be the end of his career at the Ryder Cup because his personal record has never appeared in this tournament.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and draws, although Furyk suggested that his presence provided invisible value to the team.
\"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he likes to laugh at people. There's him in the group really happy -- he explains.
“I think young golfers are happy to meet him and this week is quite fun.
What he does is more than play.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the lead advantage may quickly disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, had experience that even though his team was leading a lot when they entered single games at the end of the Ryder Cup, the results could be easily reversed in a way that was not pleasant at all.
The Dane began playing in 1997 in Valderrama, in which their team, led by Seve Ballesteros, led five points ahead of the American team but eventually won only 14 1/2-1/2.
You always have to remind yourself that we’ve been leading a lot in Valderrama; we’ve been leading a lot in Brookline and we’ve lost, in Valderrama, we won, but we’ve been struggling,” says Bjorn, whose face is envisioning after watching the 2018 Class of 2018 match with a 5-3 win on Friday and leading 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone in the team that it's not the end.
You still have to focus your spirit on tomorrow.
Go out and play well.
The tournament is not finished when the score is not on the table.
We have the goal of winning this year’s cup and that’s our focus.
I’ve always said I’m focused on my 12 golfers, but we also understand the strength of your team - they’re the best golfers in the world -
Joy on the performance of his golfers on the golf course, Bjorn added: “I’ll never say anything before.
Tomorrow will be another war.
Tomorrow is an individual’s performance and will certainly be very different.
It would be great to play in pairs and everything goes well. But when you play in a personal game, all the abilities of a player will be revealed.
That’s the message you have to share with every player, that they have to be ready to play best tomorrow.
Now a pair must be separated and each one must be ready to play the best.
In contrast to Bjorn, the rival’s captain, Jim Furyk, expects his players to show better personal abilities than in pairs, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself went through both directions in the big turns on the last day, having been a winning team member at Brookline before his defeat while the European team was hailed as the “Silver in Medinah”.
“I remember each word,” he said when asked about Ben Crenshaw, the team’s captain in 1999, who gathered and encouraged the players before the last day.
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you’ll want to quickly start as you see in Brookline, or as you see in Medinah.
When the result is following a trend, the matches in the middle will be under a lot of pressure.
We built the squad that way and sent the golfer to the field in a strategic way and tried to make a miracle tomorrow.
Thomas was tasked with leading the team and facing Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, other European players in the first series.
“I chose this group, in that order because I believe it’s a way to get over it,” says Bjorn about the choice for his single match.
German warships continue to be put into service
Local media reported that the latest German Navy destroyer should have run a test in 2014 to replace the former Cold War warship, but at least the next year it was possible to run tests due to the system of error and increased costs.
Die Zeit quoted the military spokesman as saying that Rheinland-Pfalz, the leader of the new destroyer Baden-Wuerttemberg, was now delayed until the first half of 2019.
The ship should have been delivered to the Navy in 2014, but the problems after delivery had hampered the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 would replace the former Bremen-type destroyer.
This means that the ships will be equipped with a powerful gun, a series of air and anti-ship missiles, some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar traces, infrared and sound.
Other important features include longer maintenance times, which could deploy the latest destroyers up to two years away from the national ports.
However, the constant delays meant that these modern warships, which were supposed to help Germany control outside countries, would become obsolete at the time of its use, the Die Zeit newspaper noted.
The Unlucky F125 destroyer became a flagship last year when the German Navy officially refused to run the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
There is little information about the reason behind the return of the ship, but German media refers to - software and hardware vulnerabilities - seriously, which lead to warships that are completely useless if they engage in combat missions.
Software flaws are particularly severe because Baden-Wuerttemberg will be operated by a fleet of 120 sailors - half of whom are on board the former Bremen-type destroyer.
At the same time, it can be seen that the weight of the ship increases significantly, leading to reduced performance and limiting future Navy upgrades.
Rheinland-Pfalz, weighing 7,000 tons, is believed to weigh twice the same warships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also a serious problem.
The project is believed to have teamed substantially up to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - while the initial estimated cost is €2.2 billion.
The latest destroyer mobilization has become particularly important, amid recent warnings about Germany’s naval strength becoming increasingly shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament’s Defence Committee, acknowledged that the Navy was truly capable of participating in warships.
The official said the problem was getting worse over time, because the old ship had stopped working but had no replacement ships.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships were eligible to join the Navy.
The National Trust has a secret life of bats.
A new study is being conducted at a site in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use natural landscapes to hunt for food.
Hopefully these findings will shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The study was conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, tracking the journey of popular bats, mosquitoes (soprano pipistrelles), brown ear bats and Daubenton bats in the Inverewe Garden Area in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be located in important locations around the research area to track the activity of these bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using portable detectors.
Audio analysts will conduct an analysis of all the recordings and determine the sound frequency of bats and the purpose of playing the sound of each specific bat's genus.
Then, maps and reports of bat habitats will be created for detailed drawings according to the natural landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS’ natural conservation adviser, hopes to help determine which areas of life play the most important role for bats and each species living in that environment.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management activities, such as planting grasslands and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and across the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect bats' beans and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and light systems, fly trap paper, some chemical treatment methods for building materials, as well as cat attacks can also pose a risk to bats.
Cyborg is not completely blind.
However, due to night hunting habits, the ears are more useful than the eyes when snoring and hunting.
They use an extremely sophisticated resonance positioning technique to identify obstacles on the way.
The NTS is responsible for taking care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, and especially values bats.
The organization has ten trained professionals who regularly conduct surveys, tests and sometimes participate in animal rescue.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve in Threave lands in Dumfries and Alvarez. It is home to eight of the ten bat species of Scotland.
Managing the land, David Thompson said the land was their ideal territory.
“Threave is a great environment for bats,” he said.
We have many old buildings, a lot of receptors and good habitats.
But there is still a lot of mystery about bats, so work here and in other facilities will help us better understand what bats need to grow further.
He stressed the importance of having to check the life of bats before preserving in the lands, because accidentally destroying their breeding beans could kill up to 400 children and vomiters, almost completely destroying the population.
Cholesterol is a protected species and the killing, harassment, harassment or destroying of their beans is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish Conservation Fund employee, has encouraged the community to help.
“We still need to learn more about bats and with many species, we can’t know how far apart their populations are.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape and his lawyer prepares for German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said sex allegations against him were “fake news” and there were people who were “advertising” by his name.
His lawyer was preparing to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel for posting the allegations.
The Portuguese striker who is currently playing for Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday: The player allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
In Instagram video streaming before 142 million followers hours after the allegations were announced, 33-year-old Ronaldo said the report was fake news.
No, no, no.
What they say today is all fake news - the player five times the Golden Ball said in front of the camera.
They want to take advantage of my name.
It's just normal.
They say my name is famous, but that’s just part of my job.
I'm a happy person and everything's fine -- men add and smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel’s Daily for the allegations, calling it “the unacceptable suspicion of private life.”
Christian Schertz says the player will claim compensation due to moral damages with the amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which could be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at a high-end hotel at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the club, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have returned to the player's room. According to records at Clark County Court, Nevada, he is accused of raping her at the hotel.
Mayorga said Ronaldo was on his knees after the alleged incident and said that he's -99% - a good person - only 1% - not good.
It has been reported that Ronaldo confirmed that the two sides had sexual relations, but based on consensus.
Mayorga also said she had arrived at the police station and was captured with injuries at the hospital, but she later agreed to settle outside court because she had been repealed and worried about her public humiliation.
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to reverse the decision of reconciliation because she continues to suffer from the alleged incident.
At the time of the indictment, Ronaldo was preparing from Manchester United to transfer to Real Madrid, but eventually this summer, he moved to play for Italian giant Juve in a €100 million transfer deal.
Brexit: You'll forever regret losing your car manufacturer's position
Corporate Secretary Greg Clark said: “The UK will forever regret it if it loses its world-leading position in post-Brexit car production.
He added that it was quite worrying that when Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK left the European Union without any further agreement, they would stop production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said delays at the border in the event that Brexit has no deal could lead to job loss.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactured Toyota's Auris and Avenis, produced nearly 150,000 units last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries within the European Union.
My view is that if the UK completely leaves the European Union at the end of March, then we will have to stop production at this factory,” said the CEO of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other British automakers also raised concerns about Britain leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said it would close its Mini plant in Oxford a month later.
The main concern of automakers is the risk of supply chain in the event of Brexit without another agreement.
Toyota's production line operates under the principle of \"just-in-time\" (on time), with parts delivered by suppliers in the UK and the European Union every 37 minutes for production lines under orders.
If the UK leaves the EU without another deal on March 29, there is a possibility of disruption at the border, and the industry is concerned it could lead to delays and spare parts deficits.
Toyota said the company could not keep its inventory worth more than a day at theshire plant, so it would have to stop production.
Clark said Prime Minister Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the European Union would be adjusted correctly to avoid checks at the border.
We need a deal. We want the best deal, not only to ensure success in the present, but also to make sure we get a good grasp of this opportunity,” he said in BBC Radio 4.
Evidence from Toyota as well as other car manufacturers suggests that we need to ensure that we continue the supply chain successfully.
Toyota has not announced how long it will be going to stop production, but in the long run, they warn that additional costs will reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately, workers will lose their jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and convenes at the plant, saying his members are increasingly worried: \"In my experience once I lose these jobs, there is never again.\"
A government spokesman said: “We have built an accurate and reliable plan for relations with the European Union in the future.”
The White House announces the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again
The White House announced on Sunday: President Donald Trump's senior meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be a week later - as the struggle for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court's position was continuing.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the intervention in the Russian election, links between Mr. Trump’s assistants and Russia and the possibility that the president interferes with the enforcement of justice.
Trump’s dismissal of the deputy attorney general, which followed by Mueller’s unlikely independence, has raised many rumors of Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing headphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president through the No. 25.
Rosenstein refused to report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amid speculation that he was about to resign.
Instead, his meeting with President Trump, who was visiting the United Nations General Assembly in New York, was scheduled on Thursday.
Trump said he did not want to dismiss Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid conflict with a Senate judiciary hearing between Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to spend a week investigating allegations against Kavanaugh, while delaying the full Senate vote.
President Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: \"The scheduled meeting date, perhaps this week, may see the reason for this delay because other issues are taking place in the Supreme Court.
But we will get the news soon and the press will be up to date.
Some reporters may disagree with the statement: Sanders has not held a news conference in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked her for this reason.
Sanders said the absence of news conferences was not because he didn't like TV reporters -- too much -- though she once said: \"I also agree that reporters are actually a lot of things.
She then suggested further direct links between President Trump and the press.
“The president is currently making more questions than any previous president,” she added without giving testimony: “We’ve looked at the number of press conferences.”
Sanders said there would be news conferences, but -- if the press had a direct chance of asking the president, that would be much better than talking to me.
We’ve tried a lot and you’ve seen that we’ve had to do a lot over the last few weeks, which will replace a press conference when you can speak directly to the president of the United States.
President Trump frequently answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open meetings or during news conferences when officials visit.
Press conferences are usually very rare.
This week, in New York, the president should have declared the reason, but he appeared suddenly in a strange form in front of a crowd of reporters.
Health Minister Writes Letter to European Union Employees Working in Medical Industry in Scotland to Talk About Brexit Fear
The health minister wrote to European Union employees who work in the health industry in Scotland to express their national gratitude and to expect employees to remain behind Brexit.
Health Minister Jeane Freeman sent a letter with a message to resign within six months after the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish government is committed to supporting the costs of applications to the status of residence of European citizens working in the public service industry that has been transferred.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union over Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union continue to take place, which is expected to be made this fall.
But the British government is also ramping up preparations for the scenario that may not reach an agreement.
I know this is a time of uncertainty for all of you.
That’s why I want to repeat that I appreciate every employee’s contribution now, no matter what their nationality is.
Furthermore, colleagues from the European Union have brought valuable experience and skills to help strengthen and improve health services, while also benefiting patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we look forward to you staying.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgery after having a head injury
Tigers' vertical border guard, Christion Abercrombie, underwent an emergency operation after having a head injury in a 31-27 defeat against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessee reported.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
“He ran toward the border and collapsed,” Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie a breath of oxygen at the border before putting him on the dome and taking him to another check.
A Tennessee official told Chris Harris at the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is no details about the level of injury, and Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurs.
Abercrombie, a second-year student of the Red Shirt, first played under Tennessee's shirt after moving back from Illinois.
He had a total of five matches on Saturday before being removed from the game and he had a total of 18 matches this season.
Foreigners who buy property in the UK will be charged higher taxes.
Foreigners who buy real estate in the UK will be charged higher taxes, this extra money will be used to help homeless people under Tory’s new policies.
This change will disable Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters.
Tax increases will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The finance ministry expects the policy to increase to £120m per year - to help homeless people
Foreigners who buy real estate in the UK will be more taxed - this extra money will be used to help homeless people, Prime Minister Theresa May announced today.
This change will successfully disable Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with a commitment to provide cheaper housing and target high-income audiences.
The increase in taxes will apply to individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, which will boost government efforts to combat the current stagnation.
The surcharge - in addition to the current tax rate, including higher tariffs that were announced two years ago for the second home and purchase houses just to that - could be up to three percent.
The finance ministry expects this change to increase to £120 million per year.
An estimated 13% of newly built property in London has been sold to non-British people, which pushes home prices higher and makes buyers more difficult for the first time.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially in the capital - have become a ghost town - because most foreigners buy their homes most of their time in another country.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to give many young people the opportunity to own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of holding high real estate prices by taking land but not using, he urged Prime Minister May to give up quotas for affordable homes to remedy housing accidents in Britain.
Corbyn also announced a series of housing reforms aimed at attracting voters, including controlling leases and ending deportations.
He also wanted to give councils more power to build new homes.
May said: \"Last year I said I would spend my time restoring my dream - that life would be better for the new generation.
And that means re-regulating the housing market is very chaotic now.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build lives here.
However, this does not mean that non-residents in the UK and overseas-based companies can easily buy homes as hard-working British residents.
For so many people, the dream of owning a house has become so far away and the stagnation is still huge.
Jack Ross: ‘My last aspiration is to lead Scotland’
Sunderland's boss Jack Ross said that his last ambition was to be the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
Scot, 42, is facing the challenge of revitalizing the Northeast club, which currently holds third place in League One, three points less than in the first place.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I want to play for my country as a player.
“I had a hat with a B logo and that’s what I wanted,” Ross told the BBC’s Sportsound.
“My childhood year was associated with Scotland’s games that took place in Hampton with my father, and that’s always what reminds me.
However, that opportunity will only come if I succeed in managing the club.
Sunderland's predecessors to Ross include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach Alloa Athletic said he did not feel pressure as his successor after the great names at such a big club, which he had previously rejected from the offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success to me at this moment will be judged by ‘Can I bring the club back to the Premier League?’
The institutional structure and facilities at this club are certainly part of the Premier League,” he said.
This is not a task to achieve easily, but I only consider myself successful if I can bring the club back to the tournament.
Ross had three years as manager, after a time as manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa restore his position after falling to third place, and put St Mirren from the risk of falling into the next season's champion.
Ross says he is now very comfortable during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was perhaps a real turning point - he recalled in his role as Alloa.
I really believe that I’m better suited to managerial roles than a player.
This may sound strange because I was pretty successful, well-income and achieved certain achievements as a player.
But the game is usually not easy.
There are a lot of things you face every week.
I still bear the stress and pressure of the job but I am happy with the management job.
I always wanted to do management work and now I'm doing it, I'm most comfortable being myself throughout my adult life.

The survey shows that the ideal time to enjoy a beer is 5.30 p.m. Saturday.
The summer heat has increased sales for struggling pubs in the UK but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to data, pubs and bars saw sales rise by 2.7% in July - but sales at restaurants fell 4.8%.
Peter Martin, of business consulting firm CGA, put together the data, saying: “The long-running White and the UK team in the World Cup made the sales trend of July similar to June, when pubs increased by 2.8%, the restaurants were hit harder.
Revenue in restaurants fell 1.8% in June worsened in July.
Bars and bars specialize in beverages have the fastest growth when compared to a decline in restaurants.
Food pubs are also affected by heat, though not as serious as restaurants.
It looks like people just want to drink.
Beverage sales at regulated pubs and bars increased by 6.6% in the month while food sales fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, the entertainment industry analyst and hotel RSM, said: “These results show the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales at restaurants.
It’s no surprise that restaurants continue to have trouble, sales fell 4.8% from the same period last year while cost pressure continued to rise.
The prolonged hot summer has come at the worst time for food suppliers, unknown in August when cooler weather can improve the current situation.
Total revenue growth in pubs and restaurants, including open locations, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand deployment.
Coffer Peach Tracker’s sales monitoring for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK has collected and analyzed data on performance from 47 active groups, with sales combining more than £9 billion, and that’s the industry’s benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that parents don’t know
One in five children - some at the age of 11 - has a secret social media account that parents and teachers don't know, the survey shows.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students showed that the number of pages insta has increased significantly.
The news has raised concerns about the rise of online pornography.
Twenty percent of students say they have an account to show their parents.
One-fifth of children - some 11-year-old children - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students revealed rapid growth in accounts - fake Insta - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has increased concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students say they use an account - there's no bad content to show their parents, and they also have their own accounts.
A mother accidentally found the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, and found a teenager who called on others - rape me -
According to a study by the UK Advanced Cognitive Content Association and the Headquarters Conference (HMC) in residential schools, 40% of children aged 11 to 18 have two records, and half of them have their own accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers can’t find.
Eilidh Doyle will be the representative of the athletes - at the Scottish Council of Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Council as the non-administrative director at the regulatory body's annual meeting.
Doyle is the most medal-winning athlete in Scotland, chairman Ian Beattie sees the change as a great opportunity for sports coaches to use her extensive competition experience in international arenas over the past decade.
“Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and worldwide athletic community,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to serve as the representative of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead this sport in Scotland.”
An American, who had won a gold medal for content running 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, had all four Olympic gold medals and he is now a permanent BBC commentator, who was unable to walk after a light accident.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I can't go.
Doctors say that only time will be able to answer whether I can recover or be in any condition.
It’s a tired journey but to fully recover, learn how to walk, and now I’ve been able to walk quickly!
Thanks for your encouraging messages!
Commercial dairy cleaners compare mothers with dairy cows that divide public opinion online
A company that specializes in milk cleaners divides opinion online with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers with milked cows.
To mark the launch of the product as wearable and not causing the world's first noise - consumer technology company Elvie has launched an ad inspired by satirical music videos to show the freedom that new smokers bring to mothers.
Four mothers danced in a grass-filled cow cage following a song with the following lyrics: \"Yes, I milked myself, but you didn't see any tails and -- in case you didn't realize, this isn't my breast, they're my breasts --
The song went on: \"Dream out, suck out milk, I'm feeding the kids, sucking out milk, I'm milking my girls\"
However, this ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, has caused a lot of controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from its audience, many of which have suggested that the ad was underrepresented by the dairy industry.
A bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must also be pregnant and have children to produce milk, except that the cows are robbed from their mother cows within days of birth, a writer wrote.
Elvie Milk Suction Machine is hidden inside the breastfeeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: “This can cause psychological harm to both mother and child.
Yes, why not use it to promote breastfeeding mothers?
Another commented: “This ad has nothing to do with it.”
There are people who also protect ads, a woman who admits that she sees the song - it's funny -
I think this is a unique idea.
I'll buy one if I'm still breastfeeding.
Dairy really made me feel like a cow.
This ad is crazy, but I understand its message.
It's a unique product -- someone else comments.
Another commented: “This is an interesting ad targeting mothers who need to smoke milk (usually at work or in the toilet) and they feel like they’re like cows.
This is not advertising or evaluating the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they had danced with a milk cleaner hidden in the underwear.
The idea behind this campaign is based on the fact that many women who smoke milk to breastfeed say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie dairy vacuumer does not cause noise, no wire or tube, and is kept secret inside the breastfeeding, allowing women to freely move, hold the baby and even go out while smoking milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: “The Elvie Milk Suction Machine is really a revolutionary product, worthy of a bold introduction and encourages curiosity.
When comparing women with dairy cows, we want people to know about milk products and related challenges, while also showing fun and empathy about the freedom that new dairy products bring to mothers.
This is not the first time Elvie dairy smokers have appeared on the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk of designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly move to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrants detained has spiked, although the number of monthly crossings has remained almost unchanged, in part because of the harsh reasons and policies introduced by the Trump administration has made the process of bringing children to sponsors more difficult.
Traditionally, most donors were once undocumented immigrants, and they were concerned that receiving an immigrant child could affect their ability to stay in the United States.
The increased risk in June, when federal governments announced that potential donors and other adult members of their families would have to take a fingerprint, and the data would be shared with the immigration agency.
Last week, Matthew Albance, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of applicants for funding minors without guardians.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had never had a criminal record.
Nearly 80% of sponsors or family members are illegal, and most of them have a criminal record.
So we’re continuing to trial these individuals,” Mr. Albance said.
According to employees working in refugee camps, to be able to quickly handle cases involving these children, officials have issued new regulations requiring some donors to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, according to the previous standard.
Many people will appear through video conferencing calls, rather than directly present, to justify their legal status in front of a immigration judge.
Those who are tried are deemed unable to be eligible for a sponsorship will be expelled quickly.
The longer they are held, the more they become anxious or depressed, the more this can lead to violent behavior or try to escape, according to staff at refugee camps and according to reports from the system in recent months.
Proponents say the growing concern at a larger facility like Tornillo, where they see a struggling child more likely to be ignored due to the size of the camp too large.
They added that bringing children to a city with refugee camps without having enough time to prepare themselves or saying goodbye to friends could be psychologically damaging that many children are suffering.
Syria proposes \"conservative forces\" of the United States, France and Turkey withdraw immediately from the country
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return to the country, although the civil war entered the eighth year.
Moualem, the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were already on illegal Syrian soil, in the name of counterterrorism forces, so - will be handled -
They must withdraw from Syria unconditionally and immediately - he speaks before the council.
Moualem stressed that the war against terrorism in Syria has come to an end - more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions leaving their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to fight in this holy war until we purge terrorist groups from the entire territory of Syria - and - the illegal presence of foreign forces -
The United States now has about 2,000 troops in Syria, specializing in training and mentoring both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 infantry in the country being devastated by war.
In terms of refugees, Moualem said that the country was good enough to return, and he blamed -- some Western countries -- for having been in an unreasonable fear -- that the refugees did not return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate return of refugees,” he said.
They are using political cards for humanitarian issues.
The United States and the European Union have warned there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political deal between Assad and the opposition ends the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on establishing a neutral zone in Idlib's last insurgency has created opportunities to promote political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had a clear time - and expressed the hope that military action would target militants including militants from the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda - who would be removed -
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee including the government and opposition members to draft the post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for the election.
Moualem set out conditions for the Syrian government’s involvement in the committee, saying the committee’s work was limited to considering the provisions of the existing constitution and warned not to interfere in the elections.
Why Trump Will Win in Second Term
In logical terms, President Trump will win the 2020 re-election unless impeachment and scandals put an end to the presidency ahead of time, as liberals are hoping.
This is obviously the most dramatic of a presidential term.
So far, there have been no signs of heat reduction.
Since 2014, gold-hour viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News now has 2.4 million viewers at golden hours, compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and the show, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show, topped the cable TV rankings with over 3.5 million viewers.
Despite the lack of understanding, many are still as attracted as those who burn their bodies - Neal Baer, who runs the ABC's \"Designated Survivor\" show, talks about a cabinet secretary becoming president after an attack on the destruction of the Parliament Building.
Nell Scovell, a playwright and author of the book Just the Funny Parts: and Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys - Club - has another theory.
She recalled a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
You asked why?
“He replied, ‘Because he made me laugh,’ Miss Scovell told me so.
This is an interesting thing in the chaos.
Of course, unlike what happens on TV, any move by Washington can decide the future of Roe v. Wade, or the reunification of immigrant families and the global economic situation.
Only some television audiences have the privilege of choosing their channel.
Not only that, this draws more than the news item as you take six hours to see a group of experts arguing about the use of Bob Woodward’s deep-sized source of information in the book, Fear, or Paul Manafort’s $15,000 hairbrow bomb coat, a grotesque costume, and the inconspicuous in Stormy Daniels’ oversized osteoporosis of President Trump.
I changed my view of Super Mario.
One of the things he does is always bring you something new every night that makes it look like a reality TV show, according to Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of “Pawn Stars”, when talking about casts and unexpected developments in Trump’s daily television show (such as a dance with N.F.L. or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can’t miss an episode or you won’t catch up with the trend.
This week I had a conversation with Fleiss, outside the home on the northern bank of Kauai under the 80-degree heat, but he hid in the house to watch MSNBC while recording for CNN.
He couldn’t leave the most TV screen when Brett Kavanaugh was due to be submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court being placed on the weighing table.
“I remember the days we carried out those crazy programs and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.

The money from outside poured into the toughest midterm election for the race into the White House.
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17 electoral district is witnessing a cash rain, due to the reorganization of the parliamentary sector that has forced the two incumbents to race into the same seat.
The recent geopolitical reorganization in Pittsburg County hit Democratic Representative Conor Lamb who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running with Republican candidate Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district in Pennsylvania, shares multiple boundaries with the new 17th County.
The geopolitical map was replanned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former counties were arranged for Republican favor.
The race in the new district has become a financial race between the party’s main funding institutions, the Democratic Committee on the National Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican Committee on the National Campaign (NRCC).
Lamb was a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a stellar victory in a special election watched by many in March for Pennsylvania's 18th District Congressional Area.
This position has been Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump has won 20 points in the county.
Political commentators rated the Democrats higher.
The U.S. has considered sanctions on El Salvador in favor of China, but has subsequently withdrawn.
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama recognized Beijing, Washington, barely made any objections.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and the president had owned a hotel in Panama until business partners fired Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to summon U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the recent decision to not recognize Taiwan, Heather Nauert, a spokesperson for the State Department earlier this month.
But the penalty was only considered for El Salvador, which received $140 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions on some subjects, will cause major losses to the Central American country now with high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings are ongoing, North American and Central American officials have delayed a high-level conference focused on security and economics to re-organize a similar meeting last year that has been seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials had announced that they wanted to continue the conference, helping to end the consideration of U.S. sanctions on El Salvador.
Diplomats say Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to speak at the conference, scheduled in mid-October, when there is a signal of administrative measures.
And three U.S. special envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a strong message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their information has been endorsed by an outside analyst who has close ties with the government and also speaks anonymously.
History of research
The next bomb could be a report by special counsel Robert Mueller on President Trump’s behavior of obstruction of justice, which is now a lot of evidence in public records.
People say Mueller is moving his investigation to the issue of collusion between President Trump and Russia in the presidential election.
If there is a change in the party in Congress, President Trump will have much difficulty in Congress, just before he prepares for the election, and even with those in the same party.
There are so many issues, I don’t mean to mention President Trump’s departure as an inevitable thing - just like his European counterparts.
Both sides of the Atlantic Ocean need to make choices and this will affect the length of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to conduct a coup against Hitler, if the West also agreed against and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre.
History revolves around such milestones, and the Democratic party’s unfavourable struggles will increase or delay.
Americans face some of these milestones.
What if President Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been sitting in the fire since last year's report about his proposal to secretly record the president's eavesdropping and speculation about the president's incompatibility.
Rosenstein has proven that the information of the Times newspaper is incorrect.
How would we react if the new F.B.I. investigation into Brett Kavanaugh was incomplete or unfair - or if he confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
Most of all, will we vote in midterm for a Congress so that the agency will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail in these challenges, democracy will lose power for a long time.
But I believe we will not fail, because I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish Czechoslovakian expelled to Auschwitz because the Nazi regime had occupied our home.
She survived, moved to the United States, and, 60 years later, she gave me the opportunity to light my candle on the altar on the Sabbath day.
With my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans' optimism of Rangers ahead of a clash with Rapid Vienna
Rangers fought Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning against the Austrians, following an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would give them the advantage to win the Europa League G group.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believed Rangers could use that result as a pedal for more wonderful things.
“It’s a good thing for us because Villarreal is a strong team,” the 31-year-old said.
We were in the game with the belief that we would win a point.
We should have won at the end of the game but the draw is also a bad result.
They may have played better in the first half but we were counterattacks in the second half and had better modes.
Next year, it will be an important game in Europe.
Hopefully we could win three points but it would be a tough game because they had good results in the previous match, but with the fan's contradiction, I'm sure we could get through and win good results.
Last year was a difficult period, I was injured and the changes at the club but now I have a very good feeling.
Good teams, good players with good performance and good training quality.
Hopefully we can continue to go deeper to reap a new season of success.
Women are so worried about insomnia due to retirement savings
Although the survey participants understood what they were interested in, few spoke with family members.
About half of Nationwide’s research participants said they had spoken to their spouse or husband about long-term care costs.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about this.
People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t talk about this, said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
These are the steps to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for them to take care of you if you don’t show your desire first.
Talk to your advisors and family to discuss where and how to be cared for, as those choices can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a payment method for those expenses.
Your financial options for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance policies, cash-worth life insurance policies to help cover these expenses or buy yourself insurance with your own money - as long as you have money.
Prepare legal documents: Avoid possible legal battles.
There is a health care plan available so that you can assign a trusted individual to monitor the healthcare process and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also, consider authorizing your financial account.
You should choose a trusted person to make a financial decision for you and make sure to pay your bills if you are not qualified.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
List these details so that you are always ready.
It’s not just a financial problem, but a doctor,” Martin asked.
What drugs are there?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have you planned it yet?
The man shot multiple shots with rifles in Ilfracombe

His injury was not life-threatening and the police called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, officials said the death toll was expected to rise.
Contacting was cut off, aid workers were unable to receive any information from the Donggala government, a region north of Palo near the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some of the main events of Palo and Donggala, on the island of Suwon:
Palau is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Suwon, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a capital spanning more than 300 km (180 mi) along the northwest coast of the island of Suwon.
The capital, a provincial administrative area, has an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are two key industries of the economy in the province of Suwon, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important industry here, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, the coastal side of Sulawesi.
Palo and Donggala have been hit several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also landed west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is within the Pacific Fire Belt and has frequent earthquakes.
Here are some major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that attacked 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of whom were in the province of Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes attacked the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake occurred south of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake near the city of Padang, capital of eastern Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake occurred on one of the islands of Mentawai, off the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres high, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake struck the capital Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing damage and panic when people recalled the destruction of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
The earthquake did not cause tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Large earthquakes have attacked Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly concentrated in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and Vice President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfered with a report on domestic violence and protested the arrest warrant, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to a police report, when a woman tried to call the police to report the crime he took the phone.
Palin is being detained in Mat-Su and must file a guarantee of no guarantee of $500, according to the KTUUU report.
He appeared in court on Saturday, claiming he was no crime - when asked to defend, according to the report.
Palin faces three A-class charges, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with minor Grade B, jailed for a day and fined $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the citation attack.
The case is currently in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfered with reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in the state of unconsciousness associated with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking his son's violent behavior to PTSD syndrome after his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical networks and communications have been cut off with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just outside the heart of Suwon, north-east of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
Videos posted on social media show the timing of the disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palo when the tsunami arrived.
Federal prosecutors are recommending death penalty for NYC terrorist attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are asking for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people - a rare penalty not yet conducted in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, crashing pedestrians and cyclists on 10 October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov-decided - killing eight victims and -deciding - causes serious body injuries, according to a statement on the proposed death penalty, filed in South New York County.
Both cases may be sentenced to death, according to court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury accused Saipov of indictments of 22 counts, including eight counts of intentional murder, often used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and charges of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
The attack requires a thorough plan and pre-trial attack, prosecutors say, when describing how Saipov does, is “hung, cruel, and inhuman.”
\"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini's family and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the South New York County executed the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder two drug providers but was eventually sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek, has no expression of regret following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching IS video on the phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked ISIS to hang the flag in the hospital room, police said.
He has not pleaded guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal defense lawyers representing Saipov, said they were “completely disappointed” with the prosecutor’s decision.
“We think the decision to make the death penalty rather than accept the confession of life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the damage of the event to those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to give a death penalty.
Conservative Party MPs say NigEL FARAGE must take responsibility for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage said it would be \"raising the people\" during a protest at the conservative party's conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians must \"feel the heat\" from European skeptics - because one of Theresa May's MPs has suggested he should be responsible for negotiating with the European Union.
Conservative party supporter Peter Bone said during his march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom had been \"out of the alliance\" right now if Farage was Brexit's minister.
But the challenge that Prime Minister May faced trying to reconcile the deep division between conservative parliamentarians, supporting the stay of the European Union, took part in a protest against Brexit.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain a compromise between Brexit supporters, supporters who stay and the European Union.
Allies said she would push by trying to reach an agreement with Brussels despite a backlash - and forcing European skeptics and the Labour Party to choose between her plan and \"the current chaos.\"
Bone said during the Leave Means Leave protest at Solihull that he wanted to \"contrary the Chequers plan\".
He asked Farage to stay in the Senate and be responsible for talks with Brussels.
“If he is responsible, now we are probably out of the alliance,” he said.
Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit but we need to oppose the Chequers plan.”
He testified to his opposition to the European Union: “We don’t fight in world wars to submit to others.
We want to build our own laws.”
Bone rejected the proposal that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the alliance is completely false.”
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also present at the rally, telling reporters: \"I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Not many people agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition won’t vote for this plan, which often doesn’t happen to our party, our activists, who are willing to call for people’s support and vote for us from the very beginning.
Give up the Chequers plan and listen to the people.”
In a message to Mrs May, she added: “The prime ministers keep their chair as they keep their promise to the people.”
Farage said politicians must participate in the protest to ‘feel the heat’ if they change their decision to be made in the 2016 referendum.
\"This is a matter of trust between us - the people - and the political class,\" he said.
“They’re trying to give up Brexit and we’re here today to say ‘we’re not going to let you do it.’”
In a message to his supporters, he added: “I want to let the political class, who are intending to change Brexit, feel the heat of the current situation.
“We are mobilizing people who have brought Brexit victory and we will never give up until we become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, the supporters of the stay paraded through Birmingham before holding a two-hour protest in the city centre.
Some activists raise the Conservative Party banner against Brexit after launching the group this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis has laughed at the Conservatives over the security issues they are facing when the conference is opening.
“These are people who have told us they can control the IT system and all the technologies that provide Canada, both free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
\"This is absolutely a clown.
Brexit is not a good thing,’ he added.
Warren plans to ‘elect’ the presidential chair
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would be determined to vote after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts Democrats talked about her future when speaking at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, is re-electing in November, in a race against the U.S. state representative, Geoff Diehl, who was co-president of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
People speculate that she can take on Trump’s position in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at the town hall since President Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her about her intention to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to join politics to reform the government and needed a leading woman.
Arrested in the shooting of LSU's Sims player
On Saturday, police at Baton Rouge, La., announced that a suspect was arrested in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 a.m. ET television news.
They released video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot by a bullet in his head and died,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, on the sports channel 247.
Wayde interfered to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, possessing weapons, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was immediately arrested and detained at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
As a teenager with a height of 1.98m and raised at Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 matches in the official squad last season with an average play time of 17.4 minutes, winning 5.6 points and 2.9 rounds per game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won World Championships after winning against Sebastian Vettel
Valtteri Bottas clearly had an advantage over Lewis Hamilton on Saturday when Mercedes was still a strong team in the season.
From the starting point, Bottas had a good start and went ahead of Hamilton to defend his position in the first two races and made Vettel fight with his own teammates.
Vettel entered the first pit and abandoned Hamilton when entering the track, a decisive act.
The Mercedes entered the pit after Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead due to a Ferrari rider forced to slow down in order to avoid the risk after two steps to protect the third place.
Max Verstappen began in the back row of the race and took the seventh place at the end of his 21st birthday.
He then led through the race without changing tires to reach his destination quickly and overcame Kimi Raikkonen to win fourth place.
He finally entered the pit in the 44th round but was unable to speed up the remaining eight rounds when Raikkonen took the fourth place.
It’s a tough race because Valtteri played very well on the weekend and it’s really a cool racer.
Finally, the team had an excellent race to win number one and number two, Hamilton said.
It's a very bad body language.
U.S. President Donald Trump has made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday's campaign because she insisted she didn't leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford over the Supreme Court's allegations of sexual assault in Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking in a campaign on the West Virginia coast, the president did not directly target the announcement issued by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which instead commented that what is going on in the Senate shows that people have bad intentions and are not honest.
“There’s been something going on and what’s going on in the last few days in the Senate that’s great, you can feel anger, you can see people who are angry, bad and uncomfortable and dishonest,” the president said.
When they looked at the articles and read the leaked news, they said, “Well, I’m not the one to do it.”
I didn't do that -
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, you leaked the news, right?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document, right? - Well, what's going on?
No, no.
I'm not leaking.
Come on, wait a minute.
We leaked out... No, we didn't do it -- the president did what the senator said.
Feinstein was sent by Ford to detail the allegations against Kavanaugh in July and the information was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that her office leaked information.
“I don’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I don’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
She asked me to keep secret and I kept secret as she asked.
But the president seemed unsatisfied about her rejection behavior and he commented on Saturday night’s campaign: “I’m going to tell you about it, it’s really bad body language.
She probably didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continued to protect the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president said Democrats are using charges for their own purposes.
They are determined to regain power in every way.
You will see meaning and discomfort because they don’t care who will hurt, they want to have power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars won 5-3 against Belfast Giants

Air traffic controllers have lost their lives to save hundreds of passengers on board from the earthquake.
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia are being praised as a hero after their sacrifice to ensure that the plane carries hundreds of passengers can take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a major earthquake occurred on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong tremors continue to rage in the area and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palo.
Although his colleagues fled to keep their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the control tower shaking because of the strong winds at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air traffic control tower because he thought it collapsed.
Then he died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision saved lives, according to Australian newspaper ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he stopped breathing before the plane arrived in Palo.
“Our hearts are broken when we receive this news,” he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, spokesman for the National Disaster Relief Agency said it was difficult to reach the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The number of deaths continues to rise as many bodies remain trapped under the ruins and we have not yet reached many people,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The waves, up to six metres high, have devastated Palermo, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military aircraft and commercial aircraft provide supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance is carrying the bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Small markets are being sacked everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross is racing to support survivors but we don’t know how the situation is there.
This is a tragedy, but the situation can get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived on Sunday and told the National Army: “I hope you will all work day and night to complete every mission related to the evacuation.
You are not ready yet, CNN reported.
Earlier this year Indonesia was attacked by earthquakes in Lombok, including more than 550 people.
Flight Accidents in Micronesia: Air Niugini says there is still a man missing after crashing a plane at the seaside
Flight operators crashed at the Pacific Strait in Micronesia said there was still a man missing, after a previous statement that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that until Saturday afternoon we were unable to find a male passenger.
The airline said it has worked with local agencies, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about passengers, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airlines said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them remained stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact chain of events has not yet been clearly identified.
The U.S. Air Force and Navy both said the plane landed at the sea immediately after leaving the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had been missing the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was at a very low altitude.
“This is a good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others could cross deep waters to reach emergency exit doors on the plane.
He said flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and he suffered minor injuries at his head.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who worked nearby repairs the port bridge also helped rescue by using a boat to pick up people on the shore before the plane sank about 30 metres (100 feet) deep.
Data from the aviation safety network shows that 111 people have died in the crash of airlines registered in the PNG network over the past two decades, but none of them have been involved in Air Niugini.
Analysts say the girl was burned alive on the night.
The party was based on Saturday's filings during a review of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett has been testifying in court for hours as an intelligence analyst.
He demonstrated to the jury how to use a mobile record to synthesize the movement of accused Quinton Tellis, 21, and victim Jessica Chambers, 19, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from a number of mobile phones showing that Tellis was with the Chambers on the evening she was dead, contradicting his previous statement, the Clarion Ledger reported.
The data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambers' phone while he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, who questioned Sanford.
Sanford testifyed in court on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sandford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistencies is Tellis saying he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records show that they only know each other in about a week.
Rowlett said that occasionally after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and communications from his phone.
“He removed her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense attorney is expected to begin closed arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury's trial that day.
High Breed: What is a positive hip hop?
The hip hop artist trio wants to object to the negative perceptions of the genre by putting positive messages into his music.
The High Breed group, from Bristol, claims hip hop has no longer communicated political messages and solved social issues.
The group wanted to bring the genre back to its origins and popularize the positive hip hop music.
Artists such as the Fugees and Commons have been more famous in the UK recently thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
The NY girl sued the couple who fired her after a racist message.
A child in New York Nanny sued a couple who fired her for discrimination after she missed receiving a false message from her mother complaining that she was a black person.
The couple rejected them as racists, viewing the case as a money-sacrificing case.
Lysey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed depression when she discovered the new breast, Oleg Maurice, who was black on her first day of employment in 2016.
· NOT yet, SUPPORT A DISCLAIMER Plasco-Flaxman has texted her husband such a message.
However, instead of sending a message to her husband, she sent Maurice twice.
After realizing the confusion, Ms. Plasco-Flaxman, who had fired her Maurice, said that the African-born breast was about to leave for a bad job and that she hoped to have a Filipino breast, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid on the day and went to Uber on her own.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple to claim compensation for layoffs with $350 a day for a six-month period for the job she was hired to receive money despite not signing any contract.
“I want to show them, look, you don’t have to do that,” she told Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.
The couple objected to the allegations that they were racists, saying that Maurice's end to work was reasonable for fear that they could not trust her after offending her.
“I sent her a message she didn’t intend to send.
She's not a racist.
We’re not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
But can you give your child to someone you have offended, even by confusion?
What about the baby?
Let's say it --
When comparing the lawsuit with a money-loss case, Plasco said his wife had been giving birth for two months and was in a difficult situation.
How would you deal with someone like that?
This isn’t something to do,” the investor added.
While the legal case is taking place, the flow of opinion of public opinion has quickly sprang into the couple on social media, defamation of their behavior and the logic of the story.
Publisher Paddington fears that readers will not be interested in the story of a bear who speaks, the letter said.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel was born shortly after the book was widely accepted by readers, the letter revealed: “It’s hard to put yourself in someone else’s place when reading the book for the first time.
It’s great to know now about Paddington’s great success.
When it comes to his father, a filmmaker for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book from a small toy bear, he still feels optimistic when her work was rejected, she shared further in the 60th anniversary of the book's publication, which was a confusion - after his death last year.
When she spoke of Paddington, she described it as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father was always quietly proud of her success.
He's a pretty depressed man, and he's not an explosive man, she says.
But because Paddington really exists with him, it’s almost the same as you have a child and it’s achieved certain success: you’re proud of them even if they don’t really exist.
I think you looked at Paddington's work that way.
Although it was the product of his creativity and imagination, he always won a certain position for Paddington.
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye by phone.
As soon as she landed her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life but were useless.
“I called Nad regularly to say this was bad and she didn’t seem to suffer like that,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received a call from Nad saying she would stop breathing for two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, \"Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll see you soon.
I'll always be with you.
Doctors pumped heart aids and slowly pulled the tube out of her body.
She stopped breathing several times and this is the last time.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all of this wasn’t over yet.
I couldn’t cry or cry or cry because I was with my family and everyone.
I have to be the one who joins them.
In the end, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, who is still sad due to her daughter's departure, boarded the plane along with other passengers, facing the challenge she would have to overcome.
No one knows - you said.
I bow my head and cry all the time.
It was hard to explain, but when I was on the flight I felt pity for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her.
A sad woman posts postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost their suicide loved ones are trying to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted cards on the Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Davis' son Tyler, who was 13 years old, suffered from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to be in the sense that I have to go through every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a grin.
Everyone knows about it for laughter.
They used to say the boy’s laughter light up every room.
However, it quit before committing suicide because it finds itself in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, left as his brother after finishing his life.
Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that there will be a chain reaction.”
Ms. Davis designed the cards -- to let people know that there are always people who can meet, chat or even make friends.
Don't live in silence - you need to talk -
Humphreys, a friend of Davies for many years, lost her partner Mark 15 years ago, shortly after his mother’s death.
“He’s not talking about feeling bored or disappointed or anything like that,” she says.
A few days before Christmas, we saw him change his attitude.
He's tired of school on Christmas Day - when the kids open their gifts and he doesn't want to keep an eye on them or anything around him -
She said her husband's death was a huge loss to them, but they still had to try to overcome: \"This has caused a big flaw in our family.
It broke our hearts.
But we all continue to live and fight with it.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is suspended as the FBI begins investigating
Flake said on Saturday that \"I think, if we can actually get something like what he asked for -- a limited time investigation, the scope limit, we can collect a little -- he added that he was afraid that the committees would -- get caught up in -- the party's slumps.
Why does Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their lack of time is just a matter of time.
Inter-term elections have gone through five weeks, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans are now in a very bad situation will be weaker in their efforts to find the representative they want to vote for.
George W. Bush called senators, lobbying in support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who had served as White House assistant under President Bush, and had been able to reach out to his wife Ashley, who had been President Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI released reports?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats will vote.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh could receive at least 50 Senate votes, which would allow Mike Pence, now vice president, to remove the knot and confirm the candidate's position in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Koreans who defected under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors has fallen sharply since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean unification ministry, said last year there were 1,127 defects - compared to 2,706 defects in 2011.
Park said tightening border control between North Korea and China and the large percentage of smugglers arrested were key elements of the change.
Pyongyang has not made public comments.
Most defectors from North Korea were eventually granted Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most defectors flee through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea, and they can easily cross the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two countries.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return.
The relationship between North Korea and South Korea - technically still in war - has improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on denuclearization.
The moves came after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, both sides agreed with extended terms to advance to the Korean peninsula denuclearization.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-Ho blamed U.S. sanctions for causing progress.
“Without any trust on the U.S. side, there would be no confidence in our national security and in such a case, there would be no other way that we would unilaterally find our own disarmament,” Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh \"extreme\" and said he was not suitable for the position at the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called the nominee for his position in the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, a \"excitant\" and said he was temporarily inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help, but I think if a woman had done so, they would call it ‘extreme,’” Pelosi said of his response to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh insisted on refusing allegations that he had sexually attacked Dr Christine Blasey Ford when they were both minors.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh expressed a lot of emotions, at times when he almost cried and was grappled when he spoke about his family and five months of high school.
He also strongly condemned the Democratic Party before the committee, calling the charges against him an act - a carefully planned watch - out of anger because Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was not suitable for his position at the Supreme Court, as he clearly expressed his anti-democratic behavior.
“I think he eliminated his status by making his statements and treatment when talking about the Clinton family and the Democratic Party,” she said.
Pelosi declined when asked if she would try to accuse Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats won the majority of the votes in the House of Commons.
\"I would say this -- if he didn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he wouldn't just be in a position at the Supreme Court, but he would have to explain it to the court,\" Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the appeal court in D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was interested in Kavanaugh's ability to make a ruling against the Money-Global Health Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
During the hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he changed some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
“It’s not a time for an overstimulator, biased in court, and hopefully we’ll say, ‘This isn’t great,’” Pelosi said.
Women need to take advantage of it.
This is really a heavy criticism, month after month, year over year, the greater the anger, and she can’t pass without crying.
We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me after 45 years.
I don’t think that’s unusual, but friends.
She continued, \"I was greatly helped by a woman, she was senior director, she said she also cried when she was angry but to form a reaction when she was angry and started crying, she would tell the person she had just said, \"You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry -
And you keep crying.
And I think this is great.
You are allowed to cry so that this behavior is part of an outlet for anger because they are basically being misunderstood.
One of my deepest memories of working at the first company was that it was a place for men only, I cried when there was anger, which was when I was hit by an older woman -- the cold manager who always scared me -- pulled me into the stairs.
She told me - Never let them see you crying.
They don't know you're angry.
They thought she was sad and pleased that they were with her.
Patricia Schroeder, later a Democrat in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and left the race, Schroeder was deeply disappointed that there was no reason for her to run for president.
30 years later she laughed and told me it wasn’t a wise decision.
There were seven other candidates in the race, and they needed another candidate.
Some have called this race \"Snow White and Seven Pigs\"
Due to her late participation in the campaign, she was lost in the fundraising campaign, so she swore she would not be involved in the campaign unless she raised $2 million.
The war failed.
She found that some of her supporters gave her $250 instead of $1,000 to support the male candidate.
I wonder if they think I’m undervalued.
When she announced that she would not launch an official campaign, she overcame her emotions - expressing gratitude to those who supported her, disappointed with the system that made it harder for the fundraising process and targeting voters rather than the delegates, she was angry at being sexist - that she had come to the niche.
“You might think I’ve had a nerve failure,” Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press had responded to me.
You thought Kleenex was a sponsor of my company.
I remember thinking about what they were going to put on my gravestone?
Do you cry without -
The U.S.-China trade war could be a good signal for Beijing
Experts say the start of the trade war between the U.S. and China has been stalled, and the war will continue, the crackdown between countries could be an advantage for Beijing.
Earlier this year, Donald Trump, president of the United States, issued his first warning by taxing China’s main exports including solar panels, steels and aluminum.
The growing escalation in recent weeks with a £200 billion tax rate (£150 billion) hit half of Chinese goods imported into the United States.
Beijing has responded by raising tariffs from five to ten percent to $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China is committed to retaliatory in line with U.S. actions and the world’s second-largest economy can hardly be shaken early.
Getting Washington to make concessions means that Beijing has to make demands, but publicly losing to the U.S. is too ashamed for Xi Jinping, president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing could come up with the right flag, the long-term pressure of the trade war with the United States could be a positive signal for China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact is that a political decision in Washington or in Beijing can begin an economic relationship in either country and this is actually far more dangerous than what was previously acknowledged, says Abigail Grace, a research expert focused on Asia at the new American Security Center.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, Foreign Minister said.
Syria says it is ready for refugees to volunteer to return and is calling for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by the more than seven years-long war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
Today, the country's situation is more stable and secure thanks to the progress in the fight against terrorism - if it is clear.
The government continues to reform areas destroyed by terrorists to restore living conditions.
All conditions are now ready for refugees to voluntarily return because they have left the country because of terrorism and economic conditions affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian people have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that finance the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup against the United States with the final score of 16.5 -10,5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team got 14.5 points when he defeated the American team.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who took part in most of the tournaments, threw his kick into the water at his third play in the 16th hole, acknowledging he had lost to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shines in all rounds and became one of four players who have won 5-0-0 since the current season began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated at 5 & 4 by the lowest ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world’s top-ranked player, Düstin Johnson, has lost 2-1 to the British team’s Ian Poulter, who may have played the final Ryder Cup match in his career.
A veteran player of eight Ryder Cup seasons, Sergio Garcia of Spain has become the greatest champion of all tournaments with a total score of 25.5.
I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t stop this.
This is really a tough year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing and trusting me.
I’m very happy to get a cup.
“As for my team, I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said of feelings after the European victory.
He transferred the torch to his fellow fellow John Ram, who had defeated American legend Tiger Woods with 2 to 1 in the single game on Sunday.
“It’s a great pleasure to be able to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up and admire him,” said Rahm, 23-year-old.
Woods lost all four matches in France and currently has a record 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup tournaments.
The statistics of one of the greatest players of all time suggest he has won 14 major titles and is behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team tried their best to find tickets for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who were the league’s highly qualified players.
Captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, \"I'm proud of the players, they fought very well.
We had trouble this morning due to high temperatures in Europe.
We've been eliminated.
Please honor Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 players in the team play very well.
We will refocus the squad, I will play the PGA in the United States and the Ryder Cup and we will continue to win the top.
I love all 12 players and I am proud to be the captain.
I'm going to say hello to you guys.
We played very excellently.
Updated on the red tide phenomenon: Red tide density decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Association shows that the density of the Red tide has decreased in much of the Tampa Bay area.
According to FWC, the flowering algae phenomenon has been reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - which cause the red tidal density to decline.
The red tide spread around 130 miles along the northern coast of Pinellas to the south of Lee County.
Small arrays are also found within 10 miles off Hillsborough County, but less places than last week.
It was also observed that the red tide phenomenon in Pasco County was observed.
The average density along the coast or off Pinellas County has been reported over the past week, from low to high on the coast of Hillsborough County, from low to high in Manatee County, high to high in Sarasota County, low to high density to Charlotte County, low to high density along the coast or offshore in Lee County, and low density in Collier County.
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
Respiratory stimuli was not reported in northwestern Florida last week.
