Congressing delegates at the convention of anxiety can be a problem that may arise in the discussion of the opposite direction.
One Lao Party said that his party was worried that the word would be spell with Twp and Pwp.
For readers who are not native of Wales: in Wales, twp means temporary and pwp.
One representative of the Greer pointed out that all of the parties were unsatisfying, and offered other names.
As for a member of the Republican party, he shared his party with the party, without prejudice, but didn't forget to mention MWP turning into Muppet.
In terms of the word mammoth’s w is spoken similar to that of the English - speaking Sanctuaries.
The Congress Committee is now planning a bill with the change of name, stating: “The final blood of any of the delegates will naturally be the concern of the delegates.
Wales’s State Act in 2017 was changed by its own name.
In June the committee announced the result of a civil convention on proposals to find a basis for the name of the Society, Wales.
In view of the name of Congress, the committee for the state of state of Wales or WMP, but the demand resulted in the trend of the senator of Wales.
Congress are publicly making other projects, but the most objectives can be a concern for the election director, Elin Jones, who is assigned to be assigned to the bill plan for change for the next few weeks.
Project of correction would include changes in the way the national system works, including the regulations of the Congress convention and the design of the government.
Congressors will present the final vote for the question they should be changed when they contribute to the discipline plan.
The people of Macedonia votes on the civil demand for change of country.
The votes vote on Sunday for whether they change their name of the nation into the North Macedonia.
The total votes were established in an effort to resolve a period of decades of struggle with Greek neighbors, where there was also a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of the northern neighboring country corresponds to its own territory and has repeatedly opposed being members of the EU and the U.N. of your country.
President Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, a member of the team who betrayed the national name, declared to reject the votes.
However, the supporters of the civil demand, including General Zoran Zaev, claiming that change was the key price to joining EU and U.S.A.
The St. Martin Floki entered his mouth when it happened at Derrick.
Despite my historical background, older men whom I have been exposed have had a bar and a church in which Adams spoke.
Until today, there's no church without bar.
He saw that the disappearing of bars was acceptable.
He said that today the Son of man has many ways to communicate.
They're no longer public living rooms where people come back often
As for the churches, he was concerned that the money from selling property would not last as fast as the leaders expected, and sooner or later all would come back at the start of the line.
In addition, these churches may be replaced by buildings that are associated with various cross - cross - cross buildings, which will do no good in keeping local respect.
He added: a small part of the people who buy apartments in those buildings will be white, and then the churches will be closed faster than ever because there's no reason why people in these apartments will become citizens here.
Both churches were built by white councils before Alvarez became a city for black community of Metropolitan in the 1870 ’ s, becoming St. Martin's a decade later.
The first white overseers moved in the 1930s.
A nearby army of colored missionaries took over their location.
St. Martin's has been taken over by a black church under the administration of the parent John Howard Johnson, who was head of a odd-browing diet on 125 Street, a shopping street in Porter, a man who fought against the rent or urged the coloreds.
A fire in 1939 caused the building to ruin, but when Cha Johnson’s church planned to rebuild, they laid the bell.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Cha Johnson and successor at St. Martin's, proud to call the bell of the poor
The seven - month - old expert picked up the bell call with another name: A cultural treasure, and a historical treasure.
Master, Tiffany came from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bell in the world that was played by a colored musician, Dionio A. Lind, who pursued a greater bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriamweather said that St. Martin's didn't replace you.
What happened at St. Martin's over the last few months was a complex story of architects and writers, some of which were given by church leaders, other matters by the New Catholic Church.
The religious administration manager, including religious leaders, mentioned in July with the concerns that the doctrine was going to be entrusted with, would be able to deliver the cost - free trade to the management manager, although they were not involved in the rent of architects and houses.
Some religions are not pleased with the lack of transparency on the part of their religion.
The shark attacked 13-year-old sea divers in California.
A shark attacked and got a 13-year-old boy hurt when he was in the dive in California last Saturday, the first day of the fishing, the authorities.
It happened before 7:00 a.m., right near the Beacon's coast at Scynitas.

Hammel shared that he initially claimed that it was just an exciting scream when he caught up, but then he discovered that the boy was crying: ‘ I was bit!
I'm bited
The entire boy's entire bone was revealed to him by Hammel as soon as he got to the boy.
I told everyone to get out of the country immediately: ‘ There are sharks there, Hammel.
The boy was moved by airplane to Ben Rady's Hospital in San Diego, where he was in insurance, in a state of danger.
The shark is a criminal in an unknown attack.
The rescue agent, Captain Larry Giles shared in a press conference that they discovered a shark in this area a few weeks ago, but they decided that it wasn't a dangerous shark.
Giles adds that the victim suffered a severe trauma at the top part of his body.
The officials have closed doors into the beach from the Ponto coast of Casablad to Kadi's in Ecinitas in 48 hours who served the purpose of investigation and safety.
Giles reveals that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not at risk.
The strategy to enter the beautiful market in England of Sainsbury's.
Sainsbury's pushing Boots, Superdrug and Debwehams with traditional performances, where there are always experts.
It's part of a huge tip to the market that's worth 2,8 billion pounds of English, where it's going to continue to grow while the fashions and propertys go down, the bigger goods are going to be tested in 11 countries over the country, and then it's expanded in more than five years if possible.
The investments of good work show up when the supermarkets search for ways to make good use of the shop instead of TV, cellhouses, and furniture.
Sainsbury's said that the first time they added their beautiful product to 3,000 products, including brands like Revon, Eseie, Tweezman and Dr. PawPaw.
The brands that are available as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have extra space with brands like display in store like at Boots.
Superstitions are also restoring their Boutique product line so that most of the products are simple plants -- what's getting younger customers hunting.
In addition, Fragrance Shyp will test the cost at two Sainsbury's, the first store was opened up in Croydon, south of London, the other week before the second door open at Slly Oak, Bimingham, the last year.
buying online and moving to buy a small amount of food every day at local convenience stores means more than they have to put into more blood in attracting customers.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury's, says that stores are going to be more like store store stores when the market chain tries to meet from Aldi and Lidl with more food services and non-servies.
Sainsbury's, put Argos' stores in hundreds of stores and also introduced some Hotats' booths since they bought both brands two years ago, which motivated the sales and made it more useful.
Super town used to try to lift up the beauty and the poison but fail.
Sainsbury's tried business with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but cooperation ended after having a problem about how to divide sales from the goods in the supermarkets.
The new strategy was given after Sainsbury's sold away 221 of his goods to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds' drug chain, for the price of 125 million pounds three years ago.
Being told by Lloyds would contribute to a part of the plan, by increasing a series of luxury skin brands including La Roche-posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Sainsbury's business director, said: \"We've changed our appearance and feeling of good things to raise our environment for our clients.
We've also invested in special training for staff, who'll give advice directly.
The variety of brands are designed to suit all sorts of needs and environment, as well as convenient locations, which means that we are now a hot stop, challenge traditional shopping.
Peter Jones was ‘ angry after Holly Willoughby pulled out of the contract of 11 million pounds
Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones, was angry after the Holly Willoughby TV director pulled out of 11 million pounds of business to focus on her new contracts with Mark and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the furniture brand and their Turuly.
The couple's business is likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand.
The 37-year-old program of this Morning show up Instagram to inform you that you're leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den, made Peter Jones's star angry when she pulled away from their super-collar business at the end of the minute - to focus on her new contracts with Marks Spencer and ITV.
In a tense meeting at Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire at Marlow, Buckinghamshire, sources say Jones was angry when the gold girl of the program acknowledged that her new contracts were worth a million pounds - which means she had no time to pay for their labor and dependents.
The business is likened to Gwneth Paltrow's career as Gwneltrow's Cheltrow brand and is thought to be twice the amount of property estimated 11 million pounds of Willoughby's Willoughby.
When the 37-year-old star Willoughby went to Instagram to inform you that she was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left England to go to one of his vacations.
One source for good: I'm now, Truly is Holly's top priority.
It was supposed to be her long future that might be with her for the next few decades.
Your decision to leave is amazing.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, which is very close to the opening.
There's a storage of goods at Marlow headquarters ready to release.
Experts believe that the departure of the director of this Morning program, one of the most born stars in England, may cause the company to pay millions of dollars by putting their hands on the products from the cane and candles to the furniture and furniture, and the ability to back up at the moment of the product.
And that could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby’s mother and her husband are becoming close to Jones and Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby had founded Turuly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, as president of March.
The couples went on vacation together, and Jones had 40% of the stocking company of Kremlin.
Willoughby will become the ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin to become ITV'm Aelebrity's guide.
A close source with Jones shared last night that we wouldn't comment on his business.
It's a big fight, ‘ I'm in deep love with each other. ’
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media because he had given a comment that some would view as unsatisfied of the authority of the leader of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Pip give up so much?
Mr. Pissp spoke in a tone of voice.
I'm not giving up.
He mentioned that Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June when he said that this was a major development in nuclearization in Korea.
But nuclear negotiations have been suspended.
Over three months after the 6th international convention in Singapore, the leading leader of the South Korea said to the world leaders at the seventh League of Korea that North Korea did not recognize the fulfillment of the U.S.A. from the United States to the first weapons of North Korea.
Instead, he said that the United States is continuing to take measures to increase pressure.
Mr. Pip had a much more optimistic view of his campaign talk.
We're doing great with Korea. You said.
We're going to fight Korea.
Millions of people may be killed.
Now we're in this good relationship.
He said that the efforts to improve his relationship with Kim brought positive results -- to end the missile trials, to help the child to be free and bring the bones back home.
And he protected his unusual approach when he spoke about his relationship with Mr. Kim.
It's easy to become president, but instead of 10,000 outsiders trying to get to this hard area, we have about 200 people standing right there.
The Earth and the Kingdom Hall of Indonesia
For example, after the disaster from Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs said that they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of Lombok's population were missing, no declaration of national disaster was given, a crucial condition for international aid.
Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very careful not to ask international aid, so that's a very challenging challenge to Mrs. Sumbung.
WhileSave the Childen is gathering a group to move to Palu, they're not sure if the foreign agent can work in this area.
Mr. Sutto, spoke of the national disaster agency, stating whether Indonesia's officials are judging the situation in Palu to see whether the international institutions are allowed to contribute to the aid efforts.
Despite the ongoing earthquake that Indonesia has to undergo, this country has not yet been well prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, such places were not common in other locations.
Although the warning was effective, the lack of tsunami alerts in Palu is likely to lead to human harm.
At the high point, moving between Indonesia’s islands is a challenge.
An ear that needs to be even more complicated.
An ambulance saved at Lombok in order to cure the earthquake victims who were on their way to Palu, but it would take at least three days to reach where it had just happened.
President Joko Widodo made his progress in improving Indonesia's old infrastructure into a center of his election campaign, and he wasted his money on building roads and bars.
But financial loss caused Joko’s government trouble when he faced the election next year.
Joko was also faced with pressures from the clergy that had not yet ended in Indonesia, when members of the majority of Islam pursued a more subtle form of protection in faith.
More than 1,000 lives and tens of thousands of people are out of their homes when gangs and Muslims go down on the streets, using swords, bows, and other corrupt weapons.

Congress's Cromwell statue becomes the latest imagination to endure the story of history.
It would be like a justice poem for the destruction of many religious rabbis who joined him, when they destroyed countless British buildings and religions.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick as a fool and a force to re-read history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, says: “It's impossible to avoid arguments about leaving the characters of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace that will become today.
The symbol of civil war in England was not given or performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell was wrong because of the actions of Mr. Thomas and his father in the past.
Lord Cromwell, Mr. William Hamo Thasycroft is evidence of 19th century's opinion and is part of the history of a man that many believe is still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith shared with the Sunday Telegraph, Mr. Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: perhaps in the late 19th century, Cromwell was considered to be the national protection against the outside pressure, in his mind, of course the regime.
Even if it's a completely accurate dictionary for the subject in the historical debate that goes on.
What's certain is that the conflict between the 17th century foreshadowed the next development of our country and Cromwell is a typical figure of division.
Your accomplishments as a defender of God are also worthy of honor and recognition
The defense of China's capital is the capital of China.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southern China market, according to local media.
The man, known as the name of Yuan, was found dead with his veins cut off, the whole body of blood in a cage near a barn in the G.R.R.R. Hall, the South Chinan Post reported on Sunday.
A pig shepherd prepares to inject his pig with a pig on May 30, 2005 in Western Brazil, the Mediterranean province of China.
He was said to move with his cousin from the Southern province of Korea on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, their cousin found out that he had died, and he saw a door of pigs right next to open the door.
He said that in the cage was a big ram with blood on the inside.
The report of a medical test confirms that the pig weighs 550 pounds that attacked the farmer to death.
My brother’s legs were covered with blood and no longer being intact; they were known by his brother by his name, Royung Evening News.
Security cameras show that Mr. Yuan has arrived at the market around 4.40 in the morning to feed the pig.
Then about an hour later, he was discovered dead.
The killer pig is not a pig in our brothers' pigs.
A market manager shared with Eveing News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market administration were thought to be dealing with your usual payments for death.
Although it was not popular, the attack by pigs was reported earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious hurt to her husband.
Ten years ago, a pig weighed 650 pounds on a farmer of Wales into his drawer until his wife threatened the animal to run away.
After a farmer in Oregon ate flesh in 2012, a farmer shared in CBC News that pigs often had no violence but blood smell that could play a role in their role.
They just want to be close.
They're curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just need to love them as much as he knows.

Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain in Mexican parts by Monday.
Then the temperature of low pressure will cause massive rainfall in the West for the next few days.
In the local area, the amount of rain from one to four inches is going to cause dangerous scans, fragments, and even excavations in the desert.
The temperature will cause the amount of rain to reach two to three inches per hour at points, especially in the southern part of Nevada and Arizona.

The scans can happen as bad conditions go quickly as the rainfall is scattered.
The situation would be extremely difficult if the risk of walking into the desert when there was a threat from the rain.

More than 20 million people follow Brett Kavalaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people have been watching the birth of the fifth day on the sixth day of the television system of the Supreme Court of Brett Katnaugh and the woman who accused him of an act of sexual assault was said to have happened in the 1980s, Christine Bousey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political code continues, with frequent air waves disrupted by the last minute of Friday: an agreement was made by Senator Jeff Flake to conduct an investigation on a week of charges.
Ford told the Senate attorney that she was 100% sure that Kavalaugh was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavalaugh, in his calm state, said that he certainly did not happen.
It is possible that over 20,4 million people have been watching the hearing, according to Nielsen points out in reports on Friday.
The company has counted an average on the ABC, CBS, NBC, CN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately included to other television stations including PBS, C-CN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen has a lot of problems when we're looking at people in the office.
In order to assign a parallel, the number of audiences is similar to that of a top-level ticket game or an Oscar prize.
Channel Fox News, who has given the program a strong support to appoint Kavalaugh, has led all over the palaces with the average five and a half million people on the hearing during the entire day, Nielsen share.
ABC is standing second with 3,26 million people.
CBS and 3,1 million, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million and CN are 2,52 million, Nielsen.
The concern is still very big after the hearing.
Flake is the central character in the noise of Friday.
After the Republic's peaceable characters had just declared that he would vote for Kavaaugh, he had been watched by CN and CBS on Friday that he had been screamed by the protester when he tried to move the elevator to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
He stood with his eyes pointed down for a few minutes when he was questioned, which was lively on CNN.
I'm standing here in front of you. A woman said.
Do you think he says the truth to the whole country?
He was accused that you are powerful when too many innocent women
Flake said before the elevator shut down that his office had made a statement, that he would have much to say at the hearing of the committee.
All the cable and television stations are now covered for hours later, when the Justice Committee will have to vote on whether Mr. Bretvalaugh was recommended.
But Flake said that he would just do that when he knew that the FBI would consider the charges against the candidate next week, something some of the dominant Democratic Party urged.
Flake was convinced part of part of the conversation with her partner, Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and some senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was heavy, for it was clear that the Republicans wouldn't have the Kavalaugh board for no investigation.
President Lupep opened up an FBI investigation on charges against Kavalaugh.

Menga's fall has won 1-0 for Livingston before Welves
Previously on Dolly Menga's Guide helped Livingston to win.
Livingston's on surprise for the time this Ibrox team was led by Steven Gerrard with just two losings in 18 fights.
Dolly Menga's desk proved the difference when Gary Whistler's side raised Hibernian in just a few seconds.
Gerrard's team hasn't won the difference in this season's class and facing those who lead Hearts, lead by eight points, on Sunday.
Before that, Adam and Eve took Rapid Vienna to the League prize on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston, has extended his failed chain in six games, when coach Cyril has eaten his defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed the opportunity to fight under the Army.
The Petro's team should have led before they had a desk, with their direct strategy that caused Walis to have a lot of difficulty.
Scott looked up but crossed the target, then Alan Lithgow could only direct his efforts to lead the ball to Craig Halkett across the bridge.
The host was confident to set before them, knowing that they could cause trouble to the company with their own techniques.
And that's the strategy for the destination score.
Walcs provided a punishment and Livingston lead first, Declan Gallagher and the name of Menga, who had made a single point in the middle of the bridge.
At this point, Gress has taken over the ball but has noticed that the line of defense is not going through and that Kelly Kelly's master has almost had no difficulty,
The next match, though Alfredo Morelos received help from Kelly.
Scott Petroman has failed under his men's feet into Walsh Arbor and Lithgow turn into another Livingston play.
The cremations are constantly in the current frame of Livingston and are constantly sealed, when there are two puppies of Halkett's challenge to the replacement instead of Glenn Middleton, one because of the touch of the ball - was succeeded.
'Comput' with Livingston
From Alasdair Lamont of Scotland at Tony Macaroni University.
A result and a favorable match for Livingston.
It's a very brilliant team, and it's going to be a long way from the back of the line.
Their game style and players have rarely changed since they got back to their head, but their situation is significant because of the way you've been sharpening your team since you showed up.
You've got too many strong players.
Captain Halkett is a general man who organizes a wonderful defense, while Menga, constantly holds Goldson and Joe Worall.
But Adams had a lack of inspiration.
As in Gerrard's time, they didn't achieve those standards.
The last failed to open the host’s front yard - and it's a warning to Walnuts, the ballball team in the middle of the board.

It's very rare that the tropical heat hit Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen next week when Rosa's power guards were still in the West, still carrying the risks of the scan.
The National Earthquakes have launched surveillance on the Monday and Tuesdays to the South Arizona and East Nevada, South California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flag file, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake.
Rosa expected to follow a straight path through Phoenix on Tuesday, but there was rain on Monday night.

Other parts of the South Sea of Galilee include central Rockies, and the Mediterranean will probably be one to two inches from one to two inches, with a range of isolated levels that can reach up to 4 inches.
With unsurpassed areas, the rain from the storm of Rosa could be a good sign because it's droughting.
Although floods are deeply deeply concerned, some waterfalls may be happy because the South African area is experiencing drought.
According to weather report, the U.S. team report that only 40 percent of the Arizona area are experiencing extreme droughts, but they're still second in the same category.
First of all, Rosa's palace went by and left all over the Baja California island in Mexico.

Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at Arizona border early on the third day in the low rain pressure, then scan it through Arizona and release it into South Utah on Tuesday night.
The major threat from Rosa or its ruins is that of great rain in Baja California, North Sonora and the South American desert of states.

Kavalaugh ‘ Bearing selfish, angry's rage
Such a vote for Judge Kavalaugh is a vote to reject the cruel and excessive tactics of the Democratic Party, Mr. Pip said during a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Mr. Pip says that Mr. Kavalaugh, whose selfishness, anger is the Democratic party during his campaign.
Kavalaugh objected before Congress on the fifth day, denying strongly and determined a charge from Christine Blasey Ford that he attacked her for decades before they were a teenager.
Ford also witnessed at the hearing about her accusation.
The president said that on Saturday, the American people witnessed excellentness and virtues and courageousness of Kavalaugh that day.

Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake, tsunamis in Indonesia, increase
At least 384 people were killed, many were moved when giant waves hit the beach, when an earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia’s island, the authorities told me that on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in a festival on the coast of Palu on Friday when the waves reached six feet [18 feet] on the shore at sunset, filled many people with death and destroyed everything on their way.
The gods followed an earthquake that was 7.5 degrees away.
Despite the threat of tsunamis yesterday, people were still involved in their activities on the beach and were not leaving immediately, and they became victims of Purk Nigro Nugroho, speaking from state defense agency (BNB) shared in a writing at Jakarta.
- The tsunami didn't agree, it pulled along cars, wood, houses, sweeps all over the land, said Mr. Nugroho, and added that the tsunami went through the open sea at a speed of 800 miles (7 km/ hours) before it hit the coast.
Some climb up a tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The photographs from above are published by the disaster agency and stores that are destroyed, broken bridges, and a mosque in the water.
The trauma continues to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes has been seen in an area with 2,4 million people.
Indonesia’s Tribune and Council of Indonesia (BPP) stated in the energy supply released by a powerful earthquake on Friday was about 200 times higher than the energy of the atom bomb that fell into the city of Derby during World War II.
The location of the city, at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, according to the announcement.
Brother Nugroho described the damage that the damage was: the big, large, and explained thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels that had fallen down.
The remains of some victims were found stuck under the ruins of the buildings, which he reported, were 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that it may not be possible to stop along the coast of 300 miles [90 km] north of Palu, an area called Donggala, near the heart of the earthquake.
It was completely paralyzed from Donggala, Mr. Nugroho.
There are more than 0,000 people living there, where the Red Cross says that in a declaration, the staff and volunteers are reaching out to affected areas.
This has been a tragedy, but tragedy may have become much more horror than they say.
The seventh day was widely condemned for noting that the tsunami came to Palu, although the officials indicated that the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In an unmarked video on social networks, it shows that it's possible to hear a man standing on high screaming for people under the streets of the tsunami coming near.
A few minutes later, a water wall came to the shore, sweeping along the buildings and cars.
Reuters cannot confirm the video.
The earthquake and tsunami that caused a major power loss caused a break in the region around Palu that caused the government to have difficulty bringing relief efforts.
The officials said that the Army had already begun to send planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the immigrants still needed food and other basic foods.
The city airport has been opened for relief efforts and will close it until October.
President Joko Widodo will plan to visit the evacuaters in Palu on Sunday.
There are more than 800 lives in Indonesia's Spirits.
It's very rough.
While the staff of the World Vision came from Donggala to safety, the staff were in the office building, and they went through the scene of destruction on the streets, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me that they saw a lot of houses destroyed by his words.
The situation is very bad.
Even when aid groups began to turn on significant movements when they started disaster relief tools, some were complaining that foreign aid workers were being prevented from moving to Palu.
According to Indonesia’s rule, funding, private, and foreign resources can only begin to take place if disaster is declared as a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
. This is still a wake - up disaster: Aurelia Arriani, the speaker of the Indonesia Cross.
Once the government decides, yes, it's a national disaster: we can be ready for international support but no language yet.
When the second night falls on Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of those who are still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be magic to plant the dark stories of nature.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled up from the plumbing.
On Sunday, rescue workers delivered a woman under the ruins for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandono, trained by Indonesia National Guard, trained two of the players who were missing for the Asian sports team in Indonesia.
Others were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Brother Mandagi, as his students.
As an old man in the field, I carried heavy burden of my own personal feelings.
Gendon relates, for a few hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Roa Roa spread in the community, he was desperate to send a Chinese note to his opponent at Palu, who was attending the beach festival.
His message, however, only reported a gray missing area rather than two green cases.
I think that means that text messages have not been sent. He says.
The thieves took 26,750 when ATM was loaded in Newort in Levee.
According to the news from the New Linux Police Department, the thieves took $7750 from a Brink bank bank manager when they were putting money into an ATM in Newortors in Levee.
The driver in the car cleaned the ATM tree in the recreation area and was about to give more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy gave it up in his article.
When he was busy, a man came from behind Brink, and took away his money bag.
According to the news, the witnesses saw a lot of suspects around the scene, but the police had not identified yet the subject of the crime.
Anyone who has information on the identity of the suspect involved is happy to link the Newport Police Police Department to 859-380.
Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
You wrote in the paper about the change on Twitter on Saturday: before everyone knew about me, I'm Konye West.
West, 41 years old, named Ye for a while and used this name as the eighth album was published in June.
The change took place before you showed up on Night Night Night, when you were expected to release a new album Yandhi.
He was a guest who invited the program for Ariana Grande when she said that he was emotional. .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Just as writing in his present name, West once said this word has religious significance for him.
I believe that it was the most common word in the Bible and in it that means that you are now sharing in the first year, while talking about your own album with the Big Boy speaker.
So I'm friends, I'm us, it's us.
The transition from Kanye, which means the only thing, is Ye -- the reflection of good, the evil, the back, everything.
Album is more than our own reflection.
You're one of the famousppers who traded names.
Sean Baggins is well known by the name Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he said he was targeting Love and Brother Love.
An artist once worked with West, JAY-Z, who was wondering if there was any sign of the line and who wrote the flowers.

The United States should double support A.I.
When China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount of money in this area, investors and careers on AI Kai-Fu Lee, who used to work for Google, Microsoft and Apple share.
The ideas were made after the various parts of the U.S. government have issued a press on AI, even though the entire U.S. is in need of formal strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced her plan last year: the target to become a nation leading to AI innovation to 2030.
: Double the AI budget would be a positive start, because all other countries are very far behind the United States, and we're looking for the next break in AI - Lee to say.
Two times the cost of cost can be twice the chance that the next huge AI will be done in the United States, Lee share with CNNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, the writer of this month by Houghton Miffn Hartin, director of Sinojarures: China, the Valley of Silicon, and the New World, published in this month by Houghton Moughifflin Haritor, director of Sinojarures, has invested in one of the most prominent firm companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked at a AI system that defeated the Charlie player in America who had the highest class in America, then he was director at Microsoft Research and the Google branch director in China.
Lee approached the previous technology contests of the United States government as a challenge to the Human Agent of Human Rights Research and interested in when the next competition was going to take place, to help identify the next vision.
Researchers in the United States often work hard to obtain government aid, Lee share.
To be not China calling for all the scholars to go first; it's the symphony of Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired these bright stars from colleges to work about AI in recent years.
Lee, who shares changes in immigration policy, can also help the United States to strengthen their AI efforts.
He added: ‘ I think that green card should automatically be given doctors about AI
The Chinese hospital has launched the next generation development plan in July 2017.
Mr. Lee adds: \"The Chinese National Science of Sciences offers aid to those who are part of the same academic institutions as the United States and other governments support money for U.S. researchers, but the quality of research in China is lower.
Early this year in the U.S.A. established a U.N. Center of Creation, to intervene in partners from industrial and educational institutions, and the White House had published the creation of artificial intelligence.
It's this month's Chief of Human Rights Research Projects Research for Two billion dollars for a project called AI Next.
In National Science, they now invest over 100 million dollars per year on AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. laws have been looking to establish a National Security Council of Social Security, but they haven't seen any movement for months.
The people of Macedonia votes on a national demand for change of country.
The people of Macedonia were votes on Sunday to make their name known to the North Macedonia, or not, is this an act of dispute that lasted for decades with Greece to prevent the joining of Europe and the European Union.
Greece, the country had a province called Macedonia, claiming that the name of the northern neighbor’s name corresponds to its own territory and had ruled in the U.S.A.
The two governments signed a deal in June based on a new title called, but the anti-millionists claim that this change would weaken the ethnic nature of most people in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov declared that he would not vote on the demand and that a fishing campaign had developed doubts about whether an election would have at least 50% request for the legality of the civil request.
The question on the vote is to bear content: You have agreed to become a member of the UR and EU with no approval with Greek agreement.
People who support the names, including Prime Minister Zaran Zav, claim that it's a price to pursue a pursuit of organizations like EU and Macedonia, one of the countries that rise from the collapse of Persia.
Olivera Georgijevski, who is 79, is in Sjeje. I'm here to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can enjoy the support of the European Union because it's going to be safer for all of us.
Although members of the Congress were not legally bound, they said they would comply with the votes to make their decision.
Change will need two thirds of votes in Congress.
National election committee says there's no reports of unusualities until 1:00 p.m.
However, the election rate was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the election last year when 66 percent of votes were registered.

Before the Church in Sjeje, Vladimir Kavarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small platform and pulling chairs before the tent was set up by those who were going to take off the civil demand.
Kavadarkov said: \"We support Lauda and EU, but we want to be in the main path, not through the back line.\"
We're a poor country, but we're clean.
If they don't think we're Macedonia, then we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Asia bond.
Prime Minister Zaev said that as a member of the U.S. team, there would be significant investments for Macedonia, where there are more than 20 percent.
I believe most of us will agree because more than 80 percent of our citizens support EU and Joaev, after the vote.
He shared that the outcome of an agreement would be to be a claim for our future.
A poll published on Monday last week by the Macedonia Institute for Researchary Research said that about 30 to 43 percent of the votes would be involved in a rather than a vote.
Another poll, made by Telma TV by Macedonia, revealed 57 percent of the people asked for a vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said that they made an agreement.
A successful civil demand must be 50 percent and a vote.
The failure of the civil bridge showed the first serious strike with the Western government's policy since it took place in May last year.

The Bub's movement in West Virginia
The president mentioned details of the situation around his high court, choosing Bret Katnaugh when talking about the importance of vote for the Republicans in the midterms.
All we do is have potential in November
There are only five weeks left to one of the most important votes in life.
This is one of the big, big things -- no running, but there's a reason for me to go all the way around for my best - beings.
On the other hand: You're going to see the negative, negative Republicans exist right now.
And they're determined to suppress power by using any trick, and you'll see selfishness, tricks.
They don't care who's hurt, they have to step on who to get power and control, they just want to have power and control, and we won't give it to them.
He added, the Democratic Republic wants to stop and stop.
You've seen it for the past four days; he adds and says that the Democratic Party is angry and selfish and deceptive.
He pointed out that the Senate Committee recognized Senator Dianne Feinstein, this has been stumbling from below.
Remember her answer?
Did you let the information out?
What?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The Laos are no longer an open party.
It's impossible to say that the opinion is unacceptable.
I'm not surprised that the Baudelaires were active, in my local party votes to check me.
Finally, I'm the latest of a series of Laos who were informed that I wasn't welcome - for expressing my opinion.
As members of my community, Joan Ryan also received similar treatment because she was determined to support it.
In my case, the behavior of behavior is dependent on me because it doesn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
As to the importance of a reasonable economic policy, national security, in Europe, similar issues that Mr. Jeremy did not agree with earlier leaders.
informing the Lao Party of Turbo East on Friday declared that we want our meetings to be specific and effective.
For almost eight years as a senator for the local Lao Party, the Friday leadership meetings are like that.
Sadly, today, it is not the tone of many political meetings and political promises, more gentle, more mild - minded, forgotten, and really that it was ever started.
More and more clearly see that different views don't get rid of anything in the Lao Party and all ideas are being measured on whether the heads of the party are acceptable.
This began as soon as Jeremy became leader, because my former associates thought that my political views had begun to expect me to change my mind and take the positions that I would never approve of national security or the EU market.
Whenever I speak openly -- and actually, despite what I say -- to take the abuse of social media calling out, to tell me that I shouldn't be in the Lao Party.
And that's not just what I saw.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because comments point to me as political trends.
I was surprised by the professional nature and determination of my colleagues, who faced the current with sexual abuse or racial differences every day, but never failed.
One of the sadest aspects of this age of politics is that abuse has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Lao party should embrace the humble culture.
In fact, we're no longer that extended party and with all sorts of attitudes, without self - confidence, or the change of choice, the party has become narrow down.
I've had a lot of advice for the past two years about urge me to remain calm, don't be too many words and then I'll stop.
But I'm not in politics for that.
Since I joined the Lao Party 32 years ago when I was a boy, I was inspired by the spread of the government Thatcher, which caused my entire school to collapse literally, I've been trying to bring better service to people who need them -- whether they're local or government officials.
I've never hidden my political views, even in the past election.
No one in Kremlin East can be seen wrong about your policy and my differences with the current leadership.
For those who moved on Friday, all I wanted to share was that when my country was in Brexi, it would hurt our families, our business, our public service, and our public service, I didn't want to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the Governing Body.
But actually, a message outside of Cyrilttum that I watch my wings, to my votes, whether it's members of the Lao Party or not: I'm proud to serve, and I promise that there's no threat to get rid of or any political threat to me to act for what I believe is the greatest benefit for her.

But Melrose has already begun to gather two conveniently and Patrick Viewed a project, Baggot put more points, draws the scale down to five points.
After a long time of severe injury for Ruarh Kid, who was left behind, and since he was renovating, Ayr led beyond Stafford McDowall, Climo added points.
Captain Ayr, Robert Macpherson, then got a gold card, and again, Melrose made the best player on a desk that didn't score Bruce Colvine's side bearing, before a stress pressure.
Yet, the host returned, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a golden card against Climo without the ball, from the temple route, MacPherson made a point on Ayr's support.
Climo added the points, as he did almost after he returned, after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's shadow and sent him to Gregor Henry's wingman behind the fifth grade of his host.

‘ The sea is ours. The country is not in Bolivia, hoping that the court will open its way to the Pacific.
The crew patroled a Navy headquarters equipped in La Paz.
Public buildings hang the green flag.
The Navy bases from Lake Ticca to Amazon are also painted with a title: Our right.
The sea is our mission again.
Every corner of Bolivia, the memory of a coast that was lost into Chile in a blood conflict in the 19th century was still alive - and the desire to sail into the Pacific again.
Those hopes were probably the burningest of decades, since Bolivia was waiting for the decision of international justice on October 1, after the year considered.
Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian foreigner, shared in his positive, positive spirit of unity and calmness, and of course, in a positive view of the result.
Many people in Bolivia will follow ICJ's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in the Hague will support Bolivia's statement, that after decades of intense exchanges, which is the obligation to negotiate Bolivia to a customs sea.
Evo Morales, the principal president of Bolivia, who faced a severe argument to re-run the next year - there were also many articles in the decision on Monday.
By the end of August, he was determined: We are about to return to the Pacific Sea
But some analysts claim that the court is not capable of deciding to support Bolivia - and that this is less likely to change.
The U.S. headquarters of the Netherlands has no right to grant Chile territory and has determined that they will not determine the results of potential exchanges.
ICJ's decision was made just six months after the final debate was presented, not complicated.
And further than Bolivia's court, it's been four years since it's been turned back.
Zárate says: “The subject of approach to the sea was attacked by the present Bolivian government
She adds, the campaigns of Morales have shut down the rest of Chile.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to discuss, but it will be extremely difficult to organize discussions after this.
Two countries haven't been traded the ambassador since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodrízézé, representing Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the opinion that court decision was unusually unusual.
Secondly, it will bring Bolivia’s extraordinary opportunity to open up a new era of relationships with Chile, and an opportunity to end with 139 years of unsurpassioned independence.
Calzadilla also admits that Morales - still is one of the most famous presidents in Latin America, using sealine problems as a political life-free.
Bolivia adds: “Polivia will never abandon the right to approach the Pacific
The judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to walk past
North Korea says there's never gonna be an attack on nuclear weapons unless they can trust the United States.
South Korea Secretary Ring Ho revealed that his country would never bring an end to nuclear weapons unless they could trust Washington before.
Mr. Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations Council.
He urged the United States to make promises at the top convention in Singapore among the leaders of both sides.
He noted that the American Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be on his way to re-start the nuclear foreign policy for more than three months after his meeting in Singapore with the North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un.
R. Ri said it was a dream of continued punishments and opposition from the United States to the end of the North War to cause the North War to fall.
Washington is carefully agreeing with the statement that doesn't have PARENTs to carry out the proper action to remove the first weapon.
Both Kim and President of the United States, Donald Cheap, wanted a double meeting.
But there's no small doubt that PlS is very serious in abandoning a armory that this nation can consider as the only way to secure.
Mr. Pompo is planning the next month's visit to prepare for the second Kim-Tump.
The Paris Page releases the latest product line of large helmets that are about to cover waves across large streets near you.
If you want to open up your hat or completely avoid the sun, you don't have to look far away.
The designer of Chemo and Thom Browne revealed a series of different major designs in their SS1 volumes on the ice collection that would spread design at Paris’s Day.
No high-end application hats did scan Instagram this summer and those designers brought their eyes to the floor.
The outstanding piece of chocolate is a yellow hat that is so large that is attached to weapons-like vessels, covered on the head of the model.
The vessels of too much suffering include chalks, wizards, and even a limp - but they're not designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also reveals a series of weird masks that can make time for Halloween.
A lot of squirt masks are squirted in a more similar way than advanced fashions.
Another design is like a sea-festing device that is complete with breath and glass, and another device looks like an ice cream that melts.
And if you continue to catch up in a giant fashion, you're lucky.
The ancient grave predicts that the big stymats may be about to cloud waves across large streets near you.
The big caps became hot on the heels \"La Bomba', the wide hat was used by Rihanna to Emily Ratakski.
The admirer behind the extremely uninhabited hat was spread throughout social media that brought another major creativity to the floor - a large beach bag that was almost a bath suit.
The orange raffia bag that was burned, was bound with gulfia with white - white skin hands, which was outstanding in La Riviera SS1 of Jacquemus at Paris’s fashion week.
The well - known model Luke Armitage shared with FE Your Life: ‘ I expected to see the hats and large sea bags that filled the streets at the next summer - because designers have made such a huge impact that it could be difficult to ignore the needs of large vessels.
John Edward: foreign skills are essential for global citizens.
Private schools in Scotland continue to maintain their brilliant learning level, which was continued in '43, with a series of highly educated learning results, strengthened by both individuals and groups in sports, art, music, and community activities.
With over 3,000 students all over Scotland, these schools were supported by the Swiss Board of Education (SCIS), trying to bring the best function of service to students and parents.
So independent schools tend to be filled with deep and extensive knowledge, as well as the direction of your students and standing as global citizens.
As a educational distribution that can design and run a special school teaching program, we see modern languages that continue to be a popular and chosen subject in schools.
Nelson Nelsona once said: \"If you talk to someone in his language, what he knows is going to go into his mind.
If you talk to him in his own language, the things that say are going to go into his heart.
It is a powerful message that we are not only based on English but also on our desire to establish a relationship and trust with people who come from other countries.
From recent exams, we can see that foreign languages are taking the lead in edits with the number of points in private schools.
total of 68 percent of foreigners students are better than A.
The data collected from 74 members of RVS showed 72 percent of students who had more students than A in Chinese, besides, 72 percent learned German, 69 percent learned French and 63 percent learned Spanish.
This shows that the main schools in Scotland are following the path of reference to language are the essential skills that children and young people will not be able to have in the future.
The foreign language lessons are being viewed as STEM (theology, technology, and mathematics) in private schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the British Council of Work and Nerves in 2014 showed that in the very difficult reasons for their efforts to find people, there is a lack of foreign skills.
As a result, foreign skills became more practical to equip young people to enter their careers in the future.
With the more opportunities of career, these skills become practical in an ever - increasing world.
No matter how people choose jobs, if they learn a second language, they get a real advantage in the future when there's a full-time skill.
It is possible to communicate directly in the language of the natives, and it is obvious that a popular speaker takes the lead in every trial.
According to one survey by YouGlov over 40,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75 percent of them couldn't practice a simple part in another foreign language, and only French is the only language that has the ratio of a number of units, 15 percent.
That's why it's important for children to invest in language today.
In many languages, especially the languages of the developing economy, will be equipped with better potential for finding a real job.
In Scotland, every school teaches different languages.
Some schools will focus on more modern languages, while others will teach foreign languages as important to Britain in view of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interest they enjoy, they have a variety of languages to choose from within private schools, along with their team of professional teachers.
Private schools in Scotland focus on a prepared, prepared environment for young people who are essential for success, no matter what the future may be.
Can't deny that, in an international economy, the language will continue to be a major factor in the future of the nation, which should be extended in education.
In fact, modern languages should be viewed as an international communication skills.
Private schools will continue to present this opportunity to the men of Scotland: diversity and beauty.
There is no other option.

LeBron in the first battle at Lakers in the last Sunday in San Diego.
The wait was about to come to the end for fans who wanted to see LeBron James play his first fight for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers Luke Walton's coach informed him that James would play in the season-in-the-joy game with helpers on Sundays in San Diego.
But you'll be in the fight for as long as you're not determined.
Mr. Walton shared on the official website of Lakers:
The reporter of Lakers, Mike Trudell, shared that James was going to be in battle during a limited time.
At the end of the week's practice, James was asked about plans for six season-in-a-a-row games in Lakers.

Z's campaign in West Virginia, Lecter YouTube.
Tonight, at Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Kendorp began campaign campaigning.
This is the first stop to stop on the five campaigns of Zank, which includes stopping in countries like Tennessee and Mississippi.
The proper vote was for the candidate that he introduced to the empty position of the Supreme Court in delay, the President of Cambodia was trying to fight before the midterms, when the Republicans were at risk of losing control of the Congress when the vote started in November.
The West Virginia movement starts at what hours tonight, and how can you watch online?
We were in Wheeling City, West Virginia expected at 7 p.m. tonight at Saturday, Saturday, March 29,2018.
You can track Z.S. in West Virginia directly online on YouTube.
President Hardyp may refer to the hearing this week of Bret Katnaugh's week to conduct a week with the Supreme Court judge.
However, the primary purpose of these campaigns was to fight against the support of the Republican candidate before the election in November.
Hence, according to Reuters, the target of campaign through 05 campaigns for the next week was to give volunteers and Republicans the Republicans to protect and expand the majority of the votes they hold in the Senate and the House.
Now, Congress is a major issue in the program, so the president will visit the most states before he enters the busy election of the campaign. A movement official who wants to be revealed to Reuters.
The project took place at Wlackco University, Wheeling City, where tonight we can attract people fromOhio and Pennsylvania, also attracting the Scriptures to the radio of West Virginia News.
This Saturday will be the second visit by TT, the last month to West Virginia, the state he won his 40% away in 2016.
We're trying to support Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for West Virginia, because he's now behind the polls.
According to Reuters, Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University: The President has to visit the state for support in a vote for candidate is not a good sign for Morrisey.
KATILL Ryder: The American team demonstrated the determination to fight in single games on Sundays.
After three unsatisfied games, a couple fight on Saturday afternoons could be necessary for Renata Ryder.
It's a whole new game concept, but it's also the movement that the athlete really believes, especially in games like this.
So where is the current motive?
They took the lead before six points, flying only 4, and I think it's the motive for us to give it to us.
Of course, the European team has the advantage, led by four points, and they have 12 more games.
As Tophth says, the U.S. team still had a little hope and they were very encouraging, especially with the cyclone and Justin Thomas Thomas, and these recruits have been fighting a lot of times and each spent three points.
Roth is the old golfer in the position of balls to the golf hole and you always take the lead as an example.
The shoutings were getting stronger when they came to his game, especially the trick to win the fight when he and Thomas struck the ball in the golf hole.
That's the same thing about winning the 15th fight, which means you're fully confident in the reverse of the American team.
Troth says: \"You must think very carefully and worry about your own game
All athletes have left.
There's 18 holes left to score.
In the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, a myth that is impossible to deny the Ryder, is the only pair of couples who can get higher than Romath and Thomas.
This strange but remarkable couple of European recruits once won 4:0 and could not make mistakes.
:Molwood, the only couple won't beat up on Saturday afternoon, but also avoid bgegey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and nine holes later on Friday morning.
The victory and the energy from them spread to the glacines that made people feel that they were the enemy who needed to defeat on Sunday; and no other player deserves more than Flemetwood or Molinari to protect the European team at the fall of Leng National Park.
I hope you both appear together in different golf holes.
Still, it's too early to confirm the victory of the European team.
Melanie Watson and Webboni had defeated Michael Garcia, the hero of the fourball match in the morning, in battle with Alex Noren.
A bgegey and two gallons in the first nine holes caused the Spanish and Sweden to lose their full chance of reacting.
On Sunday, I'm afraid no one can pull them out of that failure.
The fourballs and foursomes were also worth the most because interaction between the pairs, their advice, and watching the strategy change only in principle.
The European team fought better together and led far before the final competition, but this foursome team showed that the American team still had a chance to win.
The European team led 10-6 before starting the final competition of Turbo Ryder.
The European team will take advantage of the advantage of the last day Vandal Ryder's last contest after the fourball and foursome show, leading to the U.S. team. 10-6.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led this advantage with two Tiger Woods to take four points on Lelf National.
Thomas helped the European team, with determined to win the game back to the team to lose your team at Hazeltine two years ago, won the American island in the morning, led by 3-1.
The U.S. team is better at the foursome match, winning two games, but cannot win the final victory.
Jim Bidok's team needs eight points in the menu competition on Sunday to get back to the match.
Fleetwood was the first European baseman who won four points when he and Molinari, is commonly called the double-pound couple, who were the second couple after the dramatic weekends that had won four points in the open series of Ryder's history.
After ruling down Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they had a more convincing victory before Woods and all U.S. Bryson Dechambeu at 5214.
Woods fought two games on Saturdays and sometimes there were moments of light, but to this day, he lost 19/29 in a series of foursomes and foursomes, in which there were seven of them coming in.
Justin Rose, after resting in the morning fourball match, came back in the foursome game, defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, two players in line 1 and 3 in the world, with 2-1-1.
However, although the West Paris weather was very pleasant, the European team did not have an easy day of competition.
The Unsub who won three huge victorys of Jordan Roth and Justin Thomas laid a major stake for the American team with two points on Saturday.
They won 2&1 before the Spanish baseman Jon Rahm and Ian Pourball in the fourball fight, and then they continued to defeat Poucher and Rory Mclroy with four squared in foursome, even though they missed the first two.
In the history of Vandal Ryder, only two times a team was led to four points that could begin the single game, though, the Trok team would just hold the peace.
After only two days as the second stander, Sunday is likely to be the back line for this team.
North Korea claims 'No' to win the unique armor without faith.
North Korea speaks to the United Nations on Saturday, claiming that punishment commands are still being kept growing deeper and more suspiciously with the U.S. and in this situation, there is no way that this country is giving up nuclear weapons.
Rung Ho spoke during the annual meeting of the United Nations Council, stating that North Korea has carried out many fine-departing measures over the past year, such as nuclear testing and rockets, took out nuclear facilities and commitments to promote nuclear and nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
We don't see the same behavior from the U.S. side of the U.S.
If we can't count on the U.S. side, we won't be able to secure national security, and in this situation, we'll never be able to solve ourselves in the first place.
Although R. Ri still repeated the Korean familiar objection to Washington’s rejection of nuclear weapons, in every period of time, and Korea would have enjoyed a similar benefit when he made that statement, his statement was to have a significant point that he refused to refuse the application of protection from nuclear weapons as long as he had refused to.
Ri referred to a general declaration made by Kim Jong Un and Mr. Donald Chemp gave up at the first largest convention between an American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 6. In this statement, Kim made a commitment to the U.S. weapons of nuclear weapons on North Korea, while he promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea is still trying to find official ways to end Korean war in 1950, but the U.S. insisted that PlS has to give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington also objected to appeal to dissipate international punishments to the Elvis.
( b) Intributing the first nuclear weapon, and increasing the force of punishment to achieve its objectives, even against Dad’s opposition to the end of the war, Mr. R.
(Man) The point is that punishment can cause us to kneel down to our knees is just the wild dream of those who don’t understand us.
But the problem is that the punishments are still maintaining this continued to lose our trust.
Mr. Ri didn't mention the plan to hold the second highest convention between President Kim and President Khab, as the American leader presented at the first week of the United Nations.
Instead, this foreign leader refers to three encounters between President Kim and President Moon Jae-in over the last year and adding: If the U.S. nuclear negotiations were Korea, not the U.S.A., then the Korean nuclear negotiation wouldn't fall in the same way today.
Yet, Ri’s tone was different from last year, when he said before the council that North Korean launch was impossible to escape in a fatal mission after the Crowd called Kim the missile.
Last year in the United Nations, Mr. Riker threatened to destroy the North Korean, but this year's whole year's praise was made bravely for taking steps to break the armor, but he also emphasized that there's much more to do in need of work and punishments were to be kept until North Korea's attack.
On Wednesday, TT, he said that he did not set aside time for this: about three years, three years, or just five months.
China and Russia claim that the United Nations Security Council should be rewarded for their efforts.
However, the Secretary of State Mike Potee on Thursday said before the UN Security Council: “The punishments of the Security Council must continue to be strong and unsatisfied until we can confirm the results, eventually, with proof.
The Security Council has agreed to increase the punishments of Korea since 2006 to stop the financial fund for nuclear missiles and nuclear weapons.
Secretary Pompeo has been invigorator Ri for the official meeting of the United Nations Council and has told us that he will visit PingCON again in the next month to prepare for the second convention.
Mr. Pompeo has visited Korea three times this year, but the outcome is not quite possible.
He left Korea after his visit in July and said that the negotiation had made certain progresss, but just a few hours later, North Korea accused the foreign leader of making such requests as black society.
North Korea pledged to meet President Moon Jae-In this month to take off a rocket trial base and a nuclear complex if America had the same movement.
He told the president of Kim’s instruction that he was looking for the security he had committed in Singapore and moving to normalize relationship with Washington.
Harvard's student is in full rest.
In an effort to resist the culture of mechanical pressure, with 'The Night' drink of coffee, a new course at Harvard University this year has encouraged all college students to sleep much more than their college students.
Researchers at the University of University are often unaware of their basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard University, also was an expert at Women's Hospital and Brigham who designed this course, and he himself believed that this was the first class in America.
The excitement began this course after he attended a talk about the impact of lack of sleep for learning.
'After the end of the talk, a student came to me and said, 'Why did you know this?'
She said that no one told her about the importance of sleep, which really surprised me, he shared with The Telegraph.
The course has been introduced for the first time this year, explaining to students how important their sleep habits helps to enhance their learning results and sports, and how they improve their common health.
Paul Barrira, professor of psychology at Harvard University of Harvard University, conducted medical services in college, revealed that the school decided to introduce this course after finding out that students had no serious sleep during the week.
The course lasted a long period of time, which includes a series of interactive tasks.
In part of a signic picture, in which students can pour into a cup of coffee, a door, exercise, and a study of the effect of caffeine, the light, and the lack of sleep on the results of exercise, as well as the importance of the process of having a proper sleep.
In another part, those involved who are learning how long sleep may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Later, the university map, with interactive symbols, encouraged the participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know this course cannot immediately change students' behavior.
But we believe that you have the right to know -- like you have the right to know how to affect your health when you choose to smoke, Professor Czeisler adds.
He said: “The culture is proud of the night. The storm is still there, and modern technologies and pressures are increasing toward students who are causing less sleep problems.
Make sure that enough sleep, the quality of good sleep should become 's secret gas' for students to fight stress, depression, and anxiety - even to avoid weights, because lack of sleep causes the brain to fall into hunger, which leads to continue hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California who was studying biology, chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design this course, and at the same time he joined one of his first year's classrooms in Harvard.
He said that the course helped him to ‘ stay in his sight and to inspire him to try to hold a course in the entire school.
He hoped that the next step would be recommending all post-U students to join a similar program before they start competition in the main course.
Professor Czeisler encouraged students to consider when they set up a wake-up alarm, now getting up, and then they need to realize the impact of ' green light' comes from an electronic screen and the LED, which can cause your biological disorder, which can lead to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 McGads: Menga beat down Gerrard's boys.
Wolves had a successful day when Dolly Menga's attack led Steven Gerrard's team to fail with a percentage of 1,0 before Livingston.
The Head of Ibrox expects to mark the first victory from 4-1 at St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Alden's team has caused the second loss of Gerrard in 18 to the chief of training, pulling about eight points far away from the leader of LaBorkesier Premier Heparts.
Menga maintained seven minutes before the end of the 1st, but the atmosphere seemed never before crushed.
Massis is now falling down to sixth position while Livingston climbs on Tuesday, and only after Hibernian's about the winning table.
And Griffs also had to deal with another problem after taking care of Calum Spence's wounds after a clear object was thrown from the head of the guest yard.
Gerrard has changed the last eight times in contrast with the team that passed Ayr to the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Olympus was at peace with Livi 11 and took a spot before the Hearts team last week, and he must have been very happy with the way his students fought their opponent during each attack.
Although Grads held more football, Livingston was a team that was truly dangerous when there was a shadow.
They should have scored a table for two minutes after Menga first threw Scott Whistman into the yard, attacked the frame of Allan McGregor but lost this opportunity.
A deep fall from Keaghan Jacobs took the ball to the captain of Craig Halkett, but behind Alan Lithgow could only lead the ball behind the frame.
Grads took control of the field, but their games were primarily based on hope rather than faith, especially during the final period of the battle.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he had to enjoy the punishment on the bar for you and Steven Lawless happened to touch but the honour of Steven Thomson rejected this Colombian player's appeal.
Walcs only hit the wall twice in the first round, but former Ibrox Kelly Kelly didn't have any difficulty with Lassana Coulbaly's head and Ovire Eculia's attack.
Although Livi's opening a billion into the 34th minute was considered an advantage, no one could deny that their victory was entirely worth it.
Once again, Adams couldn't handle Jacobs' trails.
Scott Arfield didn't have time to react when Declan filed the ball for Scott & Scott. And Scott was calmly choosing Menga to finish the simple end.
Gerrard immediately had the task for his vacation, by changing Coulbaly by Ryan Kent, and the removal of this person almost immediately brought the trigger when the player started making a ball for Morelos, but Kelly was impressed by immediately stopping the ball.
But Livingston has succeeded in dragging his guests to play the same game they wanted, when Lithgow and Halket are constantly running out long lines.
Whistler's team had a chance to rise up in the last minute of the game, but regret that McGoror chose the right position to stop Jacobs before Lithgow hit him from the corner.
Our new player into the Example Middleton yard continued to complain about the treatment after the attack on Jacobs, but again he was rejected by Thomson's genius.

HlV/ Aids: China reports 14 percent of infected people.
China has just published the number of citizens of this country living with HlV and Aids has increased 14%.
Medical officials report that there are over 80,000 people who suffer from this disease.
In the second and third year, the number of infections is identified as 400,000.
The majority of new infections are sexual infections, which are a major change in the past.
Before, HlV spread rapidly in some areas of China that were blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected HlV by this road has dropped almost as much as zero. This is the speech of Chinese health officials at a convention in South Korea.
However, the number of people who live together with HlV and Aids in China each year has increased 100,000 people.
HlV infection through sex is a serious problem that's happening in the LGBT community in China.
Although homosexuality has no longer been considered illegal in China since 1997, in fact, behavioral behavior in dealing with the LGBT community is still common.
Because of the traditional values of this country, it is estimated that 70-90 percent of men are finally married, even though they have produced sexual relations with men.
Many have been infected with a century - old disease that has not been used enough to protect themselves when sexual relations is involved.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed an agreement to cure HlV for all patients in order to cope with this disease.
Mrs. Maxine Waters denys that her employees reveal the data of the Republican Senators, stressing 'the danger' and 'Prection'
On Saturday, the U.S. Party representative Maxine Waters, denied that a member of her staff posted personal information from three Republicans on Wikipedia pages on the lawholders.
The Democratic Party in Los Angeles claims that these charges were made by intelligent experts, and the sites arranged.
; Lying, lying, and lying are even more valuable than what Waters write in a Twitter article.
According to the report, leaking information includes private address and phone number of American Senator Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, from Utah state.
These information began to appear online on Thursday, since a man who did not know the identity of a certain member of the Gestapo Hill during the Senate's hearing of sexual assaults against the candidate of the Supreme Court of Bretttval Kanaugh.
This information was revealed a short time after these three senators questioned Kavalaugh.
The Hill wrote: “The security sites such as Gaewaydit and Red Virginia believe that the IP addresses are based on the Waters' office and reveals information about one of Mrs. Waters' staff.
Waters continues to say: \"This invisible base is completely not true and absolute\"
: The staff in my office has been violated by identity, personal information, and the safety of these false accusations and false accusations that have not been revealed.
It's absolutely not true and absolute. It's a lie.
This statement by Mrs. Waters was immediately attracted to online criticism, including former Secretary of the White House, Mr. Avescher.
To deny this, my father showed his anger, Fleischer.
: This shows that she has no air in her life as members of Congress.
When someone is accused of a behavior that is not what they do, people shouldn't be angry.
They're not tempted.
They were not asked about the motive of the person who offered the charges.
They had to display calmness and peace.
Fleischer seems to be comparing Waters' reaction to Judge Kavalaugh's reaction to the criticisms of the Democratic Party and the critics also accused him that he was too angry in the hearing of the fifth.
Omar Navaro, a Republican candidate who is running into Waters' position in the election during the midterms, also manifests a view on Twitter.
To be true if you're really going to be big if it's true, you write on Twitter.
Waters declared that her office had warned the authorities, and the law authorities against these false accusations.
We'll make sure the criminal will be given the light, and she continues to talk about it. And they'll be responsible for all the actions that might cause harm and danger to any of my employees.
That's Johnny English Grouper -- Rowan Atkinson's funny, funny spy.
Now, it's possible to see a rather traditional trend in any new movie that has the British element of looking for the meaning of Brexi, and the next set of Johnny English spying is no exception.
Will self - defense on the subject of how useless we are to become a new export opportunity for this nation?
In any case, Agent Johnny English, which is limited to the round eyes, and the sprinked face is allowed to throw things up again - his name is simply representing a comic book designed for unspeakable territories.
Of course, he's a secret agent, though he's always playing ducks in a strange manner, in the manner of Detective Clouseau, mixed up Mr. Whistler's humor and something contributed to the theme of Fatherriots of Fire during the Olympic Church in 2012.
The reason for the character is also based on the visitors and the international mystery man Atkinson who was built in the Barclaycard TV report now drowned in his obsession and caused chaos when he woke up.
There are some pretty interesting scenes in the latest Johnny English movie.
I like the scene of Johnny English coming near the helicopter while wearing the middle-aged armor and those fangs hit his hat.
Although Atkinson's humor is fully evident, the funny element here seems to be not enough heavy and extra-near enough, especially when the movie is, like a bunch of DFO and an impossible task that makes the play just a taste.
The funny factor in this film can only make children laugh, I myself think Johnny English's stupid mistakes have nothing to be creative and interesting as the jokes in Mr. Atkin's dumb movie.
The situation that led to the story is that England is in serious trouble.
Reporters have entered the super secret agent's network, revealing the identity of all British agents working outside, leading to the mental loss of a mission agent, a very sad role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance of the prime minister, a proud and powerful character, who is now facing this political crisis.
The intelligence advisers reported that the identity of all active agents was exposed and that she would have to use an expert agent.
And he's Johnny English teaching in a country, but in fact he's teaching lessons from outside the program to become a secret agent: there's some pretty interesting jokes here, because English taught students to be a spy in the Rock Academy.
English was called back to the Emergency Court and assembled with the poor Bough former assistant, by actor Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, and I ask you, too, a female submersible woman, Georgetown, who took the role of this little waste of talent.
So, the Batman and Robin are in trouble with the Queen's orders to return to the mission and meet Olga Krylenko in the role of beautiful female Ophelia Bulletov.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into a dangerous state of content after saying he can solve all the problems of the U.S. computer problems of Jason Voltam, by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began an adventure with the impossible adventures: after they were dressed up as a waiter, they burned a French restaurant in a flash; causing chaos on Volta's boat; and English also caused more confusion when they found the use of magic to search for the true cause of Volta's search.
At the end of the movie, these knots will be removed, but such excitement is quite like the television channels for children.
It's a pretty trivial work.
And as well as other Johnny English film, I couldn't ask the question, \"You really can't give Rowan Atkinson a fair role, deserve your talent?
The Laos have rejected information building plans for the British to work for four days but received five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s labor will consider an advanced plan, allowing the British to work four days per week but received five days’s wages.
According to information received, the party wanted the business owner to transfer his savings for the artificial revolution (AI) to the workers by giving them a day's rest.
That means that the staff spends three days a day but still takes the same salary.
The sources say this idea's associated with the economic program of this party and are planning to increase support for the workers of this country.
The British Society has confirmed moving to work four days a way for workers to enjoy the benefits of the changing economy.
A high-end source in the Lao Party said to Sundays: 'Divine services will be published by the end of this year.
'This goal can't be done in short time, but working four days is a desire to be in harmony with this party's employer in reservating the economic balance is beneficial for the workers and the industrial strategy of the party.'
The Dutch Party won't be the first to approve of this idea, but the Greens are committed to work four days a day in the campaign in 2017.
This idea, however, has not yet been fully moved by the Sound Party.
One Dutch speaker said: \"In four days a book is not a party's policy and the party is not looking at this policy.\"
The dark prime minister John McDonald took advantage of the labor conference last week to increase vision for a social revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said that he was determined to win back the power from the hands of 'the unnamed governor' and 'The benefits of the services were in vain.
These plans of the Dark Prime Ministers also mean that largeholders in government companies may not have received their entire shares because the labor government can apply the 'reclaration' that's based on behavioral behavior.
He also confirmed the plan for the worker to join the company board and set up a total property policy to give 10 percent of the private companies to the company, from which they have been able to receive her every year to 500 pounds of England.
This is the first time you're going to have to do this, you're going to have to do this.
The FBI investigation of charges against Judge Brettt Katnaugh has delayed the final vote to appoint him to judge the Supreme Court in at least a week and ask the question whether the investigation of the federal intelligence could have caused any Republican senator to withdraw or not.
In an interview on Sunday, the reporter,60 Minies, Scott Pelley, asked the Republican Senator John Kennedy and available evidence that the FBI could make the senator change his mind.
Mr. Kennedy was more open - minded than his associate from South Carolina State.
I suppose of course, Mr. Kennedy said.
I said in the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavalaugh.
I called him after the incident, which is after the accused was released and asked, \"Do you do it?\"
He answered very firm, decisive, and decisively.
However, Graham’s vote seems to have been completely certain.
He said: ‘ I've decided about Brett Kavalaugh and there's only one public charge that made me change.
Professor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know something: Brettt has very strong denyd that, more than that, mentioned Christine Blasey Ford.
? And all the people she said name couldn't confirm the story.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changing.
What is the worldwide public services, and has there been any contribution to poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be held in charge of global public services, an annual event with the participation of an impressive star set to accomplish an impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
In the seventh year of this event, the global Public Day will see tens of thousands of people pour out on the Great Lecter of the Central Park not just to enjoy the performance of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and search Mendes, but to appreciate the true purpose of poverty in 2030.
The global public festival, beginning in 2012, was the expansion of the global project, an international campaign of hope to end poverty by increasing the number of active people fighting against poverty.
To receive entry into this event free of charge (if you are willing to pay for the VIP ticket), the participants must complete a series of tasks or actions, such as volunteer service, email to a world leader, telephone or any other means to improve their awareness of poverty.
But how successful has this global public festival been, when there are now only 12 years to reach its destination?
The idea of winning to see a free night for people is a practical way to convince people to call on action, or just another form of action: \"The keyboard movement\" -- people feel like they're actually making a real difference by signing a call or sending an article on Twitter?
Since 2011, the global public organization has shown that there have been more than 10 million campaigns, which have been recorded, motivates a series of different objectives.
They say that these actions have helped to motivate global leaders to make similar commitments and policy equal to more than 37 billion dollars in order to accomplish more than 2,25 billion lives’s improveability in 2030.
Early in will, the group quoted 390 commitments and announced by the team, with at least 10 billion dollars of funding or fundraising.

Some of the key commitments that include The Power of Nutriction, a community that includes investors and those who do, the child’s commitment to develops the ability to provide 25 million dollars for Rwanda to end the distress in this country after receiving more than 4700 Twitter articles from the worldwide public.
By means of support from the U.S. government, financial governments, and global citizens like you, we can turn social injustice into a state of poverty that has become a sign of the history of the gift of power, Macell, Ullman, sharing with the audience in a live show in April example.
The group also noted that after more than 5,000 acts of Kingdom action, the British empire was to improve its health for its mother and child, the government announced a project called raise - up strength, guaranteeing its intervention for five million women and children.
Answering one of the questions that often encounter on the team’s website: What makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?
The worldwide public group answers: “This will be the long and difficult course - sometimes we will fail.
But just like the civil rights and anti-human movement, we're going to succeed because together, we're going to be stronger.
Janet Jackson, theQuery Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is a group of artists who will be sharing in the performance this year in New York, by Debor-Leberness and Jackman.
America can use Navy to release Russia to produce energy - Ministerial minister
The Washington Exmineer led the Secretary of State of State Ryan Zinke to reveal: Washington can lead the Navy forces, if necessary, to prevent the Russian energy source into the market, including the Middle East market.
Zinke accused me that Russia was more interested in Syria than in following the legal government invitation - just a case of finding new energy markets.
According to the report, he said: ‘ I believe that the reason they invaded the Middle East is because they want to trade energy as in Eastern Europe, the southern valley of Europe.
And by official news, there are various ways and methods to stop this.
He said that the U.S. could use the Navy force to make sure that the transport routes were still open and will close, when necessary, to ensure their power is not entered into the market.
Zinke had called into the event by the consumer energy Union, a self-staining non-profit group known as the voice of the consumer’s energy - used consumers in America.
He continued to compare Washington with Russia and Iran to the same effect.
The economic project that Iran and Russia can choose is to use and change fuel - he says, while calling Russia, only one force - with the economy based on fossil fuel.
The claims are made when the government of TT, which is trying to increase the fuel of natural gasized into Europe, to replace Russia's location, a lot more cheap for European consumers.
In order to achieve this goal, officials of the TT government, including president of the U.S. President Donald Whistp himself was trying to get rid of the German oil supply of North Nord Stream 2 - not suitable, which led Moscow to complete control in Berlin.
Moscow repeatedly emphasized that the oil oil project in North Nord Stream 2 billion dollars, built to double the speed of pipe speed that is now up to 110 billion meters [10 billion m] block of oil, and this is a pure economic project.
The UN argues that intense opposition from Washington to this project simply comes from economic reasons and is an example of bad competition.
I believe we have a general view that energy can't be a tool to cause stress and consumers to be chosen by the Russian Minister Aleksandr Novak, who says after the meeting with the American US US Secretary Rick in Moscow in September.
The United States’s stand has brought violent reactions from Germany, and then this country has rescinded its commitment to the project.
Germany’s top industrial organization, the German industrial Union, called for U.S. not to interfere with European energy policy, as well as its parallel agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have to face a major problem when there is a third country trying to intervene in our source of energy.

Ten states and Disk of Columbia is supporting the challenge of the new U.S. policy for refugees who flee from gangs or domestic violence.

U.S. ambassador accused China's bullying' with 'coding propaganda.'
A week after a official Chinese newspaper ran a four - page commercial on a United States newspaper mentioned the general benefit of U.S. trade, U.S. ambassador in China accused North America of using American literature to spread.
Wednesday last week, the President of the U.S. President Donald Chemp mentioned an China Daily extra money for Des Moines Regist -- the best run-intering news of Iowa -- after accused China to try to intervene in the American National Congress on June 6, China, China denied this charges.
We're trying to interfere in the U.S. election on a new stage in a violent campaign against Washington, according to what the American officials share with Reuters.
Although foreign governments were promoting commercials, it's perfectly normal, Beijing and Washington are now stuck in a maestering operation, with evidence that they've put a high tax on both sides’s exports.
Chinese professionals and Americans say that China's tax policy for respiration during the early war trade was designed to enter Exporters in the state of helping to support the Republicans of TT.
Terry Branstad, the American ambassador in China, and former Governor of Iowa, exporting large foods to China, said that Beijing had hurt workers, farmers, and U.S. trades.
Branstad wrote a passage on the Des Moines Regist Sunday, saying that China continue to behave it by running our own free newspaper.
In an effort to spread, the Chinese government was using the freedom of speech and freedom of the American newspaper to put an ad on the Des Moines Register; Branstad.
And again, at the newspaper store in the streets of Beijing, you very rarely find the opposite views and won't see any genuine reflections of Chinese different ideas about the difficult economics of China, because obviously the media are completely in control of the Chinese Republic.
He added: “One of the most popular newspapers in China did keep away from the suggestion, his article, even though he did not clearly mention which newspaper was.
Investigators warned the Republicans that they were causing the women to flee from the election in the midterms of Kavalaugh.
When many parties lead the Republicans to defend their students to the Supreme Court of Brett Katnaugh before a few sexually assault charges, journalists warned them that they might have to be highly responded, especially from women, during the election in the middle of the post.
The emotion around this is quite powerful and most Republican candidates on the campaign list show that they want to continue vote.
There are things we can't do about this: Grant Reeher, a political professor at Maxwell's University of Syracuse, told The Hill in a paper published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he didn't think that Senator Jeff Flake (Bung R-Arizona) would press the FBI's consent to conduct enough investigations to calm up angry officials.
The Washington newspaper, D.C. gives Jean-Pierre, senior counselman and national speaker MoveOn Friday: women won't forget what happened yesterday -- they won't forget and they haven't forgotten by November.
Mic reported: On Friday morning, the protesters were coming to the remains of the Senate's court because the Republicans were taking control of the State Committee's vote against Kavalaugh's testimony despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blaisey Ford.
. . . . . . . . . . is going to be higher than ever before . Stu Rothenberg, a non - political analyst who shared with the news page.
They say that this motivation is now very high; yes.
But it may be even higher, especially among women on the outside and young votes, from 18 to 29 years of age, because they don't like the president.
Even before Mrs. Ford publicly stated that the sexual attack against the Supreme Court official, the experts believe that public may have a powerful reaction if the Republicans continue to confirm.
NBC News brings Michael Steele, former President of the Republic last week: It could be a mess that the Republicans had to deal with.
* It's not just the vote of the committee or the official vote, or the Kavalaugh, whether it's the Supreme Court judge or not, but it's more important than how the Republicans handle this trial and how they treat Guy, director of the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party, spoke to the speaker.
However, the American people disagreed on whether they should trust Ford or Kavalaugh, who seemed more suspicious of Kavanaugh.
A new poll published by youGov shows 41 percent of people who answer sure or who can believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say that they can be sure or possibly believe Kavalaugh.
In addition, 38 percent responded to the idea that Kavalaugh could or certainly have lied when giving testimony, while only 30 percent believed that Ford was sure or possibly lied.
After Flake pressed the contract, the FBI was working on Mrs. Ford's charges and at least one accused, Deborah Ramirre, The Guardian.
Ford swore before the Senate Committee last week that Kavalaugh attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez accused the candidate of being judge of the Supreme Court to reveal his sexual organs in front of her when they attended a party during school school in the 1980s.
World Wireless Web Maker planned to start building new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, who invented World Wide Web, is now starting a career project, to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend is called Inrupt, a construction company based on the foundation of Solid Berners-Le.
Solid allows users to choose where the data store is stored and how they can get access to it.
In a exclusive interview with Fasttechny, Berners-Lee said that the purpose behind the Inrupt project was to rule the world.
We have to start now. He said about this career project.
Now is the time of history
Solid technology, allowing users to make online data, or POD their own.
This data may include a link list, a list of work to do, a list of dates, a list of dates, a list of music library, personal and other professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, SUR and Spot, all available on a browser and display at the same time.
The unique feature of this online database is that users have the right to decide which type of information they can access.

The company now has a Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security facility that was bought by IBM, some developers have signed a contract on the project and a community of volunteers.
Starting from this week, technology developers around the world can create their own focus application using the tools available on the Input website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team weren't talking with us, Facebook and Google about changing completely or not because all their business models were able to raise after one night.
We don't need to ask them for permission
In an article on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Le wrote: the angel of Input was to provide commercial energy and a ecosystem that helped to protect the whole and quality of the new site that was built on Solid's floor.
In 1994, Berners-Le turned the Internet into the World Health Organization at Massachusetts Institute.
In recent months, Berners-Le was a powerful name in the discussion of the neutralness of the internet.
Although we've come up with the Inruput project, Berners-Le will continue to carry on the project as the founder and director of the World Health Organization, the Web Foundation and the Open Library Committee.
I'm very optimistic about the next age of the web: Berners-Leeve.
The anniversary of Dr. Bernard Vann received the Victoria Cross during World War 1
The Memorial of 100 years of the English Church was given the gift of Victoria in World War I as a warrior organized in his hometown.
Commander Reverend Bernard Vann won a medal on September 29,18 during the attack on Bellnglise and Lehauvar.
However, he died from being sniper four days later, and he never knew that he had won the highest honor of the British army.
On Saturday, his two grandsons revealed a memory stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of these two grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that this was a brilliant symbol of the stone that had been shown in the right 100 years after the war to help his grandfather win the medal.
According to the London newspaper, on September 29,18, Colonel Vann led his crew across Canal de Saint-Quret, through thick fog, under fire force from the field and machine.
Then he went straight into a bullet, and with great feeling he led the crew above, before he entered a rifle and took down three separate missiles.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on April 10,18 - just a month after the war was over.
Michael Vann, who was 72 years old, said that his father’s actions were a move that I could never do, but there was humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also had a ring after the young Royal House parade.
Michael Vann said that he felt so honored to be joined in the parade of the true hero that he was to be recognized by the support of many.
It's a martial arts fan all night to watch Bellator 216, but they only get Peppa Pig at last.
Imagine you've been up all night waiting to see Bellator 216 with a tight audience, but it was finally denied to see the main event.
The introduction to the program from San Jose said that there were 13 fights, including six games on the main card and were shown directly throughout the night in England on Channel 5.
At 6: 00 a.m., as soon as Gegard Mousasi and Rory filed up in England, the man was struck when the screen turned into Pepa Pig.
Some feel that they are not respected after they wake up in the morning to watch the game.
A fan shows Twitter that turning the program into a baby's doing something like a ridiculous joke.
They rule out that the art of martial arts at 6: 00 a.m. was inappropriate, so they had to turn into a program for children. Dave Schwartz, the senior vice president of Bellator in charge of the market and the media said that when asked about the transfer of this program.
Peppa the pig but that's right
President Bellator, Scott Coker said that they were looking at the broadcast schedule to ensure that the British audience could see the program in the future.
Mr. Coker says, I think if we do it again, we can solve the problem
: But on that side is six o'clock Sunday morning, and we can't handle the problem until Sunday is our hour, but second after their time.
But we're trying to find solutions.
Believe me, when people change programs, there's a lot of text messages back and those messages aren't very friendly.
We tried to overcome it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't finally, but it was government regulations.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We're going to cut down the number of fights down to five, instead of six games like early planned -- five is the number we used to give, and we've been trying to give out the fan level.
This is really a unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'Prua' about sex trends.
The Olympic Jumper Tom Daley shared that when he grew up, he felt like he'd lost everyone because of his sex trends -- but that's what he's doing.
24 - year - old athlete, who shared in his preaching work, realized that he wasn't like anyone, until he was in school.
Talking in Desert Island Discs for 4 by Lauren Laverne, he said that he had spoken about the rights of gay men to bring to the responsibilities of being a member of the opposite sex.
He also stated that becoming his parents made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The rice programs of this long - term program, Kirsty Young, have been resting for several months.
Among the first of Laverne’s teachings, Daley appeared as a man who was abandoned, saying that he felt weak: everyone, because his character was not accepted as a son and daughter.
He said: “To this day, to this day, the feelings of a feeling of poorness and differences are still present, becoming motivation and strength so that I can succeed.
You want to prove that you've had something -- so people don't get disappointed when you know the truth about your sex trends.
The athlete once twice won this Olympic medal has become an active movement for the LGBT community, and he uses his image to play at the World Health Organization in Australia this year to call more countries against the difference between homosexuals.
He said that he had made himself known because he felt very lucky that he could be open without being separated and brought to himself the hope of being given to others.
The three world champions shared that he loved a American man, Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 and believed to love each other.
Daley was married to a winner over this 20-year-old man, but he told me that an age difference was never an obstacle to two people.
: When you have to experience so much suffering as a child, - he joined the First Olympic Games when his father died because of cancer three years later, it would be hard to find someone with whom he had grown older in life.
The couple became Robert Ray Black-Day's parents in June and Daley said that his entire world had changed.
If you asked me last year, my goal was 'I'd have to win gold medals' for you.
- But you know, there's more to it than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic medal is Robbie
His son was named after Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father didn't accept the fact that he was dying and that one of the last things he asked them was that they had tickets in London in 2012 because he wanted to sit in front of the front seat.
I couldn't tell him that 'cha can't sit in the front row anymore' and you said.
I hold his hand when he pours out his last breath and even when he stops breathing and goes away forever, I still can't admit that he has to be uninhabitable
The following year Daley fought at the Olympics in 2012 and won the medal.
I only know that it's my whole life's dream -- dancing in front of a crowd of teachers in the Olympic Games, which is really no better than you say.
It's also a source of inspiration for him to choose his first song - Proud of Heather Small -- his accompanying song with him during his training to the Olympics and still touch him every time he hears it again.
The Desert Island Discs program was broadcast on the 4th radio at 11:15 p.m., Sunday.
Mickelson is short on his chair with Ryder's Ryder on Saturday.
The American guy Phil Mickelson would set up his record on Sunday when he played the Ryder Ryder's 47th battle, but he would have to raise his position to avoid this record as a sad experience.
Mickelson played on this two-year-old event once but Captain Jim Carverk left him on his seat in the fourball match and foursome Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action like in the U.S., the winners of this victory had to spend the entire day as an employee and play games with hoping to get out of control.
The 48st-year-old man at school was that the levers on the flat surface were never the ideal option for Le Golf National Valley Park, even when he was at the top of the height, because the error strike was going to have severe consequences.
And if this golf field isn't enough to get into trouble, Mickelson has got to fight on the 9th day of the Sunday with his opponent as the British champion of Britain, which is open to Francesco Molinari, this week, Molinari's meeting with the army of Tommy Fleetwood and won all four wars.
If the U.S. team is losing four points before starting 12 rounds that want to start in a dramatic way, Mickelson's fight is critical.
Fury expressed confidence in his men and didn't talk too much.
He knows very well his role today, he slaps my back, rolls my hand and says he'll be ready for tomorrow.
He's very confident.
He's a legend and has contributed a lot to the team, in the past and in the past week.
I could never imagine he was playing two games.
I imagine more, but that's how things happen and we think that's the right way.
He wants to fight, like all the other team.
This Sunday, Mickelson is going to cross Nick Faldo's record, becoming the most fighter in Khal Ryder.
It could also be the end of his career at Riker Ryder because the peaks of your personal record never showed up in this tournament.
Mickelson has 18 winnings, 20 losings and games, although Kendrick claims that his presence is invisible to the team.
He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, funny, he likes to laugh at people.
I think young golfers are happy to see him, and it's quite fun this week.
What he's dedicated is much more than a fight.
The leader of the European team in Thomas particular knows that first advantage can quickly disappear quickly.
Thomas filer, captain of Europe, experienced the experience that even though his team had led so much to enter the last single rounds of the Ryder season, it could still be very easy to reverse it in a way that it was not easy.
The Dante began to fight in 1997 at Valderrama, which was their team, under Seve Ballelsteros’s leadership in the year before the American team was led, but only won a few hours of seven to win.
You've always had to remind yourself that we've been leading a lot before Valderrama; we've led a lot before us in Brookline and we lost, in Valderrama, but we've won, but we're very close to our faces, and we're looking at the GDR game with five3-6 on Friday, and we're going to take it over the Lenan.
So history will show me and everyone in the team that it's not over.
You still have to focus on tomorrow.
It's good to go to the field and fight.
The tournament does not end when the zero yet on the board.
We have the goal of taking up this year, and that's our focus.
I've always said that I've been focusing on my 12 golfers, but we also understand your strengths - they're the best golfers in the world.
Happily about their display of golfes on the golf floor, have add: ‘ I'll never tell you anything.
Tomorrow will be another war.
Tomorrow is the presence of each person and it will definitely be very different.
It would be great if you fought the case and things were going well, but when you fight on your own, all the possibilities of a golf player will be revealed.
That's the message you have to share with all golfers, that they have to be ready for the best competition tomorrow.
Now, a couple must separate themselves, and each one must be ready for the best.
On the contrary, the captain of his opponent, Jim Carverk expected his men to be better able to display his own ability to do better than to play with the couple, except for Jordan Roth and Justin Thomas for three points of points.
Vindok himself had been through both directions on the last day, was a winner at Brookline before his defeat while the European team was pronounced the magic in Medinah.
I remember every word he said when asked about Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the team in 1999, gathered and encouraged the players before the final competition.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you're going to want to start as quickly as you see in Brookline, or as you see in Medinah.
When the outcome is on a trend, the games in the middle are going to suffer a lot of pressure.
We built a team in that way and sent golf to the field by the strategy and tried to make wonder tomorrow.
Thomas was assigned to lead the team to the competition and face Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Pilter, other European players in the first series.
I choose this group, in that order because I believe it's a way to get past it.
Germany's new battleship continues to be delayed to use
Local media reports: The latest German Navy ships could have run in 2014 to replace the old warship of war, but at least years later, they could run for the system and increase.
The Die Zeit has led the military spokesman: The Rhe-Palz, the leader of the ship of a completely new Benden-Wutermberg, which is now delayed until the early 20th century.
This ship was supposed to have been assigned to the Navy in 2014, but its problems had prevented this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wutertemberg ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen.
So, that means that these ships will be equipped with a strong gun, a series of air missiles, some of the invisible technology, such as the radar, the rose and the sound.
Other important features include longer maintenance -- which can be developed by the latest docks in the country's harbors for two years.
However, constantly delay means that these modern battleships would be expected to help Germany control the foreigners -- would be lost at the start of the time, in the Die Zeit.
The F125 seaship became the reporter last year when the German Navy refused to test the ship and return it to the R.H.E. Labs & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the ship factory after the delivery.
There are very little information about why this ship back was back, but the German media mentioned: software error and hardware, seriously, led to a battle ship to be completely useless if they were engaged in combat.
False software is particularly serious because the Baden-Wutertermberg ship is due to a 120-man crew - only half of the forces on the old Bremen Sea Line.
At the same time, it can be seen that the weight of the ship’s weight has increased, which leads to reduce efficiency and limits the speed of the ship’s future.
The ship,Rhef-Palz, is thought to be twice as much as the battleship of Germans used during World War II.
Besides the hardware, the cost of the entire project -- including crew training -- is also a serious problem.
The project was thought to have been made significant to number 4.1 billion (U.S.) -- while the initial estimate was 2.2,2 billion.
The problem with the latest docking of the axis became especially important in the recent scene, and there have been warnings about the power of the German Navy that is getting narrower.
Early this year, Hans- Peter Bartels, president of the German National Committee of Congress, acknowledged that the Navy was really capable of combating.
The official said that the problem became increasingly severe in time, because the old ship stopped working but no ship was replaced.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wutermberg were qualified to join the Navy.
National Info Center listens to the secret life of bats.
A new study is being conducted at a highland in Scotland to reveal how bats use natural landscapes to hunt food.
Hope these findings will shed light on the behavior of this unique flying animal and direction for future preserved activities.
This study was published by scientists at National Info Center for Scotland, following the course of popular bats, bats, bats, bats, and brown bats at the Invewe University of Ross.
The special sound player will be placed in important places around the site to monitor the operation of these bats during the year.
The NIS and volunteers will also proceed with cell phones on hand-to-pelling devices.
audio analysts will proceed to analyze all of the recording and determine the sound frequency of the bats and the sound of every single bat.
Then map and report the living environment of bats will be designed to have a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, the natural guardian of NTS, is hoping to help determine what areas of life have the most important role in bats and how each species lives in that environment.
This information will help to determine the benefits of life’s environment, such as growing grass and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
The bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have been greatly reduced in the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect bats and lose their environment.
Put the wind and the light system, the flies, some chemical measures for construction materials, as well as the cat's attacks, can cause risk for bats.
Bats aren't completely blind.
However, by the habit of hunting at night, the ears are far more useful than the eyes of a stalk and a prey.
They're using a very sophisticated echoed technology to determine how obstacles are on the plane.
NTS is responsible for over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 70,000 lands in the country, especially the bats.
There are ten experts who are trained regularly perform searchs, check and sometimes share animal rescues.
This organization even established the first and only Scollar region of Scotland in Dumfries and Tuco, which is where the lives of eight of the ten bats of Scotland.
Chief of land, David Thompson said that the land was their ideal territory.
He said that living conditions are great for bats.
We have many old buildings, many great trees and good environment.
But there's still a lot of mystery about bats, so the work here and in other facilities will help us to better understand what bats need to grow.
He emphasized the importance of having to examine the life of bats before he preserved in the lands, because his incompetent destruction could kill 400 children and sheep, almost total destruction.
Batman is a species of protection and murder, trouble, trouble, or destruction of their beans is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scylla Scythians, encouraged the community to help.
She said: \"We still need to learn more about bats and other species, how far apart they are.\"
Ronaldo rejected rape charges and his lawyer prepared for Germany's magazines.
Cristano Ronaldo says that sexual charges against him are false; and there's someone who wants to profit in his age.
Your lawyer was about to sue the German newspaper Der Schegel for fileing this charges.
The Portuguese religion that's playing for the Juventus team has been accused of rape an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
The Der Schegel reported on Friday: the player was said to have paid this woman 375,000 for keeping the job quiet.
In a live video on Instagram before 142 million people watched a few hours after the charge was published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, claiming that the report was fake.
No, no, no.
What they say today is all fake news -- the five-time player is the title of the yellow ball said in front of the camera.
They want to take advantage of my age to profit.
It's just normal.
They're known to me, but it's just part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is well - known - men add and smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Japan of this accusation, they call it the truth of doubt that there is no question of personal life.
Professor Christian Schchertz said this player would ask for it to pay for his regular moral damage with the severity of the violation, perhaps one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The case in charge was reported in June 2009 at a high school room in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the club, Ronaldo and Mayorga were thought to have returned to the manager's room, according to the records at the Clark Court Court of Nevada, you were accused of rape you at the hotel.
Mayorgana says that Ronaldo kneeled down after the accusation and said that he was a bad man.
There's a document claim that Ronaldo confirmed that both parties had sexual relations, but they were based on contracts.
Mayorga also said that she went to the police station and was taken back to the hospital, but then she agreed to compromise outside the court because she was getting paid, and worried about her reproach.
This 34 - year - old woman said that she was now trying to turn her back on the earlier resolution because she was continuing to be traumad by the charges.
At the moment of the accusation, Ronaldo was preparing from Manchester United, but at the end of this summer, he moved to play with the Italian giant Juve in the deal for 100 million dollars.
You'll be forever sorry for losing your driver's status.
The Secretary of Greg Clark said: “The Kingdom of England will be forever regret - if you lose the world’s leadership for the production of Brexill.
He also added that it was quite a bit of a worry that when Toyotta use the name is sharing with use with us when you leave the European Union without a deal, they'll stop producing at the Burnaton plant, close to Derby.
- We need a deal. - Mr. Clark shows.
The Japanese publishers said that late shifts on the border in case Brexit could lead to a job loss.
The Burnaston plant - where Toursis and Toyota's Toyota's Toyota - produced nearly 10,000 of them last year, which was ordered to other countries in Europe.
My point is that if you completely leave the European Union at the end of March, we'll have to stop producing at this factory.
The rest of the cars in England were also concerned about leaving EU without a border trade agreement, including Heonda, BMW and Jaguar Land Street.
For example, BMW says they're gonna shut down Mini plant in Oxford in a month after Brexit.
The main challenge for car producers is the risk of supplying the supply chain in the case of Brexill without any other agreement.
Toyota’s production chain is based on principles:just-intime, with all the applications available in the United Kingdom and the European Union at the end of every 37 minutes.
If you leave EU with no other agreement on March 293, there's a chance that there's a disruption on the border, and it's concerned that it can lead to a slow and inactive state.
Toyota said that this company could not keep its value too much a day in the Combollar factory, so they would have to stop producing.
Mr. Clark said that the Chequers plan of Prime Minister 25th for a relationship with the European Union in the future will be tested correctly to avoid checking on the border.
We need a deal, we want to have the best deal, not just make sure we're successful in the present world, but make sure we take this opportunity.
Intrigues from Toyota as well as other car producers show that we need to keep making sure of the completion of the supply
Toyota has not yet announced how long he will be producing, but as long as he is, they warn him that the greater cost will reduce the competitions of the factory and eventually the work loss of his job.
Peter Tsouvallaris worked at Burnaston for 24 years and was called the United Nations Group at the factory, telling us that his members were becoming more concerned: My experience when they lost these jobs was never again.
The government speaker claims: We have built an accurate and reliable plan for our relationship with the European Union in the future.
The White House reports that the meeting between Z.P. and Mr.stein could have been delayed.
The White House announced on Sunday: the high school meeting of TT, Donald Patsyvard Princips Rod Davisstein, may be on the other week when the struggle for the supreme judge’s high court official Brettt Katvugh is moving forward.
Witnesses from different parts of the Russian election are under the control of the special counselor Robert Alvarez's work, who's been investigating the intervention of the Russian election, linking the link between TT's assistants, and Russia and the President's ability to block justice.
Whether the D.C.E. would have been able to work independently, has raised several Washington rumors for months.
First of this month, the New York Times reported that Derekstein had discussed the listening ear to the conversation with Pisp and the ability to cut off the president through prime 25.
Witnesses of God would like to see you.
But second week ago, he went to the White House between rumors that he was about to resign.
Instead, his meeting with President Sherp - who was visiting the United Nations Assembly in New York - was scheduled on Thursday.
President Hardyp says, he did not want to fire Mr. Christinestein but the meeting was delayed to avoid the hearing of the Senate committee between Kavalaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse was a witness.
On Friday, President Steadp asked the FBI to spend a week on charges against Kavalaugh, and he kept delaying the Senate’s full vote.
President Cheap's secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked for a meeting ofstein, she said: “The date is not yet scheduled, may be this week’s reasons for this delay is because other matters are taking place at the Supreme Court.
But soon we'll get news and the press will be updated.
Some reporters may disagree with that statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10th.
Chris Wallace asked you about this reason.
Sanders said that the absence of the press conferences was not because he did not like television reporters; though she used to say, I also agreed that the reporters were a lot of things.
Then she suggested that she increase the direct connection between President Pip and the press.
The president is now taking more questions than any previous president. She adds more without giving proof: We have looked at the number of meetings.
Sanders said there would still be press conferences, but if the press had a chance to ask the President of the United States, it would be much better than talking to me.
We've tried a lot, and you've seen that we've been doing a lot of things over the last few weeks, which will replace a press conference when you can talk directly to the President of the United States.
President Stealp regularly answers questions when he left the White House or when he attended the opening session or during meetings of the newspaper when he visited.
Simple press conferences are often very rare.
This week, in New York, the president should have declared the reason but he appeared suddenly with a strange form in front of the reporters.
The Secretary of Health wrote to members of the European Union who worked in the medical industry in Scotland to talk about the fear of Brexit.
The Minister of Health wrote to members of the European Union who worked in the medical industry in Scotland to express their gratitude and wish that the staff remain in Brexit.
Service Minister Jeane Freeman sent a letter with a message that would resign within six months as soon as the British Empire withdrew from the European Union.
The Scotland government pledges to support the bills to confirm the safety of citizens of the European Union who work in the printing industry.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: ‘ During this summer’s conversation between England and the European Union about how the European Union continues to take place, planning to be made in this fall.
But the English government is also promoting the planning work for the script that may not reach the agreement.
I know that this is a bad time with all of you.
That's why I'd like to remind you that now I appreciate the contribution of each staff, whatever their nationality is.
Moreover, those who come from the European Union have given us valuable experience and skills to help strengthen and improve health services and also benefit our patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home, and we'd like you to stay. . . . . . . . . . . . .
Christion Abercrombie had to undergo an emergency surgery after his head injury.
The borderback of the Tennessee Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, had to undergo an emergency surgery after his head in the fall of 31-27 before Vanderbilt Commodes on Saturday, Mike Organ in Tennessee believes.
Captain of Tennessee, Rod Reed told the reporters that the injury had happened just before the holiday break.
He ran toward the border along and fell to the ground, and Reed said.
The coachs and medical staff gave Abercrombie to breathe in front of the border before they put him to bed and took him to another test.
A state official from Tennessee told Chris Harris at the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was diagnosed with Vanderbilt health.
Harris adds: There's details on how much damage to the damages, and Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury is happening.
Abercrombie, the second year student of the red team, first time in the color of Tennessee after moving back from Illinois.
He had five games together on Saturday before he got rid of the game and he had a total of 18 games in this season.
The foreigners who buy real estate in England will be more taxed.
The foreigners who buy real estate in England will be more taxed, this increase will be used to help homeless people follow Tory's new policy.
This change will cause success in the effort to attract Corbyn's young election
The tax increase will apply to those who do not pay taxes in England
This policy policy will help to increase up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
The foreigners who buy real estate in England will be more taxed -- this increase will be used to help homeless people, Prime Minister either by May will be released today.
This change will effectively effect the efforts of Jeremy Corbyn’s youth to make a commitment to provide a lower price and target a high income subject.
The increase of tax will be applied to individuals and non - taxes in Britain, which will move the government’s efforts to fight the present state of affairs.
In addition to today’s tax costs, including higher tax rates were published two years ago to the second house and purchases so that it could go up to three percent.
This change of finance will increase up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new estate was built in London for non - British people who had been not a member of the U.S. government, which kept the price of their house high and made their purchases more difficult.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become a ghost - because most foreigners buy most of their time in another country.
New policy was given just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help many young people who had the opportunity to own their first home.
He accused large construction companies to keep high estate prices by taking the land but did not use them, and he called the prime minister May to give up their house - to - prices to overcome family problems in England.
Corbyn also announced a series of home reforms to attract votes, including the control of the rent and the ending of the charges.
He also wanted to give the board more power to build a new home.
Mrs. May said: ‘ Last night I said that I'd spend my time in restoring English dream - that life would be better for the new generation.
And that means it's going to have to bring the market back to the market now.
England will always open the door for those who want to live, work, and build their lives here.
However, this does not mean that people who do not live in Britain and those with office office could easily buy houses like those of England.
For a lot of people, the dream of possession of a home has become too far away and its maintenance is still very great.
Jack Ross: \"My last hope is to lead the Scotland team.\"
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross said that his last wish was to become the S management of the Scotland team at some point.
Scot, 42 years old, is facing the challenge of the North Korean club, now holding the third position at League One, three points less than the first position.
He moved to the light campaign this summer after taking St. Miren back to Scotland’s season.
I want to fight for my country as a player.
I've got a hat with Dr. B, and that's what I want.
: My childhood stuck to those battles in Scotland that took place in Hampden with my father, and that was always what I remembered.
However, that opportunity will come if I succeed in conducting the club.
Sunderland's managers before Ross including Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Nell, Roy Keane, Gussyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach Alloa Athali said he didn't feel pressure when he was next to the great ones at such a big club, he refused the offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
Will you be judged by 'I can take the club back to the Premier League?'
The structure and facilities at this club are no doubt part of the Premier League prize, he says.
It's not an assignment to achieve easily, but I just consider myself a success if I can get the club back to the tournament.
Ross had three years as managers, after a while as manager at Dumbton and 15 months in his training in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa to restore his position after falling to third grade, and took St. Miren from the risk of losing his post-in-the-warst to the next season champion.
Ross says he's feeling very comfortable now during his football career at clydepool, Harlepool, Falkirk, Streren, and useful Academical.
: It may be a real turn of Loneth - he remembers in the role of leading Alloa.
I really believe that I am in a better position as manager than I am.
This may sound strange because I've been quite successful, successful, and achieved certain achievements as a player.
But it's usually not easy.
There's a lot of things you have to face every week.
I still have to endure stress and pressures from the work, but I feel satisfied with my management work.
I've always wanted to do my manager's job and now I'm doing it, and I'm most comfortable being myself during my adult life.

The summer sun has increased the sales for bars having difficulty in England but has added pressure to restaurants.
According to data, the bars and the bar have seen the increase of 2,7 percent in July, but the sales at restaurants have dropped 4,8%.
Peter Martin, of CGA business advisers, combined the data, says: \"The lengths and British recruits in World Cup are more likely to sell out of July, as if the bars increase 2,8 percent, the restaurants are more powerful.
It's been lost by restaurants in June, and it's worse in July.
At least, bars and bars on drinks are the fastest growth rate in comparison to the drop-out in restaurants.
Food bars are also affected by heat, although they are not as serious as restaurants.
Looks like everyone just wants to drink.
It's about selling drinks in bars and bars that's run by 6% during a month while the sales of food reduced to 3%.
Paul Alvarez, an expert in entertainment and the RSM Hotel, states: “These outcomes have shown the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and impacts of social events or big sports are still the biggest factors that still come to business in restaurants.
It's not surprising that restaurants continue to have problems, low income, four percent less than the same year before when cost pressure continues to increase.
It's a long hot summer that's going on right at the worst time for food players who don't know in August when the cooler weather can improve the situation.
The total growth in stores and restaurants, including new locations, was 2,7 percent in July, reflecting the reciprocation of the development of trade.
Coffer Peach Bookr for bars, bars and restaurants in Britain have gathered and distributed data from 47 groups working, with over nine billion pounds of gold, and that's the right point of the field.
One of the five children has secret social accounts that parents don't know.

The result of 8,000 students' surveys showed that the number of pages in the virtual package has increased dramatically
The news has raised concerns about the growth of pornography on the Internet
Twenty percent of students say that they have a bank account - to show their parents.
A fifth of children -- some of the 11-year-olds -- are creating social media accounts that they keep secret to adults.
A survey with 20,000 primary students revealed rapid growth in the accounts of Insta, who referred to the pages of Instagram.

Cheapstle adulation compared to mothers with milk that divides online comments.
A milk - based machine company that divides online comments with a commercial compared to mothers for feeding with milked cattle.
To mark the release of the product, it is considered that milk - smoking can wear and not cause the world's first noise.
Four mothers danced in the barn with dry grass after a song that says: \"Yes, I'm milking their own milk, but you don't see any tails and -- in case you don't realize it, it's not my breasts, they're my breasts.
Keep going: milk milk, milk, milk, I'm feeding kids, sucking milk, sucking milk, I'm milking my girls.
However, this commercial, posted on the Facebook site of the company, has caused a lot of debate on the Internet.
With 717 turn, and hundreds of comments, this video has received many opposite reactions from audiences, many of which suggest that this commercial has simply been viewed as a little bit less than it would have been.
A bad decision to use cattle to commercial this product.
Like us, they have to bear and bear children to produce milk, except for the bull that is taken from their mother within a few days after birth, a writer.

Another person commented: “This could cause mental damage both her mother and her child.
Yes, why not use a printer to provide milk for mothers who are feeding their baby? ’
Another commentary: It has nothing to do with it.
There are people who protect the advertising, a woman who admit she sees the song very funny.
I think it's a unique idea.
I'll get one for myself if I still give a baby.
The smoking really makes me feel like an ox.
It's kind of crazy, but I understand its message.
This is a unique product, one who observes.
Another comment: This is an interesting commercial that targets mothers who need to smoke at work or in toilets, and they feel like cattle.
This isn't a advertising commercial or anthropic industry. . . . . . . . . .
At the end of the video, the women revealed that they danced with a milk - burning machine hidden in their underwear.
The idea behind this campaign is, in fact, that many women smoke milk to make the baby feel like oxs.
However, the Elvie milk machine did not cause any noise, no wire or pipes, and kept deep inside the breast, helping women to move, to take the baby, and even to go out when they were smoking.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother comments: smoking Elvie is really a artificial product, deserve a violent presentation and encourages curiosity.
When we compare women to sheep, we want people to know about dairy products and related challenges, and we also show joy and sympathy for the freedom that the new products give our mothers.
This isn't the first time Elvie dairy started on notice.
During London’s fashion week, a two - year - old mother showed up on the catwalk floor of Marta Jakubbski as she was using this product.
Hundreds of quiet immigrants would have moved to a camp in Texas border.
The number of locked children who were held in custody has increased, although the number of people who crossed the border for months is almost constant, part because of the harsh arguments and legal policies that the authorities have caused the process to take children to be more difficult for donors.
According to traditional tradition, most donors have had no papers, and they are concerned that receiving a child could affect the ability to stay in their own United States.
The threat increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential donors and other adult members of their family would have to get prints, and this data would be shared with the migration agency.
The last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of Diism and Navy, gave a witness in front of the Congress that the agency had arrested tens of thousands of people who had applied for help for young people who had no guardians.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those who had never been arrested had never been reported.
For 80 percent of the donors or member of the donors are illegal here, and most of them have a record of record.
So, we're continuing to judge these individuals. , Mr. Albence says.
According to the refugee camps, in order to be able to deal quickly with these children, officials have made a new arrangement that requires some donors to appear in court within a month held, rather than after 60 days, according to their standard.
Many will appear through the video conference, instead of being directly present, to justify their legal identity before a settler.
Those judged were not qualified for assistance would be released quickly.
As long as children are incarcerated, they become increasingly anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent acts or to try to escape, as well as the employees at refugees and according to reports from the system in recent months.
The advocates say that anxiety has increased in such a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where they see a child in trouble with more likely to be ignored by the scale of the camp.
They add that bringing children to the city of refugees without enough time to prepare a child or say good - bye to your friends who can cause emotional damage that many youths are suffering.
Syria offered 'the power of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately from the country.
Speaking before the United Nations Council, Secretary Walid al-Moum also called on the Syrian refugees to return to the country, although the civil war entered the eighth year.
Moualem, vice president, says that foreign forces were illegal in Syria, under the name of the terrorist force, so that they would be taken care of.
They had to get rid of Syria without condition, and he immediately appeared before the council.
Moualele emphasized that the fight against terrorism in Syria was near the end of the period of more than 37,000 people who had died since 2011, with millions of people who had to leave their home.
He said Damascus will continue to fight in this holy war until we set out the terrorist groups out of all Syria. And the illegal presence of foreign forces.
Now the United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, trained and counseling both Kurd and Arabs against President hardly alAssad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the country that are at war.
On the matter of refugees, Moualem says that the country was once good enough to return, and he blames them for some Western countries.
We called the international community and humanitarian organizations to make the refugees return.
They're using political cards for human problems
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no backup for Syria until there was a political deal between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The U.S.U. reports the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey about establishing a neutral area in the last Idlib territory of Idlib have created opportunities for political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a major attack on the Russian forces that have been fought against this province, where three million people are living.
However, Moualele emphasized this agreement: there is a time limit, and it reveals that military action will target the holy elements of war, including soldiers from the platform that are connected to Al-hor, are the objects of destruction.
Agent of the United Nations of Staffan de Mistura will soon gather the first meeting of the new committee including government and opposing members to prepare for the war after Syria and open the way for election.
Moualem set the conditions for Syria’s participation in this committee, and he said that the committee’s work limited only to the task of making a case of legal services, and alerting them not to interfere with the election.

federal prosecutors are offering a death sentence for suspect attack on New YorkC.
The federal prosecutors in New York are offering suicide charges for Sayfullo Gapov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City killed eight people who had not yet been executed in this state for federal crime since 1953.
Wrongpov, 30 years old, was said to have used a car for Home Depot's hired truck to carry an attack on West Sideway in Lower Manhattan, stabbed into a walker and rode on October 10.
In order to justify the death sentence, the prosecutors would have to prove that Gapov was the idea of killing eight victims and saying that it was a serious damage to the body, according to the statement that death penalty was committed in South New York.
Both crimes could be sentenced to death in court.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury accused Sappov of a 22 - year charges of murder, often used by federal prosecutors in organized crime and accused of violence and destruction of a terrorist.
The attack was called for the plan and the pay-and-diffies of the prosecutors who said, as describing the method of Sapov that Sapov is now known as cruel, cruel, and innocent.
:Syfullo Habibullavicipov had been injured, damaged, and lost to his family and friends, Diego Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, imageowerv, Erlij, Hernan Ferranchi, Hernan Menza, and Alejandro, according to the press of the court.
Five victims are tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York City was executed.
Reported, Edwind Barnes, sentenced to death by two drug donors but was finally sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last time the death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York City in 1953, in 1953 with Ethel Rosenberg, a couple were executed after they were convicted of a spy on the Soviet War in the last two years.
This couple was executed with electricity on June 19, 1953.
Wrongpov, an Unconzin, does not show regret after the attack, according to the court's document.
He declared to the researchers that he was feeling good about what he did, the police told him.
Wrongpov told authorities that he was inspired to perform an attack after the video of ISIS on the phone, according to the report.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, the police told me.
He didn't confess to the 22-year-old charges.
David Patton, one of the federal defendors who represents Sappov, said that they were completely exposed to the prosecutor’s decision.
We think that decisions to perform death rather than accept a life sentence without the ability to release will only last the pain of this event for those related to Patton.
The protocists of Gaipov earlier asked the prosecutors not to make death sentence.
Guards think that NIGEL FARAGE must take responsibility for Brexit.
Wendell Farage declared he would be in the population in a protest at the security conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians must have received heat from the European thinkers -- for one of the senators of the Prime Minister just suggested that he should be responsible for dealing with the European Union.
The supporters of Peter Bone spoke on the tour of Birmingham that England's kingdom came out of the alliance right now if Mr. Farage was Minister Brexit.
But the challenge that General May faced as he tried to compromise the depth of the unity between the conservatives, supporting his staying in the European Union, was involved in a protest against Brexit.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain the compromise between assaults from those who support Brexill, those who support the European Union and the European Union.
The allies claim that she's going to move by trying to get a deal with use in spite of a violent reaction - and forceing those who believe in Europe and the labor Party to choose between their plans and 'the confusion today'.
Mr. Bone spoke during the LAAA Meanwhiles Verave at Solilul that he wanted 'to challenge Chequers' plans.
He suggested that Farage stay in the Senate and be held responsible for the negotiations with Mr. Farage.
If he's responsible, we may now be out of the alliance - you speak.
Senator Wellingborough adds: 'I'll support Brext, but we need to object to Cheqes plan.'
The Senate gave his objection to the European Union: 'We don't fight during world wars to submit to others.
We want to build our own laws.'
Mr. Bone denied that the opinion changed since the vote in 2016: 'The British thought that the people had changed their minds and wanted to stay in the alliance was completely wrong.'
The man who supported the Brexitist of Andrea Jenkyns was also at the protest, speaking to the reporter: 'I just wanted to say, 'The Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Not many people approve of Chequers' plan, the opposing party wouldn't vote for this plan, which often doesn't happen to our party, our worker, who's willing to call for support from the people and vote for us from the beginning.
Let's give up Chegins' plans and listen to the people.'
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: 'The prime minister keeps his chair when they keep their promises to the people.'
Mr. Farage said that politicians had to participate in protests to receive heat if they changed their decision to be given in a public demand in 2016.
This is a matter of faith between us and the political class.
'They're trying to give up Brexit and we're here today to say 'we won't let you do it.\"'
In a message to his supporters, he added: 'I want to let the political class go, who's intended to change Brexi, feel the heat of the situation.
'We're moving the people, who brought us to the victory of Brexi and we'll never surrender until we become an independent Kingdom, rule and pride.'
Meanwhile, the supportors moved through Birmingham before hosting a two - hour protest in the center of the city.
Some of the leaders raised their leaders against Brexill after leaving their eyes at the end of the week.

He said that during the West Virginia campaign, the president did not directly target the release by Ford in front of the Senate Committee, instead he commented that what was going on at the Senate was happening at the Senate, showing that people were bad and not honest.
If something happens and what's happening over the last few days at the Senate is wonderful, you can feel anger, you can see people angry, bad, and unhappy, and not honest.
( b) When they saw articles and read the news leaking, they said: ‘ Look, I'm not the one who did it.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak the news?

Another black man?
My sister NY accused the couple of fired you after a private message.
A young lady in New York City accused a married couple who fired her from a distinction after she missed a wrong message from her mother who complained that she was a black man.

Lyssley Plique-Flaxman, a mother of two children, was depressed to find out about her new nurse, Gisssco, who was black on the first day she arrived in 2016.
Despite all of this, I have not been able to get a copy of the books I have written to my husband.
However, instead of sending a message to her husband, she sent it twice.
After she realized the mistake, she was hoping that she would have had a little girl not yet, after her release, she said that the African breast is about to quit from doing something bad and that she hoped she would have a baby girl who was not, according to New York Post.
“ My sister was paid by the day and went to Uber on her own.
Now, Ms. time was set for a couple of couples to pay for their premise behavior with $350 a day for the job you were hired to receive money, even though they didn't sign any contracts.
I want to show them, look, you don't do anything like that. She says to Post on Friday, and I know it's a difference.
The couple objected to accusations that they were religious people who said that the end of the job was reasonable because they feared that they couldn't trust her after having offended her.
I sent her a message she didn't want to send.
She's not a racialist.
We're not racialists. The husband Joel Plco said to the Post.
: But can you give your children to someone you have offended, even a mistake?
What about the baby?
Let's talk.
When comparing the case with a money case, Pl preachs that his wife has only two months of birth and that she is in a very difficult situation.

Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, was born soon after the book was widely accepted, the letter revealed: It was hard to put herself in the position of another person when she read the book for the first time being published.
It's amazing that we now know about the grand success of Paddington.
In speaking of his father, a film filmist for the use of his 60th birthday, was inspired to write the book for children from a small toy bear, he was still very optimistic when his work was rejected, and she shared it with the 60th anniversary of the book, which was a confusion after his death last year.
When she spoke of Madington, she described him as a very important member of our family. She added her father’s pride in his success.
He's a pretty chronic man, and he's not an active man, you say.
: But sinceaddington actually exists with him, it's almost like you have a child and he's going to reap certain successs: you're proud of them even when they don't really exist.
I think you've seen the work ofaddington that way.
Although it was the product of his creativity and imagination, he always took a certain position foraddington.
My daughter died and I had to say good-bye on the phone.
As soon as she landed her daughter, she was in a hurry to go to Louis Pike Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors tried to save her but in vain.
I'm calling Nad regularly to say it's bad and she's not supposed to be like that, Miss Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then I received a call from Nad saying that she would stop breathing for two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, Talshi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll see you soon.
I'll always be with you.
The doctors pumped heart aid and slowly pulled the tube out of her body.
She stopped breathing a few times and this is the last time.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all of this hasn't stopped.
I can't cry or cry or cry because I'm with my family and everybody.
I'm supposed to be the one who's got them.
In the end, Miss Ednan-Laperouse, who is still grieving by her daughter's departure, has been on a plane with other passengers-to-faced with the challenge she'll have to overcome.
No one knows what you're talking about.
I bow my head and cry all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, I felt sorry for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her.
The grieving woman posted a card to stop suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost their lives by suicide are trying to prevent others from stealing their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on the Welsh bridge with inspired messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old, experienced depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don't want any parents to be in the sense that I have to go through every single day.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old, lived in Lydney, stating that her son was a promising cook with a smileful smile.
Everyone knows about it for that smile.
They used to say his laughs light all the rooms.
However, he left work before he committed suicide because he found himself in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother, was gone the same way after he ended his life.
Ms. Davis said: \"I'm worried that there's going to be a chain reaction
Ms. Davis designed cards, so that people know that there are always people that you can meet, talk, or even make friends.
Don't live in silence - you need to talk.
Miss Humphreys, who was friends of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, a mate 15 years ago, soon after his mother's death.
He doesn't talk about feeling bored or disappointed or anything like that.
Some days before Christmas, we found that he changed his attitude.
He's sick of school on Christmas Day -- when kids open presents and he doesn't want to keep an eye on them or anything around him.
She said that her husband’s death was a very great damage to them, but they still had to try to overcome it: this caused a huge breach in our family.
It broke our hearts.
But we all keep living and fight it.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is hanging out when the FBI begins to investigate.
Mr. Flake said on Saturday that I think, if we could actually have something like what he asked-- a limited investigation of time, we could get a little bit, and he said that he was afraid that he would be caught in the affairs of the parties.
Why would Mr. Kavanaugh and the Republicans want to investigate?
Their neglect is just a matter of time.
The election of the mid - week period, on November 6, as expected, the Republicans are in a very bad situation, which is going to be much worse in their attempt to find the representative they want to be elected to the highest position.
George W. View phoned the senators, acting in support of Mr. Kavalaugh, who was once a white House assistant under President network, from which he could approach his wife, Ashley, who used to be a personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI released reports?
There will be a vote at the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 partyrs are.
Now it's not clear whether Mr. Kavalaugh might have received at least 50 votes of the Senate, which allowed Mike Pence, which is now vice president, desensitating and confirmed position in the Supreme Court.
The number of Korean escapeers is under Mr. Kim's time.
The number of Korean runaways has been strong since Kim Jong-un took over seven years ago, a ruler in Korea speaking.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South President of Korea, said there were 1,127 escapes - compared to the F.6 escape in 2011.
Mr. Park says it's the main elements of this change.
PARENT did not make public comments.
Most of the escapers from North Korea were eventually released from Korea.
Seoul says that over 8,000 Koreans have crossed their limits since the end of the war of Korea in 1953.
Most escaped through China, which is the longest bordered country with North Korea, and they can easily cross the military zone in the middle of two countries.
China viewed escapeers as illegal immigrants, not refugees and often forced them to return to their homeland.
The relationship between North Korea and South Korea is still in a state of war that has improved greatly in recent months.
Early this month, the leaders of both countries met in Ping to have negotiations focused on nuclearization.
These behaviors took place after a historical encounter in June between President of the United States and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, both sides agreed with open terms to move towards North Korea.
But on Saturday, the Secretary of State of North Korea, Ring-Ho blames America’s punishments for the delaying of the process.
If there is no confidence in the U.S. side of the United Nations there will be no confidence about our national security problems and in that case, there will be no other way that we will find a solution to our own safe solution to Mr. Ri in the United Nations Council at New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavalaugh, which is too encouraging to say, he was not fit at the Supreme Court.
The chief leader of Nancy Pelosi called the man who was assigned to the Supreme Court, Bret Katvalaugh as an overthanctical leader, and said that he was temporarily in need of service at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on an interview that took place on Saturday at Texas Tribune's Church in Austin, Texas.
I can't help you, but I think that if a woman did that, they would call it 'The Dead Dead Man,';' said Pelosi about his reaction to Kavalaugh's testimony before the Senate Committee on Thursday.
Kavalaugh insisted on refusing the charges that he had attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavalaugh expressed a lot of feelings, and there were times when he almost cried and was told about his family and five months in high school.
He also strongly condemned the democracy before the committee, calling on the charges against him to be an act of close-up action, which was well - prepared to be angry because Aldous Alden lost in the President’s election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavalaugh's testimony proved that he was not suitable for the Supreme Court, because he was clearly acting against the Democratic Party.
I think he'd removed his own identity when he made his claim and treated his family as he spoke about the Clinton and the Democratic Party, she said.
Pelosi refused to ask if she had tried to accuse Kavalaugh not if he was confirmed, and if the democracy had gained a majority of votes in the House.
I'm going to say this-if he doesn't tell Congress or FBI, he's not only with position at the Supreme Court where he still has to explain it in front of the Court of Pelosi.
Kavalaugh is now judge at the D.C.
Pelosi added, as a democracy, she was interested in Kavalaugh's ability to make a ruling against the health care Act of money or Roe. So, because he was considered a security judge.
In the ceiling, Kavalaugh got away from the question whether he would change some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
This is not the time for an overtight person to take his position in court and hope we're going to say, 'Isn't this great,' said Pelosi.
Women need to know how to use it.
It's actually a heavy criticism, month after month, year after year, and year after year, she can't pass without crying.
We cry when we're angry; Ms. Steinem tells me after 45 years.
I don't think it's unusual, you know
She went on, I was helped by a woman who was a senior director, she said she was crying when she was angry but to make her reaction when she was angry and she started crying, you'd tell the person you talked to, you might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry.
And you keep crying.
And I think this is great.
You're allowed to cry for this act to be part of a way out of anger because basically they're misunderstanding.
One of my most profound memories at work at the first company was that it was a place for men, I was crying when I was angry, which was when I was being hit by an old woman -- the cold manager always scared me-- had pulled me into the stairs.
You tell me - Don't let them see you cry.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and satisfied because they're with you.
Patricia Schroeder, who later became a Democratic senator in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidental campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught into an affair on a boat called Munk Business and was left of the race, Mrs. Schroeder was greatly disappointed, that there was no reason for her to be able to stand up for president.
30 years later she smiles and tells me it's not a wise decision
: There are seven other candidates in the race, and they need another candidate.
Someone called this race \"The White White White White White and the Seven Littles.\"
Because of being late for the campaign, she was lost in the fundraising campaign, so she swore that she wouldn't be in campaign unless she was in charge of 2 million dollars.
The war has failed.
She found out that some people who supported her $5,000 instead of 1,000 dollars to support the male candidate.
You wonder if they think I'm down.
When she declared that she was not going to start an official campaign, she went through her feelings - expressed appreciation for the people who supported her, disappointed with the system of fundraising and targeting the campaigns rather than the delegates, she became angry because she was influenced by her status - that she was the source.
You may think that I have been mentally depressed, Mrs. Schroeder's memory of how the press has reacted to me.
You thought Kleenex was my company's assistant.
I remember thinking about what they would put on my gravestones?
Do you cry?
American trade war--it could be a good signal for Beijing.
Experts say that reliefs are open to a business battle between America and China that has been suspended, and the war will continue, the crack in the nations could be an advantage for Beijing.
Early this year, Donald Chemp, president of the United States, gave the first warning by taxing China's principal taxes including solar and steel and aluminium.
The increasing growth in recent weeks with the worth of 200 billion dollars (50 billion pounds) hit half of China's bank lines into the United States.
Beijing paid back by increasing taxes from five to ten percent to 60 billion dollars of American goods.
China pledges to backbacks to the behavior of the American side and the second largest economy of the world can hardly be shaken soon.
Making Washington compromises means that Beijing has to offer requests, but openly accept the loss of the United States is too embarrassing for Mr. Peaceman, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing can give the correct move, the long-term pressure of commercial war with America could be a positive signal by reducing the effects of two economics.
In fact, a political decision in Washington or North America can start an economic relationship in one of two countries, and this is much more dangerous than what was previously acknowledged of Grace, an expert who focused on Asia in the U.S. Security Center of America, giving comments.
Syria's ready to return the refugees, the Secretary of State declared.
Syria said that they were ready to let the refugees come back and call for help to restore the country that had been destroyed by the war for over seven years.
Speaking before the United Nations Council, Secretary Walid al-Moume said that the conditions in this country are being improved.
: Today, the state situation is more stable and secure because of the progress in the war against terror - speaking forces, if clear.
The government continues to reform areas destroyed by terrorists to restore living conditions
All these conditions are now ready to let the refugees return from their country because of terrorism and the economic conditions that affect their everyday life and birth.
The United Nations estimated that over 55 million Syria had left the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million others in this country are in need of humanitarian support.
Al-Moulem says that Syria will welcome the help of rebuilding the country.
But he emphasized that the nation would not accept conditions or assistance from countries who supported the rebellion.
