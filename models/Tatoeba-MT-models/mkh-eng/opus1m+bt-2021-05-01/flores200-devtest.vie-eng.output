Although the horses are only made up of parallel logs, they allow horses to pull at faster speeds and load larger loads than they go on daily roads.
It was quite soon known to hold tracks in position, however, gradually they realized that they would work more effectively if they had a small piece of metal.
This has become the custom, yet iron has caused the wheels to worse.
The same wooden wheel was replaced with iron wheels, in 177 the first metal tracks were released.
The first protocol known as walking, people began to walk two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, were not walking straight.
The characteristics of the legs were found in the Australopicus fossils from 4,2,92,9 million years ago, though Sahelanthropus may have traveled with two legs of seven million years ago.
We can start to be friendly with our environment, we can participate in the environmental movement, and we can also become an active worker because of our environment to reduce the weight of our future.
But if we don't just want a temporary solution, we need to figure out the source of the problem and how to stop it.
Clearly, the world has changed so much since its accomplishments in science and technology, and problems have become even more serious because of increasing populations and the endless human way of life.

The main purpose of science is to figure out how the world works through scientific method, which has actually led most of the science studies.
But not only has trials and tests is an experiment that is used to eliminate a or many theories that can be asked questions and perform observations, as well as guidance for scientific research.
natural scientists and philosophers focused on ancient texts and especially the Latin Bible.
Granted, Aristotle's view of all the scientific matters, including psychology.
When knowledge of Greece was broken, West saw that he was cut off from Greek philosophy and Greek science.
Many rhythms that are observed in psychology and behavior often depend on the presence of internal cycle and the birth of these sounds through biological clocks.
The patrol, not just the feedback of the outside patrol, has been recorded for most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
A biologic clock is a self-stabilization and will continue the cycle of freedom even if it doesn't affect from outside.
Hershey's experiment and Chase are one of convincing evidences that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershy and Chase used bacteria, or virus, to plant their own DNA into bacteria.
They've done two experiments to mark the DNA chain inside the bacteria in a chemical compound called radiation or protein of radiation bacteria.
The gene transformation can cause various effects based on the kind of mutinity, the importance of the genetic being affected and the cells being affected by the type of cells.
Only mutants in bacteria can pass to children, while mutants can cause cells or cancer.

In the animal transport system, everyone's connected and supports a separate car transport system.
Today, science has claimed that this vast carbon economy has pushed out of its stable state that has helped humans to progress over the past two million years.
Everyone is involved in society and uses traffic systems, which most people complain about these traffic systems.
In developing countries, you rarely hear similar media about water quality or collapse.
Why did the traffic system cause complaints, why did they make regular mistakes?
Writing is the working of separate drivers and vehicles between two points as well as how they interact with each other.
Woe to you, it's hard to study traffic saving because you can't make sure a hundred percent of your driver's behavior.
It is fortunate that the drivers tend to behave in a appropriate range; so traffic flows tend to be united in a reasonable way and can represent mathematical expression.
To simulate more than the traffic, the relationship between the three major features was set: (1) the range, (2) the density, and (3) the speed.
These relationships help make plans, design, and operate land facilities.
The ability to prevent their enemies from looking for food and friendship is more effective.
Most insects have the advantage of getting their wings back along their body.

Humans have known fundamental elements such as gold, silver, and the same from ancient times, because all those elements can be discovered in the natural nature and relatively easy to exploit using original tools.
Aristotle suggests that everything was made of a combination of one or more of four factors, which was the country, the water, the wind, and the fire.
This is like the four conditions of matter (in the same order): snakes, liquids, and plasma, although he suggests that they turn into new substances to form what we see.
Basically, it's the mixture of two metal coming up, don't forget that there are many elements on the panel.
The elements, such as calcium and kalli, are considered metal, of course, also like gold and silver.
You can also have these metal compounds containing a small amount of metal elements like carbon.

The atoms are so small that thousands of atoms can only be larger than a dot at the end of this verse.
So from new days on, pencils have become a good friend of many.
Sadly, as new writing methods appear, pencils lose their standing and are less likely to be used.
Today, humans are texting on a computer screen, never going to a pencil.
People can only ask themselves how the keyboard is going to be when something's new comes up.
Well, nuclear molecules function based on the principles of energy to combine atoms with a lot of electrons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy load of trucks on the hill again and then removing some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nuclear age, which means that they tend to break down with little or no impact.
The surface of the Moon is made of stone and dust, the outer layer of the moon is called the skin.
The shell is about 70 kilometers [70 km] thick on the left side and about 100 kilometres on the clear surface of the Moon.
It's thiner under maria and thicker in the highland.
There may be more areas that affect closeness because the thiner shell is more likely to rise off the surface.
The theory of content focuses on finding out what makes people pay attention or draws them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desire to receive from outside when they grow up.

The two popular theories are the Maslow Bridge and Hertzberg’s Two Textections.
In general, there are two kinds of actions that can appear when the manager begins leading his former colleagues, the first one is trying to maintain a close relationship.
This kind of manager is difficult to make common decisions, applying discipline, efficiency, responsibility, and keeping people involved in a responsible way.
Someone will turn into a completely different person and feel they have to change everything that the whole group is doing and do it themselves.
After all, the leader has to take full responsibility for the success and failure of the team.
This action sometimes leads to the breach between leadership and other members of the team.
It's a long way from work group to meet the standard of quality as traditional team, but there are small differences.
The members of the virtual team often take function as the link to their close association with them.
They often have more self - control than normal members because their team can meet in different time frames, which may not be understood by their local administration.

Before an organization can be created, the leadership needs to create creative culture and share the knowledge and insight of the whole group.
Angel (2006), explain the constant method of using the Internet as a means to help organizations improve their performance.
The neuroscientical data provides physical evidence for a theory method of investigation of consciousness, so it's smaller in range of research and makes it more accurate.
The connection between brain disease and how to deal with scientists during their study.
We've known that different types of brain injury, trauma, depression, and tumors have affected behavior and have caused some brain effects.
The development of new technology allows us to look at and study structures and brain processes that we've never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and information to build simulations that help us understand the process of the brain.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) has great meaning in fiction science, AI also illustrated a very important branch in computer science, handling behaviors, learning skills and intelligent simulations of machines.
The study of artificial intelligence involves the autonomy of tasks that require intelligent behavior.
The examples include control, planning, and schedules, the ability to answer the diagnosis and questions of the client, as well as the identification of hand, voice and face.
Things like that have become their own rules, focusing on providing solutions to practical matters in life.
The AI system today is often used in economics, medical, technology, and military functions, as well as in various computer applications and video games.
The real trip was an important part of the classroom, and teachers were quite often taking students to places where the bus was not an option.
The technology provides solutions by virtual journeys, students can see museums, spasms, or viewers while sitting in their classrooms.
Shareing a trip through online form is also an excellent way to reflect on the journey and share experiences of later students.
For example, every year Bennett students in North Carolina will design a website of their journey to the state capital, which is remodeled every year, but old versions are kept online to remember.
Blog can also help improve students' ability to write, when they start writing blog, these students often make their own sense of speech and self - righteousness, the presence of their readers in general, and the presence of the audience in general, that changes it.
Education is often the most difficult critics, so blog writers began to try to improve the quality of articles in order to avoid criticism.
At the same time, when writing blog, the students had to become better acquainted with the world around them, which was vital for the attention of the audience to be smart and interesting.
Blog is a tool to promote cooperation and encourage students to expand their learning out of the traditional classroom.
Using appropriate blog sites, which can help students to be more sensitive to the ability to analyze and reason; through positive response to information on the Internet, students can determine their role in the context of others as well as their viewpoints on specific matters (Ovevec, 2002).
