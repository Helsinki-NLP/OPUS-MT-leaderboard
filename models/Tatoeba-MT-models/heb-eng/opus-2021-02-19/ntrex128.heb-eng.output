Members of parliament in Wales are afraid to look like Muppets.
Some members of Parliament were horrified by the proposal that the title of their role would be changed from AMs to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This concern was triggered by plans to change the name of the deleted house to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of parliament at every political spectrum are concerned that this will invite ridicule.
One Labour MP said that his people were afraid that "it would rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means poo.
An MP of the © Pleiade Camari Party said that all his friends were “unsatisfied ” and offered alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his friends were “open to suggestions ” about the change of name, but said that the MWP (the initials of the Welsh MP) sounded a lot like the word "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is expressed in a similar way to the expression of the letter in English in the Yorkshire accent.
The Legislative Committee, which just drafted the legislation to change names, said: "The final decision on any descriptive words regarding the names of members of the House of Representatives is, of course, the decision of the assembly itself."
The Law of the Wales Government of 2017 gave the Welsh legislature the authority to change its name.
In June, the committee released the results of the public consultation on the proposals, in which a broad support was given to change the name of the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the role of members of Parliament (AMS), the committee recommended the 2008 members of the Welsh Parliament, or WMPs, but the MWP has received much of the support of consultation with the public.
Members of Parliament offer alternative options, but the struggle to achieve consensus can cause quite a bit of headache for the chairman of the committee, Elin Jones, who should be filing a draft of legislation regarding the changes in the coming weeks.
The law on reforms will include other changes in the way the House works, including rules to keep members of parliament and the structure of the committees out.
The vote of members of Parliament will ultimately determine the title of their role during legislation.
The citizens of Macedonia go to polls with about changing the state's name
The people will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country’s name to “the Republic of Northern Macedonia. ”
The referendum was set in an attempt to resolve a decades - long dispute with neighboring Greece, where there was a province called Macedonia.
Greece has long claimed that the name from a conscience is a claim to the territory of Greece and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, George ‘ Ivanov, who opposed the referendum for the change of name, said that he would ignore his results.
However, those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that the change of name is simply the price to pay to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent.
According to Mr. Adams, “old neighborhood residents say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner.
“ Today there are no bars nor churches. ”
He says you can understand the disappearances of bars.
“ The social life of people today is different, ” he noted.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood living room where people visit on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from selling property will not last as long as the church leaders expect, “and sooner or later, they will find themselves back at the start.
He said the churches would take the place of condo buildings with condos that house people who aren't the kind to help neighborhoods maintain their unique attribute.
“ The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people, ” he says, “so this will quicken the closure of these churches, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will join these churches.
The two churches were built by believing communities to build, before Harlem became a neighborhood mostly black, the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The white Methodist community left in the 1930s.
A black congregation of believers in the area became the owner of the building.
The Church of St. Martin passed into a black religious community under Reverend John Howard G. Johnson, who led a ban on merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
A 1939 fire caused severe damage to the building, but as part of the plans of the faithful under Reverend Johnson to rebuild it, they ordered the construction of the Crown of Bells.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Johnson Sr. and the one who inherited his place at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the "The Bells of the Poor".
The expert who played the career in July named him "cultural treasure" and "historical irreplaceable tool".
The expert, Tiffany Ing of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first bluebell cryon played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lynde, who later played the Greater Cryon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryweather said St. Martin's Church didn't replace him.
What happened at St. Martin's Church over the past few months was a complex story of architects and contractors, some of which were brought in by the heads of the local church, and others by the Episcopalian diocese.
The meeting — which is the Governing Body of a community of believers composed of local believers — wrote to the bishops in July a letter dissembling her fears that the diocese would “try to roll the costs ” into the meeting, even though the meeting was not involved in recruiting the architects and contractors who sent the bishops.
Some believers complained of the lack of transparency of the diocese.
A shark wounded a 13-year-old boy in a lobster dive.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on a Saturday while the boy was diving to catch lobsters in California on the first day of lobster season, so they gave up officials.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
* Ed Hummel told the KSW-TV network that he had been diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy cry out for help and then rowed there with a group to help lure him to the beach.
Hummel initially thought it was just enthusiastic shouting about the catch of a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
Hummel said that as he approached the boy, he saw that his whole collarbone had been ripped off.
"I shouted for everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!", added Hamel.
The boy was flown to Radi Hospital in San Diego where his condition is defined as human.
We don't know what kind of shark attacked the boy.
Rescue Chief Larry Giles said in a press briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined not to be a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Authorities have closed access to the coast between Ponto Beach in Csvald and Swami Beach in Asinitas for 48 hours for interrogation and safety purposes.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to infiltrate the market for beauty products in Britain
Sainsbury's starting a contest with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and opening department store-style aisles with professional saleswomen.
As part of a significant venture to infiltrate the British beauty products market that rolls 2.8 billion a year, and continues to grow as sales in fashion and household products are down, the extended aisles of beauty products will be inspected in 11 stores across the country and if the experiment succeeds, additional stores will be added next year.
The investment in beauty products comes as supermarkets search for ways to use shelves previously captured by televisions, microwaves, and household products.
From Sainsbury's it is reported that the company is expected to double its beauty supply up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. Paw Paw for the first time in its history.
Existing product lines of L'Oral, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be awarded another territory with designated brand areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The Grocery Network also relaunches its makeup line, "Bootique", so that most products will be vegan-friendly, a feature whose demand grows among young buyers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume chain will check franchises at two stores in Sinsbury's, the first of which opened in Croyden, South London, last week and the second will open at Leslie Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and more than buying smaller foods every day in local convenience stores requires supermarkets to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Koopa, CEO of Sinsbury's, said that the branches would become more like department stores as the grocery chain tries to fight against the cheap networks Aldi and Lidl with more services and products that are not food.
Sainsbury's added sales points of Argus in hundreds of stores as well as several hubbitat points since buying both networks two years ago, adding that they uploaded grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
Previous attempts by the network to revive beauty products departments and its pharmacies ended in failure.
Sainsbury's attempted a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but the engagement ended after a dispute over how to divide the profits from drugstores within the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold the business activity of the pharmacies at 281 Celesio, the owner of the Lleoyd pharmacy network for 125 million pounds three years ago.
She says that Loyds will play a role in the program, by expanding the brand supply of high-end leather products, including La Roche-Posey and Vichi, in four stores.
The commercial manager of Sainsbury’s, Paul Mills-Hix, said: “We have made a makeover in the mirror and in the sense of moving our beauty products, to improve the environment for the customers.
In addition, we have invested in highly trained employees who will be available for counseling on the premises.
Our brand supply is designed to match every need and attractive environment our comfortable locations make us an attractive destination for beauty products, in a way that challenges the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby canceled a deal worth 11 million pounds.
TV star Dragons Den, Peter Jones, expressed “frage ” after TV host Holly Willoughby canceled an 11 million-dollar deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and with ITV.
Actually, Willoughby doesn't have time for the brand of home clothes and their accessories.
The joint business of the two is considered to be similar to the Goop brand of the actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced her departure at the post on East Graham.
Holly Willoughby left the star of the show "Dragons Den Peter G. Jones is furious with the fact that at the last minute she canceled the brand of the two prestigious lifestyle to focus on her fat contracts with Marks and Spencer and IV.
Sources say that Jones responded “in a rage ” when the TV star announced during a heated meeting on Tuesday at his corporate offices in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that due to its new trades — up to 1.5 sterling — she did not have enough time to spend the branding of home clothes and their props Truely.
The joint business of the two was thought to be similar to the Goop brand of the actress Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
While the 37-year-old Willaby posted on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones was on a flight from Britain to one of his vacation homes.
According to one source: "Truly was no doubt Holly's priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would provide her income in the next few decades.
A decision to leave has completely surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday. It was so close to the launch.
The company warehouses in Marlow are full of products ready to sell."
Experts believe that leaving the host of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in Britain, can cost the company millions as a result of huge investments in various products, from pillows and candles to house clothes, and the potential for further delay in the launch.
And that could end a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin were close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Tarly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jonas joined as chairman of the company in March.
The couple spent vacations together, and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador to the M&S brand and replace Annette McPertlin as host of the I'm A Celebrity program of ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We are not responding to his business affairs.
* Tough call and then we fell in love *
He joked about the criticism he was getting from the news press for saying that some define him as "not presidential" and that he was so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said in the voice of a news anchor.
"I didn't make any concessions."
He pointed out that Kim wanted a second meeting after praising their first June meeting as a big step in the direction of nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the nuclear disarmament negotiations froze.
More than three months after the conference in June, Singapore, the high-ranking North Korean diplomat Ree Jung Ho told world leaders on Saturday at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see “an agreeable response ” from the United States's side to the initial disarmament measures made by North Korea.
Instead, he says the United States continues sanctions designed to continue the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view of his talk at the rally.
“ We're in great shape with North Korea, ” he said.
"We almost went to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim resulted in positive results -- stopping missile trials, assisting in the release of prisoners and returning the remains of American soldiers home.
And he defended his extraordinary approach in speaking of his relationship with Kim.
“ It is so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full stadium, we had about 200 people standing there, ” Trump said pointing directly at him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia caused the destruction of an island and the killing of hundreds of people.
After the Lumbuk earthquake, for example, we'll tell foreign non-governmental organizations that they don't need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lumbuk lost their homes, there was no national disaster declared, which is a condition to expedite international aid.
“ In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it is a bit challenging, ” said Mrs. Sumbang.
Although the Save the Children organization is preparing a team to go to Palo, it is not clear if foreign messengers will be able to pass through the field.
Mr. Sottopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palo to see if more international services would contribute to the relief effort.
In light of the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unfortunately unprepared for natural disasters.
While tsunamis were built in Acha County, they are rare in other coastal areas.
Likely, the obvious lack of warning alarms on a tsunami in Palo, even though there is a warning, contributed to loss of life.
Even in the best of times, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship that was protecting Lumbuk to treat earthquake victims, making its way to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
Indonesia’s decrepit infrastructure improved at the center of the president’s campaign, and he invested a lot of money on roads and railroads.
But Mr. Guco was present with funding deficits for his contest to be re-elected next year.
Mr. Guku also faced the pressure of ongoing class tensions in Indonesia as a result of the religious allocation of the Muslim majority in the country.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes in battle between Christian and Muslim gangs in the streets using knives, bows, and arrows and other domestic weapons.

The statue of Cromwell Parliament became the next target for attacks on monuments in the struggle around the history of the writings.
Disposing of the statue would be poetic justice in light of the disposing of the Taliban.
But in the Cromwell Society, they claim that Mr. Crick's suggestion is "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith ‘ Chairman of the Cromwell Society ’ said: "It was inevitable that the current controversy of the removal of statues, the character of Oliver Cromwell standing outside the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The sculptures of the civil wars in England were not broken by Cromwell's orders and not carried out by him.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being victimized by the actions of one of his predecessors in the line of Thomas Cromwell in the century before.
The impressive representation of Cromwell in the hands of the sculptor Sir William Hamu Thornycroft is evidence of the view in the 19th century and part of the history of a figure many believe is still worthy of paying tribute.
Mr. Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell was captured by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as defending Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
The question of whether this is a completely accurate assessment is the object of an ongoing historical controversy.
The irrefutable fact is that the struggle in the middle of the 17th century shaped the development of our nation later, and Cromwell is one identified character representing one side of the barricade at the time.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and commemoration."
A deadly pig who would drive a Chinese farmer to death.
Local media sources report that a pig attacked a farmer's death at a market in southwest China.
The man, identified as Yuan, was found dead with a torn artery covered in blood next to the pig pen at the Lufensui Market in Guigão County, reports the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A farmer prepares to inject vaccines to a pig farm on May 30, 2005, in Shenning, Qinghai County, China.
Reports say he drove off Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan County to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next day his cousin found him dead, and found that a door to a pigsty nearby was open.
He said the pen found a large male pig with blood on its mouth.
A criminal investigation confirmed that the 250-pound pig attacked the farmer, according to the report.
"My uncle's feet were filled with blood and tears," said the cousin whose last name was Wu, as quoted in Guiying Evening News.
In security camera footage, Ewan was seen entering the market Thursday morning at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Owen or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked behind bars to prevent him from attacking other people while the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
There's been a negotiation between Yuan's family and the market authorities about compensation for his death.
Although the phenomenon is rare, pigs have been reported to attack humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused mortal injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig pinned a farmer in Wales to his tractor until the farmer's wife drove the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told the BBC news that pigs are not usually aggressive but the taste of blood could be triggers.
“ They’re just playing.
They're like naughty, very inquisitive children... They don't mean you any harm.
"All you have to do is give them the proper measure of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall in vast areas in the southwest of the United States.
According to forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakened as she moves over cooler waters on the north coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
However, the storm Rosa will bring flood rains all over northern Mexico and southwest America over the next few days.
The winds in the storm of Rosa reached a speed of 135 miles per hour, meaning a Class 1 hurricane, and as of Sunday morning at 5am Eastern Standard Time, the epicenter of the storm is 200 miles southeast of Punta Yuge, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a channel over the Pacific is beginning to form that's heading east towards the eastern coast of the U.S., as Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters of rain to parts from Mexico on Monday.
After that, tropical moisture that will combine with the approaching channel will create heavy rainfall in vast areas in the southwest of the United States over the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 100 millimeters of rain would cause flash floods and risk landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will cause rain to reach 50 to 75 millimeters per hour at different points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfalls are 50 to 100 millimeters expected in parts of the southwest U.S.A., especially Arizona.
There may be flash floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to tropical rain.
It is highly recommended to avoid walking long distances in the desert when tropical rain is threatened.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into raging rivers and thunderstorms, bringing strong winds and dust storms.
The approaching channel will bring local rainfall to parts of the Southern California coastline.
There may be total rainfall of over 13 millimeters, which could cause debris drift and smooth roads.
It'll be the first rain in the region in this rainy season.
Scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning, and the rain will grow stronger and will spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the four corners.
In October there may be sharp temperature changes all over the U.S., while the Arctic cools down, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This often leads to dramatic changes in temperature between short distances.
On Sunday, there's an excellent example of extreme temperature changes throughout the center of the United States.
There are temperature differences of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis to Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, prolonged summer heat will try to evolve and expand again.
In early October, temperatures will be warm in most of the central and eastern regions of the United States, moving between 27 and 31 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
In New York City, the temperature may reach 70 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 5 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast shows high odds of higher temperatures than average in East America in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Burt Cavanaugh hearing.
Over 20 million people watched Thursday, in six television networks, in the fascinating testimony of Supreme Court nominee Burt Cavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blazi Ford.
Meanwhile, the political debate continues with breaking news in the middle of regular broadcasts to announce a surprising development on Friday: an agreement written by the Arizona senator J.F.F.F.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Cavanaugh felt her body while drunk and tried to undress her during a high school party.
Cavanaugh, in the flamed-out testimony, said he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers was even higher than the report of 20.4 million viewers on the Nielsen scale.
Nielsen checked the average viewing of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The data was not available immediately for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Vanillan usually has trouble measuring people who watch offices.
In comparison, it's an audience on a scale similar to that of the football playoff game or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen's data, Fox News Channel, which Ferencia enthusiastically supports Cavanaugh's appointment, led from all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a full-day hearing.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen's report.
The level of interest remained high after the hearing.
Senator Flake was the main character in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the moderate Republican senator's office issued an announcement that he would vote for Cavanaugh's nomination, he was filmed by CNN and CBS photographers while a group of protestors shouted at him as he tried to get into the elevator to get to the Judiciary hearing.
He stood looking down for a few minutes while the exhibits rebuked him, with all of this being filmed live on CNN.
"I stand here before you," said one of the women.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office posted a message saying, before the elevator door closed, that he would say more at the committee hearing.
The networks and cables all broadcast live a few hours later, when the legal committee was about to point out Cavanaugh's application for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he'd only vote for the nomination if you got an understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate over the next week, which the Democratic Minority demanded.
Flake was partially persuaded by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After talking to Koons and several senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had power because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the majority to confirm Cavanaugh's appointment without an investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Cavanaugh.

The shooting at Wade Simms, police arrested Deaton Simpson as a suspect in the murder of an LSU player.
Police arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting at Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for the LSU team.
A 20-year-old man named Deaton Simpson was arrested and arrested for murder in the first degree, so the Baton Rouge police found out.
Officials posted a video of Simms and Simpson's confrontation, and according to police, Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said that Simpson's DNA was on them, according to a WAFB network report, which is part of the CBS network.
After the Simpson investigation, according to the police, he confessed to shooting Wade dead.
Bail was set at $350,000, as reported at Advocate.
The M.E. of East Baton Rose released a preliminary report on Friday saying that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
Police have given credit to the Louisiana State Police Escape Task Force, to the State Police Crime Lab, to the Southern University Police Department, and to the citizens in the area who helped in the investigation leading to the capture of the suspect.
The director of athletics at LSU University, J.A., thanked law enforcement authorities in the area for “obsession and persecution of justice.
Simms was 20.
He grew up in Baton Rose, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the University of LSU.
Last season he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach, Will Wade, said that the team was "scared" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“ This is what you fear all the time, ” said Wade.
A volcano spews ash on Mexico City
Ashes ejected from the Popocataptal volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned the inhabitants of Mexico on the Sabbath to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crater increased and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded over the course of 24 hours.
At the center, there were a number of noises and tremors.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash over the windshields of cars in Mexican City neighborhoods, such as Suchimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity in a volcano that is 72 km (45 km) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 earthquake rocked Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Clash between police and cutthroats. Catalans approaching the anniversary of the independence vote.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters who supported independence collided with riot police forces, and thousands joined protests to commemorate the first anniversary of the party's vote for independence of Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists who were stopped by riot cops threw eggs at the cops and sprinkled paint powder, creating black dust clouds on the streets that are usually swarming with tourists.
Conflicts also broke out later that day when police officers had to use clubs to overcome protesters.
For several hours, independent groups who sang “not forgotten, not forgiven ” stood up to those who supported the unity they called“ the long live of Spain. ”
Local press reports that 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained by protesters.
Tensions remained high in the independence-supported areas a year after the People's Question held on October 1 was tried illegally by the Spanish government, but celebrated by the Catalans who supported independence.
The voters voted largely to become an independent country, although the vote was low when those who opposed the separation mostly confiscated the vote.
Government authorities in Catalonia reported that nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the voting in polls throughout the region in violent conflicts.
Independence support groups have set up camp for a stay on Friday night to prevent national police from showing support.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different course.
Narcisse Terms, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he had lost hope of Catalonia's chance of independence.
“ Last year we had our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan Separatists won an important victory, though tight in the election last December, they found it difficult to maintain momentum this year when many of their best known leaders are in voluntary exile or prisons awaiting trial for their part in the People's Question Organization and followed by the Declaration of Independence.
Juan Foig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police support demonstration on his phone, said that the conflict was sparked by politicians on both sides of the aisle.
“ It gets worse, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriole Yonkers, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison awaiting trial since last year, announced that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
“ Reporting as candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and oppression we have witnessed from the Spanish government, ” he says.
Lundundry: Several men were arrested after a car butted in the house.
Three men -- 33 years old, 34 and 39 -- were arrested after a car head-butted several times at the blondie house.
The incident took place in Blingagarg Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m.
Investigator Bob Bloomings said the gates were damaged as well as the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point an arrow was fired from a bow to the car.
A manga kick gives Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangoers.
Dolly Manga's first goal for Livingston promised victory.
Livingstone, who had just gone to the league, shocked Rangjörs and Coach Stephen Gérard that it was only his second loss in 18 games as director of the Abrux Club.
Dolly Manga's kick meant a lot because Gary Holt's team was moving in second.
Gjörr's team remains without a win in the Super League this season, and will face lead Harts, behind which she is eight points behind next Sunday.
Before that, Ranjäres hosted Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends the lack of losses in the house to six games, and Coach Holt hasn't experienced a break since he replaced Kenny Miller in the last month.
Livingstone missed opportunities in front of a weak guest group.
Holt's group was supposed to take the lead long before they scored a goal, when their directness caused Ranjärs to have different problems.
Scott Robinson broke forward but dragged his attempts ahead of the gate, and then Alan Lethagoi could focus his efforts only later after he slipped in to meet Craig Leggett's headbutt before the gate.
The hosts were willing to allow the Ranger to play in front of them, knowing that they could make it difficult for the group to be held in free kicks.
And that was how the crucial gate took place.
The Rangers took a free kick and Livingston created an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to block Manga, who made a touch and scored a goal from the center of the floor.
At this point, the rangers controlled the ball, but found the protection of the house impregnable, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained almost unthreatening.
This pattern was drawn to the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos did force Kelly to save the gate.
Scott Pitnam was stopped at the foot of the Ranger's goalkeeper, Alan McGregor, and Leith was touched by another free kick by Levigston.
Crucifixive bullets continued to enter Livingston's floor and brake, while two penalty bullets -- after a gleaning offense on the replacement Glen Middleton, and one on a touch of the hand -- were removed.
? Amazing. ?
Alastair Lamont, BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
An amazing game and an amazing outcome from Livingston.
All the players were excellent, and continued to exceed expectations in this upward swing.
Their style of acting and staff has hardly changed since they returned to the leading position, but Holt should be given much credit for the way he's formed the team since his arrival.
He had so many stars.
Captain Holkett was awesome, leading an incredibly organized defense, while Manga kept Connor Goldson and G.J.
However, the Rangers were uninspired.
Although they were pretty good sometimes under G.R.R., they didn't live up to those standards.
They were missing the final ball - just once they opened the home team's defense - and it's a red flag for the Ranjärs, who found themselves in the middle of the field.
A reception is involved with Erdoğan Bechlan.
There were blue smiles and sky when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met on Saturday (29 September) for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - his goal was to mend the relationship between the two members of the NATO alliance.
They differed on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press, and the acceptance of Turkey into the European Union.
Erdogan then continued to participate in the opening of a new giant mosque.
Cologne is the largest Turkish city outside Turkey.
Police have announced security reasons for blocking 25,000 people from gathering at the front of the mosque, but many supporters have assembled nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdoğan - many of them as Kurds - played their voices as well, protesting both Erdoğan's policy lines and Germany's decision to welcome him in the country.
Opposite protesters reflect the controversy about the guest some of the Turks in Germany praise him as a hero and others condemn him as a tyrant.
Car accident in Deptford:
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Stwood and Evelyn, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 p.m.
The driver stopped and paramedics treated the wounded, but the male died instantly.
The collision came after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run accident on the street of Cheulder, about a mile from the accident on Saturday.
City police say cops are trying to identify the victim and notify his next of kin.
Instead of putting up roadblocks and buses on alternate roads, drivers are encouraged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in the riot
Six guards were injured in a riot in a secure prison for men, so the prison office handed over.
The riot broke out at the Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 p.m., and it still continues.
Special police from a tornado unit were brought to the scene to eliminate the riot, which includes eight prisoners and was contained in a single wing.
Guards were treated for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the Department of Corrections said: “Extraordinarily skilled prison guards have been recruited to deal with an ongoing event at Long Lartin Prison.
Six guards were treated for injuries.
We don't accept violence in our prisons, and we're clear that those involved will be handed over to the police and their sentences may be extended."
Long Lartin Prison houses 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison governor was reported to have been treated in a hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, riot cops were called into prison to deal with a major riot where prison guards were attacked with pool cues.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flash floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's expected to happen at the beginning of next week, when the remains of Hurricane Rosa will cross the southeast desert and bring them into danger of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already declared a danger to flash floods on Monday and Tuesdays for West Arizona into Southeast Nevada, Southeast California, and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
The storm, Rosa, is expected to pass a direct course over Phoenix on Tuesday, and will approach at the end of Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service has tweeted that only ten tropical cyclones have remained in the status of a tropical storm or a tropical depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The final models of the Arizona Hurricane Center view 50 to 100 millimeters of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm on the margins of the Arizona Mogulon.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central rock mountains and the large basin, are expected to receive 25 to 50 millimeters, with the possibility of isolated locations that would receive 50 millimeters.
For those outside the area who are in danger of flash floods, the rain of Storm Rosa may be a blessing because the area suffered a drought.
Although floods are a serious danger, some of these rains will be helpful because the southwest is currently suffering from drought conditions.
According to U.S. drought tracking, over 40 percent of Arizona is in a severe drought, which is the second category in its severity, so reported websiteweather.com.
First, the route of the Rosa Storm will reach land across the peninsula in Baja California, Mexico.
A Rosa storm, still at hurricane power on a Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 80 miles per hour, is 200 miles south of Punta Yoggina, Mexico, moving north at approximately 20 miles per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific, so it weakens.
Thus, it is expected to reach land in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm in the afternoon or Monday evening.
The rains across parts of Mexico can be heavy and cause strong floods.
“ Rainfalls include 75 to 150 mm expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a chance of up to 250 mm, reports Web siteweather.com.
Then the Rosa storm will continue into tropical silver Mexico before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical outlet, which will then continue across Arizona into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected of Rosa's storm, or its remains, is heavy rainfall in Baja California, Southwest Sonora, and the Southwest desert in the United States", the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are likely to cause flash floods and harmful streams of desert life and land collapses in the mountainous areas.
Assault at Midsummer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder.

A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old male were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset according to the oar.
The cops are asking anyone who may have cell phone footage of what happened, to contact the police.
Trump said Kavanaugh endured the convictions and anger of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a vote to reject the shocking rudeness and tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Cavanaugh “suffered the badness, anger ” of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment.
Cavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying strongly and emotionally the accusation of Christine Blazi Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her accusation.
The president said on Saturday that "The people of the United States saw Cavanaugh's brilliance and quality and courage" that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Cavanaugh's appointment is a vote to confirm the appointment of one of the most excellent legal minds of our time, a courtman with a record of outstanding public service," he said to his supporters in West Virginia.
The president was indirectly referring to Cavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the importance of Republicans coming to vote in the mid-term elections.
“ Five more weeks until one of the most important votes of our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but actually I am a candidate," he said.
“ That’s why I run everywhere to fight for great candidates. ”
Trump claimed that the Democrats were on a mission to “oppose and interfere. ”
A Republican executive assistant informed CNN that the first central procedural vote in the Senate's full nomination was expected to take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds are killed in an earthquake and a tsunami in Indonesia, and the number is increasing.
At least 384 people were killed, many of them washed up in huge waves crashing on the beaches, when an earthquake and a powerful tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, so official sources reported on Saturday.
Very many people gathered for a beach festival in Palo on Friday, with waves bearing about 20 feet [6 m] high, crashed on the beach at sunset, and swept many to their deaths and destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
“ When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still dealing with their affairs on the beach rather than immediately fleeing, and they were victimized, ” said Sotopo Porvo Norho, a spokesman for the BNPB Disaster Management Agency, with a briefing in G.A.A.
“ The tsunami did not arrive alone, it towed cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground, ” said Nurho, adding that the tsunami advanced over the open sea at 800 km (497 km) before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and they survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
Air footage published by the Disaster Agency has shown destruction for numerous homes and shops, crooked bridges, and crashes and mosque surrounded by water.
Subshocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The BPPT (BPPT) in Indonesia stated that the energy released in Friday's powerful quake was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to him, the geography of the city, sitting at the edge of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the tsunami.
Nurho described the destruction as "awesome" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nurho said that the number of casualties and damage could be greater along North Palo with a 300 km long coastline (190 km), an area called Dongella, and closer to the area of the earthquake.
The media “has completely collapsed, and there is no information ” from Donegala, said Nurihu.
The Red Cross stated in a statement, adding that his men and volunteers were on their way to affected areas.
“ This is a tragedy now, but it could get much worse, ” he said.
On Saturday, a lot of criticism was offered to the Agency for not announcing that a tsunami had harmed Palo, although officials said that the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In an amateur video distributed on social media, you can see a man on the roof of a building screaming hysterical warnings about a tsunami approaching people on the street below.
Within minutes a wall of water crashes on the beach, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters wasn't able to immediately verify that the photo was authentic.
The tremor and the tsunami caused massive power outages that cut off communication around Palo and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate the rescue efforts.
The military began sending transport planes with assistance from G.A.R.A.T.A. and other cities, according to the authorities, but the survivors still desperately need food and other essentials.
The city's airport was opened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Góko and his friend were scheduled to visit rescue centers in Palo on Sunday.
The death toll in Tsunami in Indonesia has climbed to over 800.
It's very difficult.
While the people of the World Vision Organization from Donegala arrived safely in Palo City, where workers sheltered in shelters made of tarps set up in their office courtyards, they passed mirrors of destruction on their way, said Mr. Dossabe.
“ They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed, ” he said.
It's very difficult.
Even as relief groups began the unfortunate procedures of disaster relief gears, some complained that they had prevented the arrival of foreign relief workers with great experience.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies, and people from other countries can only be started if the affected area is declared a national disaster zone.
This thing's not done yet.
“ It is still defined as a disaster at a district level, ” said Ulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“ After the government says, "All right, this is a national disaster," we can open the door to international aid, but that position has not yet been announced.
As the second night dawned on Palo after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, friends and family of missing persons clung to the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that illuminate the grim stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who was buried in rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Sovandunno, coach of Indonesia's paragliding team, trained two missing parachutists for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped in the hotel see, including Mr. Mandagi, were his disciples.
“ I carry my own emotional burden, ” he said.
Mr. Gandon recalls how in the hours after the news of the hotel collapse seeing a sight among the floating paratrooper community, he desperately sent the WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palo, who took part in the beach festival.
However, his messages showed only one gray sign of criticism, instead of a pair of blue markings.
“ I think it means that the messages were not delivered, ” he said.
Thieves took $26,750 during a Newport on the View.
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $26,750 from a Brinks employee who filled an ATM at Newport on the Leeve, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver emptied an ATM at the entertainment complex and prepared to bring more money, author Dennis McCarthy wrote in a message.
While busy, another man ran behind a Brinks employee and stole a bag of cash to fill an ATM.
A witness saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the police, but the police did not detail how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information regarding their identity is asked to contact Newport PD on phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West:
The rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
In announcing the change in Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "The entity known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used the nickname as his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes first on the television show "Saturday Night Live", where it is expected to launch its new album, "Yandhi".
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande who canceled her participation because of “emotional reasons, ” said the designer of the program.
In addition to shortening his current professional name, West once said that word had religious significance for him.
"I think 'yee' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible the word means you'", West said earlier this year, when he talked about his album name with the radio host Big Boy.
“ So I am you, I am we, it is we.
It's gone from Kanye, which means the one and only thing, to just an idea of the good in us, the evil in us, or the confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He's one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Coombs was otherwise known as Puff Daddy, P. Daddy or Didi, but this year he announced that he preferred the names ? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
A former partner of West, J. Z., also passed through versions of his name with no hyphen and uppercase letters.
The president of Mexico pledged not to use the military against civilians.
The president-elect of Mexico, Anders Manuel Lopes Overdoor, pledged never to use military force against civilians, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody oppression against students.
Lopes Overdoor promised on Saturday in the square of Sholko “never to use the army to oppress the Mexican people.
Military forces fired on a nonviolent demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
Lopes Overdoor pledged to support young Mexicans by providing financial support for those who study and open more public universities for free.
He said unemployment and lack of education are pushing young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funding of artificial intelligence.
As China's activities increase in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it invests in research in the field, so says the researcher who deals in the A.I. Kai-Po Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His words come after various parts of the U.S. government have issued statements about artificial intelligence, even while the U.S. government has no official artificial intelligence strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its program last year: it strives to be number one in artificial intelligence by the year 2030.
“ Multiplying the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we're looking for the next breakthrough in the AI field, ” he told me.
Multiplies funding can double the odds that the next major AI would be achieved in the United States, telling me to network CNBC in this week's interview.
To me, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Organization" was published this month by the New World Organization, which invested in the most prominent artificial intelligence company in China.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the first-class member of the United States, and later served as senior director of Microsoft Research and President of the Google branch in China.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Agency Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects, and asked when you would be next to help identify the following visionaries.
Investigators in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, told me.
“ It's not China that takes our top researchers at the academy, it's the business companies that are doing it, ” he told me.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited stars from universities in recent years to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said that also changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think a green card should automatically be offered to a PhD in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published its AI program for the next generation.
The Chinese National Natural Science Fund gives funding to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Fund for National Science and Other Government Organizations is appropriations for researchers in the United States, but the academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center designed to involve partners from the industry and from the academy, and the White House announced a special committee for artificial intelligence.
The month announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
As for the NSF, she is currently investing over $100 million a year in research in artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Legislative Initiative to create a National Security Committee for Artificial Intelligence has been inactive for months.
People of Macedonia are pointing out a referendum with the question of whether to change the name of the country.
On Sunday, Macedonians vote with a referendum on whether to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which will resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that prevented it from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in which there is a province called Macedonia, claims that its neighbor's name is a claim to the territory of Greece and vetoed it to join NATO and the European Union.
Both countries signed a deal based on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would damage the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population in Macedonia.
President George ‘ Ivanov said that he would not vote on the referendum and the banning campaign cast doubt on whether the voters would meet the minimum amount of 50% to make the referendum valid.
The question in the ballot is this: "Are you in favor of joining NATO and the European Union with the agreement with Greece?"
Those who support the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zhiev, claim it's a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the states created by the disbanding of Yugoslavia, can join the bodies like the European Union and NATO.
"I came today to point out the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they could live free under the European Union umbrella, because it meant a protected life for all of us," said Olivera G. George, 79-year-old Zizbekah in Scope.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough MPs have said that they will comply with the vote to make it permanent.
To change the name, it would take a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election board said there were no irregularities at 1300 hours.
However, the voter was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last election to Parliament in 2016, where 66 percent of voters came to vote.
"I've come to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said the 62-year-old José Tanowski, a voter in the capital of Skupia.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zayev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko are ruling out their ballot in Stromiza, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, in the Macedonian referendum for changing the name of the state, which opened the door to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the House of Parliament in Scoopia, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardrkov prepared a small platform and chairs in front of tents that confiscated the referendum.
“ We're all for NATO and the European Union, but we want to join us head-on, not through the servants' entrance, ” said Kavardrkov.
“ We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of a European Union."
Prime Minister Zhiev said that NATO companies would bring the most necessary investments to Macedonia, where unemployment exceeds 20%.
“ I believe the vast majority will be in favor of over 80 percent of our citizens supporting the European Union and NATO, ” said Zeev after voting.
He said that a positive outcome would be “the security of our future. ”
A survey published on Monday at the Macedonian Policy Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum – less than the required percentage of participation.
Another poll, conducted by the Telma TV network, found that 57 of the responders were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to succeed, the voter percentage has to be at least 50% plus one.
Failure of the referendum will be the first significant loss of pro-West government policy since it seized power in May last year.
Video: A Man of Manchester City, Sergio Aguaro, navigates through all of Brighton's defense to score a goal.
Sergio Aguaro and the Sterling Rahim broke out Brighton's defense in the 2-0 victory of Manchester City on Saturday at Ithyad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed that Aguero had easily conquered the gate.
The Argentine pioneer received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defense players, before he broke into the open field.
At this point, Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one shield before running for a few extra shields on the Brighton border.
Then he kicked a pass to the left, and found Sterling.
The English striker used his first touch on the floor to hand the ball back to Aguaro, who kicked his right foot in defeating Brighton's goalkeeper, Mateo Ryan, with a bullet to the right side of the net.
“ Aguero is suffering from foot problems, ” said the director of Manchester City for reporters.
“ We agreed that he would play for about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the sky’s contents the initial advantage of rivalries in the major league.
This gate arrived at the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's territory during this.
He sent a great cross ball along the right flank to Leroy Sanne.
Sanne dredged the ball before leading Sterling towards the far beam.

On Tuesday at 12:55 P.M., he will face Oppenheim at Rain Necker Stadium in Zansheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play spoiler with the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was no good reason to force another start.
But Schermer, who is very competitive, hopes to win Sunday against Colorado Rockys, but only if there are still consequences for the playoffs for the Rockies, leading one game on Los Angeles Dodge in the NL West League.
The Rockies have booked at least an open ticket spot with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but have not yet promised themselves first place in the house.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can be able to play with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver with the viewers and the other team will probably play at the highest level at any point that I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to face it?"
The Nationals have yet to announce the starter for Sunday, but reports say they tend to let the Cesar serve in such a condition.
Charzer, let this be the beginning of his number 34, has been training in Boulpan on Thursday and will serve on his day of rest - Sunday.
Washington's right-hand pitcher has a record of 18-7 with the ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikes in 220 rounds of 2/3 this season.
Trump. There's a rally in West Virginia.
The president indirectly implied the situation around his chosen candidate for Supreme Court Bert Cavanaugh, as he talked about the importance of Republicans coming to vote in the mid-term elections.
“ Everything we did is at stake in November.
Five more weeks for the most important election of our lives.
It's one of the most, most -- I don't run, but actually I do run, which is why I'm running all over the place fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, “You see this horrible group of extremist Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And if determined to take back the power by any means necessary, you see the wickedness, the contempt.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that's what they want is power and control, we're not gonna give it to them."
The Democrats are, he says, on a mission to “oppose and interfere. ”
“ And you see it during the last four days, ” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and vicious and despicable and dishonest.
He mentioned in her name the minority leader of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which led to booing levels from the audience.
“ Remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Oh, uh, whatever.
No, uh no, I waited until -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a pluralist place.
She can't stand those who express their opinion.
When momentum activists at my local party office voted to censor me, it wasn't much of a surprise.
After all, I am the last in the line of Labour MPs to be told they are not wanted - and only because we have expressed our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, J.V. Ryan, was treated the same way because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the decision to censor me paid me a visit for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, to Europe - to most irony, issues similar to those that G.J. did not agree with previous party leaders.
The East Nottingham Liber meeting on Friday said, "We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour parliamentary member, the general committee meetings on Friday nights were just like that.
Today's step is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of politics “more kind, gentler, ” long forgotten, if ever began.
It becomes increasingly evident that the Labour Party has no tolerance for different views, and any opinion is judged by its leadership of the party.
This situation began shortly after Jeremy was elected head of the party, when colleagues I once thought we shared a similar political view, began to expect him to make a U-turn and take positions that I would otherwise never agree to - whether it was national security or one European market.
Every time I speak in public -- and it doesn't really matter what I say -- immediately comes an abusive flood of reproof on social media with calls for impeachment, condemning the politics of the center and calling that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm a lot luckier than my colleagues, because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I'm touched by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of racial abuse every day but never back down.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse became commonplace.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're already in the same pluralistic place, and with every "no confidence" decision or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes more trouble.
Over the past two years, many have advised me to keep my mouth shut, not to be so loud, and then I will “be fine. ”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, the neglect of the Thatcher government has caused my public school class to nearly fall apart, looking for how to fight better social services for those who need them — whether as a local council member or a minister of the government.
I never hid my politics, including the last election.
No man in East Nottingham could be confused as to my political positions and issues with my current leadership.
For those of you who promoted the decision on Friday, all I have to say is that while the country is crawling towards Berkezite who will hurt our families, our businesses and our public service, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour leader.
But to be honest, the one message I have is not for the momentum movement in Nottingham, but for my constituents, whether they are Labour's members or not: I'm proud to serve you and I guarantee that no amount of threats of impeachment or political usefulness will deter me from acting in a way that I believe serves most of all your interests.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Air to the summit
Last two fresh ones tipped the final score a little bit, but surely Air deserves a win in today's wonderfully entertaining Scottish major leagues.
They are now at the top of the chart, the only unbeatable side of the decade.
In the end, it was their better defense, as well as taking much more risks, that played for the good of the home team, and Coach Peter Morchett had every reason to be pleased.
“ We have been tested in our games so far, and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of the Melrose Group said: "Ira deserves all the credit. They took better risks than we did."
==Plot==Trey of Grant Anderson at the 14th minute, converted by Fraser Klemmo, placed Eyre in the lead position, but a yellow ticket for Scotland player Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to score points and Jason Batgott to catch Trey who was not Homer.
Clemo took Air's lead with a foul, before he actually half-timed, he scored and then converted Trey Solo to get 17-5 to the air in half.
But Melrose opened the second half well and Patrick Angerson's Trey, which was converted by Batgot, has narrowed it down to five points.
After that, there was a long delay due to a severe injury by Rodrich Knut, taken away on the stretcher, and starting with the game's renewal, Ira increased the gap through the Tray of Stafford McDowell, which was converted by Clemo.
The Acting Captain of Air Blair McPherson then took a yellow card, and again Melrose took advantage of the other man with Trey who wasn't Bruce Colvin's Homer, at the end of a massive series of pressure.
But the home group recovered, and when Straun Hatchinson received a yellow card for assaulting Clemo without a bullet, from the foul line, McPherson scored a touchdown) down behind the progressive mole of Air.
Kalimo Hamir, as he did again almost back in the game, after Kyle Roy Haas kicked David Armstrong's punch and sent the Henry Germ wing to the sixth Trey of the home team.
Star Still Game seems ready for a new restaurant career
Star Still Game, Ford Kiernan, seemed ready to move to the restaurant industry after it was discovered that he was listed as the director of a restaurant company on the license.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of J.K. Jarvis on the BBC' popular show, which he writes, starring with his old comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season would be the final season of the show, and Kiernan seemed to be planning life after Cryling.
According to the official records, he is the director of Adriptmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although Scottish Sun's source suggested that Kiernan was looking for ways to get into the booming restaurant business in Glasgow.
The sea is ours.
Sailors patrol the Naval Command, cloaked in ships in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a blue-sea flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon carry the password: "The sea is ours by right.
It is our duty to reclaim it."
All over Bolivia that cannot be found for the sea, the memory of a shoreline that was lost in favor of Chila in a bloody conflict over 19th century resources, still alive - as well as the yearning to sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes may be at their peak for decades, while Bolivia waits for the international court's decision on October 1 after five years of debate.
“ Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and, of course, it expects a positive attitude to come, ” said Roberto Calzazila, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will fortify the international court's decision on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Judges in the Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia’s demand that after decades of fragmented calls, C.I.A. will be obliged to negotiate a sovereign approach to Bolivia.
The charismatic native president of Bolivia, Eva Morales, who faced a controversial re-election battle next year, hangs a lot of decision on Monday.
“ We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean, ” he promised at the end of August.
But commentators think there's not much chance that the court will decide for Bolivia -- and that even if it decides for its own good, it won't make much difference.
The U.N. Court in The Hague has no authority to grant the territory of Chile, stating that it will not determine the results of possible calls.
The fact that the decision of the International Court came only six weeks after hearing the closing arguments indicates that the case “was not complex, ” but Paz Zarata, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivian claims, the last four years may have weakened them.
"The issue of access to the sea was hijacked by the current government in Bolivia," said Zarata.
Morales' war rhetoric destroyed every last shred of good faith on the part of Chile, she said.
At some point Bolivia and Chile will keep talking, but it'll be very difficult to have discussions after that.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The previous president, Eduardo Rodriguez Veltza, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "a great opportunity to start a new era in a relationship with Chile" and the chance to“ end 139 years of controversy in favor of both sides," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - uses the marine theme as political leverage.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, ” he added.
"Stopping is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says that nuclear damage will not occur unless she can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jung said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it couldn't trust Washington.
Ree spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called the U.S. to keep the promises he made during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two rival states.
His words arrive as the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompeo, is on the verge of reopening diplomatic contacts on nuclear weapons that have reached an impasse more than three months after Singapore's summit with North Korea's leader, Kim Jjong On.
Ree said it was a pipe dream to think that continuing U.S. sanctions and resistance to declare the end of the Korean War would force North Korea to kneel.
The United States is afraid to accept an announcement without North Korea taking significant steps first to disarmament.
Both Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, are interested in a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that North Korea is serious about giving up its nuclear arsenal, where it is likely to see the only way to protect its safety.
Pompo plans to visit Pyongyang next month for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
A fashion show in Paris reveals the new trend in giant hats on its way to luxury stores everywhere.
We'll find the solution for anyone who wants to expand the hat collection or get complete protection from the sun.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown uncovered a series of huge, crazy headdresses for their SS19 collection in a fashion show that stunned the fashion scene at Fashion Week in Paris.
Unproductive hats completely conquered Instagram this summer, and these designers brought their extraordinary works to the fashion show track.
Valentino’s prominent item was a beige overcoated hat in broad, feather-like margins that covered the heads of models.
Other broken-down props included decorated watermelons, a magic hat and even pineapple -- but they weren't designed to protect the head from the cold.
Tom Brown also revealed a selection of strange masks - check in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks included tailored lips and more blood for Hannibal Lecter than for Hut Kutur.
One piece mentioned a diving mask including snorkel and glasses, and another one looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And those who want to continue with a huge fashion statement of dimensions, their time has come.
Fashion commentators predict that the giant fedoras make their way to the high-end stores everywhere.
The giant hats are the next hit after the bomba : the two-foot straw hat that is observed on everyone's head, from Mariana to Emily Ratikowski.
The kelt label behind the very impractical hat that flooded social networks produced another large piece on the track -- a beach bag almost as big as the one of the swimsuit model who carried it.
The drop-off bag was burned, with the margins of threads and a white leather handle, the most prominent item in the SS19 collection of "Clean Le Riviera" at Fashion Week in Paris.
A celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I predict that big hats and big sea bags will reach the luxury stores next summer because design has made a huge impression and it will be hard to ignore the demand for exosoriz.
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the people of the world
The independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and it continues in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, which are supported by personal success and team in sports, art, music, and other fields in the community.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to give the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, a career where they will be chosen and placed as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and assimilating a custom curriculum, we find that modern languages continue to accumulate popularity as a school requirement.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in a language they understand, it gets into their head.
If you talk to a man in his own language, it gets into his heart."
It's an important reminder that we can't rely only on English when we want to build connections and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest test results of this year, you can see that languages are at the top of charts with the highest success rate in independent schools.
A total rate of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students scored high in Mandarin, and 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish.
These figures show that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and teenagers will no doubt need in the future.
Today, the area of language as a matter of choice is considered to be the same level as stEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the British Employment and Skills Council found that, among the reasons that employers mentioned Cody to fill single jobs, 17 percent were attributed to lack of language skills.
Thus, to a growing degree, language skills become essential to preparing students for future careers.
Given the rise in language requirements for future job opportunities, these skills are essential in the world of globalization.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he learns a second language, he will have a significant advantage in the future because of this lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries is automatically positioned in a position of advantage over competitors.
According to a survey of YouGov that included more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language on a level of conversation, and French was the only language in which there was a two-digit number of speakers, 15 percent.
That is why it is important to invest in teaching children languages today.
Knowledge of many languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Inside Scotland, each school would be different about languages being taught.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will learn languages that are considered the most important for Britain by looking forward to the 21st century, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what the child's interest, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from indie schools, with a team of teachers who specialize in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are obliged to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills it takes to succeed, in any predictable future.
There is no denying today, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, so this should be evident in education.
Yes, modern languages should be viewed as “international communication skills. ”
Independent schools will continue to offer these levels of choice, diversity and excellence to the children of Scotland.
It's the order of the hour.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools
LeBron is expected to play for the first time in the Laker uniform on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait ended for fans who were waiting to see LeBron James play for the first time in the Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker coach Luke Walton announced that James would play the preseason game against the Denver Nets on Sunday in San Diego.
But we haven't determined how many minutes he'll play.
“ It will be more than one and less than 48, ” was written on the Lakers' official website.
Laker writer Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six preseason Laker games.
“ At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare, ” he said.
Trump rally time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a flood of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, the Virginia system.
This is the first of five scheduled Trump rallies this week, including stops at friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While you've voted his approval for the Supreme Court judge, Trump is striving to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections, because the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight, and how is it available on the Internet?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 1900 Eastern Standard Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's rally in West Virginia can be watched on the Internet with a direct stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely address this week's hearings as Supreme Court nominee Burt Cavanaugh, and have become tensions about sexual misconduct charges, resulting in the delaying of the Senate vote in the week while the FBI investigates the charges.
But the main goal of this flood of rallies is to help Republicans who face challenging elections in November to get some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that the purpose of these five rallies next week is “to motivate volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority that they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, ” according to Reuters.
“ Congressional control is so critical to its ego that the president is willing to visit as many countries as possible with the entrance to the crowded election season, ” he told Ritter, a spokesman for Trump's campaign who sought to remain anonymous.
Tonight's rally, scheduled to take place at Wesbanko Stadium in Wheeling, can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and pull press coverage from the Pittsburgh media, estimated by West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, where he has won over 40 points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to St. West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, who is behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should come to try to improve his position in the polls," said Simon Hader, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Royter.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team shows a willing struggle to maintain hope for Sunday's individual games
After three one-sided sessions, the Sunday afternoon fours are perhaps exactly what the Raider Cup needs.
Momentum's propulsion pendulum is a totally made-up sports concept, but the players really believe in it, and never more than in competitions like this.
So where do they think momentum is now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now he's four, so you can see it as a little momentum," said G.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points ahead with 12 more in the game.
However, the Americans, as Sepith says, feel that they have a bit of wind in sails, and have a lot to cheer up about, not the last of them in the form of ‘ Seppia ’ and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each one of them plays three points out of four.
Sepith was deadly from the Hetty to the Green, leading in a personal example.
The cries of joy grew stronger as his round continued, as he sank critical Pat to win the game four all-square and Thomas dropped two after two.
His Pat who won the game 15on won a similar cry, the kind that shows that he believes the American team still has hope.
"You really only have to dig deep and worry about your own game," said Sepith.
That's all any of these players have left to do.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than a threshold) and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed lead story of the Ryder Cup.
The odd, yet charming pair of Europeans are four out of four and all sympathetic.
"Mollywood" was the only pair that didn't hit the device on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
The same rotation, and the way their energy seems to flow to the enthusiastic audience and from it, establishes the fact that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and will not be a more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to sign the European potential victory with the sun set on the golf course of Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is early to talk about European glory.
Boba and Watson Webb Simpson finished with Serge ‘ Hugh Garcia, hero of the four balls of the morning, when he robbed you with Alex Norén.
Boggy and two doubles in the front nine dropped the Spaniards and Swedes into a hole they never got close to coming out of.
However, on Sunday there is no one to help you get out of the hole.
It's fascinating to take a closer look at the four balls and fours because of the interactions between the pair, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has led significantly towards the last day, but this fourth session has shown that the American team is filled with a spirit of battle that some, especially within the United States, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 towards the Ryder Cup's last day.
Europe is in a healthy lead for the last day of the Ryder Cup after completing the four ball and four games on Saturday with a 10-6 score against the United States.
Inspirational duo Tommy Fleetwood and Lorenzo Molinari led the change with two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods, and raised the gap so far at Le Wolf National for four points.
The European side players of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to protect the trophy they lost in Hazeltin two years ago, ruled against the Americans who missed the four-ball games this morning and brought the series to 3-1.
The American players have shown greater resistance in the four games, and have won two games, but have not been able to close the gap.
In order to keep the cup, the members of J.F.R.E.
Fleetwood is the first European to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who have been nicknamed "Mollywood" after an extraordinary weekend, are just the second team to win four points from their four opening games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball games, they continued a remarkable harmony together to defeat the weakened Woods and American rookie Bryson DeChambau with an even greater result of 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself across two games on Saturday, exhibited random bursts of excellence, but so far he's lost 19 out of the 29 games of the four balls and fours, and seven games in a row.
==Background==Stin Rose, who rested during the morning's four-ball games, returned to join Henrik Stanson in the four-games to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koopka, who are ranked first and third in the world.
However, not everything went easily to the European players in the pleasant weather and the breeze that had been inhabited southwest of Paris.
The three-time outstanding winner, GJ, and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a push-over win for John Ram of Spain and Ian Poulter in the four-ball games and later returned to defeat Fletcher and Rory MacLeroy 4 and 3 in the four games, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup Group have returned from a negative four-point gap to the individual games, although as holders of the Cup, the people of Forrick need only a tie to keep the Cup.
However, after standing second for two days, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their ability.
North Korea says that "No way"
The North Korean Foreign Minister announced on Saturday at the UN that the continued sanctions deepened her distrust of the United States and that there is no way the state would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under these circumstances.
Ri Yeung Ho announced at the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken “a significant goodwill ” during the past year, such as stopping nuclear missile trials, dismantling the nuclear testing site, and a commitment not to develop any more nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we see no matching response from the United States," he said.
“ Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national defenses and conditions like this under any circumstances, under no circumstances will we disband ourselves first unilaterally from nuclear weapons."
While Sherry repeated the known complaints of North Korea about the U.S. opposition to nuclear disarmament, which North Korea had done would be rewarded in order to take progressive steps, it seemed important that it did not reject nuclear disarmament, as it had done in the past.
Ree referred to a joint announcement made by Kim G. G. and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim pledged to act for the nuclear decomposition of the Korean Peninsula while Trump promised to protect North Korea's safety.
North Korea requested an official end to the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but the U.S. said North Korea had to give up its nuclear weapons first.
The United States also opposed calls to reduce international sanctions on North Korea.
“ The United States insists on nuclear disarmament first and increases sanction pressure to achieve its goal in a way of coercion, even resisting the “declare of the end of the war, ” said Ri.
“ The idea that sanctions can make us kneel is a dream of people who are ignorant about us.
But the problem is, the worsening sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ree never mentioned any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the President of the United States emphasized in his speech at the U.N. earlier this week.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, in the last five months, adding: “If the other side of the nuclear dissolution issue was South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear dissolution of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a dead end.
However, Rie's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the attack on North Korea's missiles was inevitable after Mr. President Trump called Kim "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened the total destruction of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarmament, but said there was still a lot of work to do and that sanctions must remain intact until North Korea's nuclear decomposition.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a specific time frame for it, adding that, "If it takes two, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claimed that the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for actions taken.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompau, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue decisively and unbridled until we achieve complete and final nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding of its ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompao met Ri at the margins of the General Assembly of the United Nations and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare the next summit.
Pompo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left A Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for placing “the demands of a gangster. ”
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear device, if the U.S. were to take “compliant measures. ”
He said that Kim told him that "the appropriate steps" he wanted included security guarantees that Trump had committed in Singapore, as well as changes in the normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course in how to get enough rest.
A new class at Harvard University this year teaches participants how to sleep more, trying to fight the growing Mac culture of learning by staying up all night with caffeine.
An academic study found that students at the number one university in the world often have no idea about the basic principles of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Xysler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham Weimans Hospital, designed the course, which he believes to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to open the course after a lecture that he gave about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
“ At the end of the talk, one girl came up to me and said: © Why am I being told this just now, in my senior year?
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleeping - what surprised me, he said to the Telegraph newspaper.
The course, for the first time this year, explains to students the principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performances, as well as improve their overall condition.
Paul Brierier, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a senior health director at the university, said that the university decided to open the course after discovering that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a dorm room, where students press coffee mugs, curtains, sports clothes and books -- to get explanations for the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performances are influenced by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of a sleepless routine.
In another part, participants are told how persistent sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, if interactive symbols, are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“ We know that this will not change the behavior of students overnight.
But we think they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know the effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Professor .
He said that pride culture on sleepless nights still exists, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students cause the problem of sleep deprivation growing.
Caring for adequate sleep, and good sleep quality, should be the secret weapon of every student to fight stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation puts the brain to starvation, so we are hungry all the time.
Raymond Sue, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Zeisler design the course after attending one of his first classes at Harvard.
He said that the course lit up his eyes and moved him to encourage a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar teaching program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Seisel recommended that students look at the possibility of setting a clock when it was time to go to bed, and not just when it was time to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light, which emit electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt the tempo of the hairline and thus cause problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Range: Gate of decisive manga to Gérard's players
The Rangers suffered another loss in an away game when Dolly Manga caused Steven G. G. Gerard's rebel players to defeat 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ablerocks players hoped to win their first game since the 1-4th victory at St. Johnston's, but Gary Holt's team lost only two in 18 games as manager and left the team behind eight points after the Scottish League.
Manga attacked seven minutes before halftime, and the uninspired Rangers did not appear to be equal.
While the RANGJERS now drop to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place and immediately after the Hybrine by gate.
And he may be waiting for another double Ranjäres after Kwon Callum Spence needed treatment for a head injury after an object was probably thrown at him from the balcony.
Gerard made eight exchanges in a group that passed Air to the semifinals in the Cup in Tepard.
Holt, on the other hand, came up with those 11 Livingston players who took a point from Harts last week, and he could be satisfied with the way his players tackled his opponents in any situation.
The Rangers may have controlled the ball, but Livingstone did more with the bullet that they had.
They almost scored in the second minute when Manga sent Scott Patman a ball that kicked Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder kicked the ball too far.
Then a deep free kick by Keegan G. J. Cobb found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lagoi could only kick out of the beam.
The Rangers did take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last trimester.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he had to rule in favor of a felony after a quarter-hour game, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Stephen Thömson swung against the Colombian actor's advances.
The Rangers only managed to kick twice to the goal in the first half, but the goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily stopped the headbutt of Sana Colibali and the weak kick of Obi-Ageria.
While Livingston's opening in the 34th minute was contrary to how the game was played, no one would deny that they deserved it at least for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed to deal with a deep free ball of Jacobs.
Scott Artfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball on to Scott Robinson, who remained calm in moving him to Manga to a simple conclusion.
Gerard did an act in half when he replaced Colibeli with Rain Kent, and the exchange resulted in an immediate impact almost when the extreme/wing put a bullet in Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingstone continued to force the visiting team to play exactly the kind of game they liked, with Leith ‘ Goy and Hellcat ’ continuing to send long balls.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the other stages, but McGregor stood up well to prevent Jacobs' attempt before he was headbutted from the corner.
The substitute actor Glenn Middleton later made another claim against Jacobs, but Thomson ignored again.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger counter
And now to stand by the widow of Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and continue... the day in which future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geyer developed a method that could detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the device has become a pillar of science, but in 1950 it has also become a pillar of pop culture because of the film "Bells of Coronado," where Roy Rogue and Dale Evans starred as two strange cowboys/scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that thing?"
ROSS: “This is a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put on the headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the radioactivity on the atoms in the minerals."
Evans: "Man, it's really popping now!"
He died in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see" cancer cells
A new vaccine for cancer can teach the immune system to “see ” cancer cells and eliminate them
Inoculation teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells as part of a treatment.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, and changing the cells in the lab
Then the cells can see a protein that is shared by many types of cancer and then injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
In one woman treated with a vaccine, which teaches the immune system to detect cancer cells, ovarian cancer disappears for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing cells in the lab so that they can “see ” a protein called her2 that is common to many cancers, and then injecting the cells back into the patient.
Professor J. Barzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute of the United States in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
Her2 “starts the development of several types of cancers, ” including breast cancer, ovaries, viscera, and colon, explains Professor ‘ Brasofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and teaching them how to attack cancer cells was successful in treating the type of leukemia.

Kanye West booed the studio during a confused show on the Saturday Night Live, praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he'd run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song on the program, called "Gust Town", which in the course of his performance was wearing a Make America Great hat, he began a reproof speech against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"So many times I talk to white people who say, "How can you love Trump, is he racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL episode began with a sketch starring Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star ridiculed Burt Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, as to allegations of sexual assault raised by Christine Blazi Ford.
Although the debate speech was not broadcast on the show, it was put on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to roll on West in advertising.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had been criticized behind the scenes about the hat he was wearing.
“ They attacked me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out on the stage with that hat on your head."
They attacked me!
And then they said I was in a dark place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the dark place?" He said, "He's wearing my Superman hat, because that means no one can tell me what to do.
Try to show love."
His words were booed at least twice by the audience, and it seemed that members of the S.N.L. team were embarrassed, Variety reported, and one of them said to the newspaper: "Silence of the abyss fell in the entire studio."
West was assigned to the show as a last-minute replacement instead of singer Ariana Grande, whose former partner, Mac Miller, died just days before that.
West Hamm many when he performed the song I love it dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was backed by the conservative head of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for not giving in to the crowd.
But the host of the current events program Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West simply “be who he is and that's absolutely wonderful. ”
“ But I chose not to reward (by purchasing his music or clothing or supporting his "art"), which I believe is an effort and a propagate of ideology that damages my community.
He's free.
And so did we." She added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that from now on he was “the entity formerly known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Papi and P Didi.
Another rapper, Snoop Doc, held the name Sanoff Lyon, and, of course, the famous musician Prince changed his name to sergeant and then to artist formerly known as Prince.

The star of Game of Thrones, Keith Harrington, attacks the toxic virility
Kit Harrinton is known for playing Jon Snow as a sword swinger from the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often convey to young children the message that they must be tough to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Keith said that he thought that "Something went wrong") and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married another star at Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31 years old, admitted to being very upset about handling this issue.
“ Personally, I feel very upset right now — where did we go wrong about manhood?
“ What do we teach men during their growth, from the point of view of the problem we are witnessing now?"
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic manhood because of the very masculine characters it presents.
He continued: “What comes from within, and what will we learn from outside?
What do we learn from TV, and on the street, that makes young kids feel they have to be on this particular side of being a man?
I think that's really one of the great questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because surely something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview, he admitted that he would not participate in any series of sequels or derivatives of Game of Thrones after the end of the series next summer, saying that he had “done with battlefields and horses.
From November on, Keith will be starring in a remake of Sam Shepard's play of a true Western film producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently discovered that he saw meeting his wife Rose as the best thing that ever happened as a result of Game of Thrones.
“ I knew my wife on the show, so the show gave me my future family and my life from then on, ” he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The two married in June 2018 at the Leslie residence in Scotland.
HIV/ AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases.
China declared a 14% leap in its population that lived with HlV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have the disease, thus providing official health factors.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
The great majority of new cases have been infected by sex, which is a change compared to the past.
So far, HlV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HlV thus reduced to almost zero, according to officials in China at a conference in Yunnan County.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HlV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Hiv infection as a result of sexual intercourse is a burning problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality ceased to be against the law in China in 1997, but it was said that the discrimination against the LGBT people was broad.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70 to 90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of infection are the result of not using enough protection for these sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HlV drugs as part of an effort to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her team leaked information about a Republican senator and condemns the "hazard lies" and "conspiracy theories"
American Senator Maxine Waters dropped the charges on Saturday that a member of her team posted personal information about three American senators on the senators' Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic senator from Los Angeles estimated that claims were spread by Web sites and visitors to “the right. ”
“ Lies, lies, and more vile lies, ” said Waters on Twitter.
According to reports, the information that was released included the homes and phone numbers of American Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, and was released by an unknown man on Capitol Hill during the Senate Committee hearing on sexual misconduct charges against Supreme Court candidate Burt Cavanaugh.
The leak took place some time after the three senators asked Cavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Fundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was linked to Waters' office and released the information on a member of Waters' team, according to the report of the Hill.
“ This baseless accusation is completely wrong and a complete lie, ” Waters added.
“ A member of my team — whose identity and personal details were revealed and his safety were affected by false accusations and errors — was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless accusation is completely wrong and a total lie."
Waters' announcement quickly attracted Internet criticism, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“ It is an angry denial, ” wrote Fleischer.
“ This indicates that she does not have the temperament required by members of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't react with anger.
He can't react defiantly.
He can't question the accuser's motives.
He must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the Democratic review of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused of being overly angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who's trying to beat Waters in the mid-term election, also tweeted his thoughts.
"Great if it's true," he tweeted.
In her announcement, Waters said that her office “turned to the appropriate authorities and law enforcement officials for these false claims.
“ We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered, ” she continues, “and that they will stand trial for all their destructive and dangerous acts toward my crew members.
? Johnny English 3.0 ? - A weakened spy parody starring Rowan Atkinson
It is now common to look for meanings in any new film with a British perspective, and it does seem appropriate for the resurrection of this action-comedy parody in the "G" series, which began somewhere in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English.
Would an ironic self-slap about how worthless we are turn into our country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the wide-eyed English man with the wide eyes and the rubber face was given a second chance to spoil things — and his name symbolizes more than anything — a wide comedy piece designed for film viewers in non-English countries.
Of course, he's the stupid English agent, who, despite his bizarre appearance of slippery glamour looks a little bit like Clouseau, little bit of Mr Bean and plenty of this guy who donates a single note to the music of the fire chariots in the opening text of the London Olympics in 2012.
It is also based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson played in the forgotten television commercials for Barclaycard, leaving chaos behind.
There's one or two nice minutes in the last edition of J. English.
I liked the part where Johnny English approaches the helicopter wearing a medieval armor suit, and the propeller blades ring for moments on his helmet.
Atkinson exhibits his comical physical abilities, but humor feels strangely weak and unnecessary, especially since the serious type of spy films such as 007 and an impossible task themselves now includes a comedy component.
Humor feels like he's addressing children instead of adults, and for me, the crazy adventures of G.I. English are less brilliant and focused on the silent movie jokes of Mr. Bean.
The plot of the film begins when great danger threatens Britain.
A computer hacker infiltrated the Super-Secret Internet network of British espionage, exposing the identities of all British agents in the field to the anxiety of the lead agent -- unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the final straw for an arrogant, battle-tested Prime Minister who's already suffering a complete breakdown of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best to fulfill the Teresa May role, but she doesn't have much to work with from the script.
Her intelligence consultants inform her that since every active spy has been exposed, she'll have to bring someone back from retirement.
And that means Rabbinic English in the flesh, who is now employed as principal of a prestigious school, but who gives informal lessons in how to be an undercover spy: some good jokes here, when English offers an academy for school-style .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former assistant to M.D. Misery Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Boof is now a man married to U-boat headquarters, in the role of an annoying class queen, on which Vicodin is slightly wasted.
So Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's secret service into a terrible mess are back on, with Pam Patel in front of them beautiful Ophelia Bolotova playing Olga Korilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously captive under the charms of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems - the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bouff begin with their own Odyssey, which is more of a farce of two clowns: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant; they create an outrage when they smuggle themselves into Volta's fancy yacht; and English is a total anarchy arsonist in his attempt to use a virtual reality scheme to learn the inner structure of Volta's house.
No doubt all efforts are made to lead to the final sequence, but despite the kindness and playfulness, it feels like children's television.
Pretty mediocre level.
And like the other English films, I couldn't help but think: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that she's preparing a plan for the British to work four days a week but get paid for five days
The Labour Party of J.R.M. Corbin considers a revolutionary plan that the British will work four days a week but will be paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants the company managers to move savings as a result of the AI revolution to workers in the form of another day of rest.
I mean, the employees will have a three-day weekend, and they'll still get the same salary.
Sources said that the idea would fit the company’s economic agenda and plans to divert the country to the benefit of the workers.
The Union Union Congress supports moving to a four-day work week as a way that workers can enjoy the changes in economics.
A senior Labour party source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“ It won’t happen overnight, but a four - day work week is a quest that matches the party’s approach to rebalance the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea. The Green Party called for a four-day work week during its general campaign in 2017.
However, ambition is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four - day work week is not a party policy and the party does not consider it."
The Labour candidate for Minister of Finance, John McDonnell, used the party conference last week to formulate his vision for a socialist economic revolution.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to take back power from ‘ faceless executives ’ and ‘ price raiders ’ in service companies.
The candidate’s plans for the Treasury Minister also indicate that current shareholders of water companies may not get their full investment back because the Labour government may make a low on the basis of bad behavior.
It also confirms that there are plans to bring workers to the board of companies and create 8% of the total funds to transfer 10 percent of the private sector's capital to employees, which will pocket dividends up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy told the TV show "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation into Cavanaugh changed their minds.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Burt Cavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court in at least a week, raising the question of whether the investigation could convince any of the Republicans to withdraw his support.
On Sunday’s "60 Minutes", reporter Scott Pelley asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina party companion.
“ That is, of course, ” said Kennedy.
"I said for the hearing, I said I talked to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, and the accusation came up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, determined, unequivocal."
On the other hand, Graham’s vote appears to be written in stone.
“ I've already made up my mind about Bert Cavanaugh and there's gonna be an explosive accusation to be made, ” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bert denied it firmly," Graham added, referring to Christine Blazi Ford.
“ No one she mentioned could verify that.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see how anything can change."
What is the World Citizens Festival and did it contribute anything to reduce poverty?
The New York Sabbath will date the World Citizens Festival, an annual music event with a very impressive list of stars that will appear and an equally impressive purpose of ending world poverty.
The World Citizens Festival, held this seventh time, will bring to it tens of thousands of people who will flock to a large lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as G. G. Jackson, Cardi B., and Sean Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real purpose of the event - to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The 2012 World Citizens Festival is a continuation of the World Poverty Project, an international support group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless willing to pay for a VIP card), concert islanders must complete a series of tasks, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, calling, or other significant ways to help increase awareness for the purpose of ending poverty.
But how much success did the festival really achieve when only 12 more years ago its goal was fulfilled?
Is the idea of giving a free ticket to a concert to people really a way to convince them to demand a call for action, or is this another case of "clictiveism" -- people who feel like they're really affecting signing a petition on the Internet or tweeting?
Since 2011, the world’s civilian organization has documented more than 19 million “actions ” from its supporters, pushing for a variety of different goals.
He said that these actions helped stimulate world leaders to declare commitments and policies worth more than 37 billion dollars that would affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by the year 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements as a result of their actions, at least $10 billion of which had already begun distribution or fund-raising.
The group estimates that funds have been budgeted so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some major responsibilities include the Power of Nature, a British partnership of investors and activists committed to “helping children grow up to their full potential, ” promising to provide Rhonda $35 million to help put an end to malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter tweets from“ the citizens of the world. ”
“ With support from the British government, donors, national governments, and ‘ citizens of the world ’ like yourselves, we can turn social justice on undernourished in history, ” said the ambassador of the Power of Newtrition Tracy Ulman into an audience during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 activities had been done to the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced an appropriation for the project, Power of Nature, which would reach 5 million women and children with nutrition intervention.
In response to one of the common questions on their website that asks, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?
08 Citizens of the world replied: “It will be a long, hard path — sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great movements before us of civil rights and opposition to apartheid, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
G. G. Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B., and Janelle Monet are among some of the shows that will take place at this year's New York event, which will serve Deborah-Lee Fornes and Hugh G.
The U.S. can use the Navy to contain the Russian energy export - the Minister of the Interior
“ If necessary, Washington can use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including the Middle East, the American Home Secretary Ryan shot up, as quoted in Washington Examiner.
Zück claimed that the Russian involvement in Syria -- which was made, it is important to mention, by ordering the legal government -- would be an excuse to spread to new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to mediate energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said according to the report.
And according to the official source, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“ The United States is able, with our fleet, to make sure that the sea routers are open and in the time of the need to lay siege to make sure that their energy sources are not reaching the market, ” he said.
He made his appeal to the attendees of Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group who defines itself as "the voice of the energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued his words and compared Washington's attitudes with dealing with Russia and Iran, stating that they were the same.
“ The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, leverage and exchange of fuels, ” he said, referring to Russia as "one trick pony" because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration embarked on a mission to increase its condensed natural gas export to Europe, replacing Russian energy sources, which are a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump’s government officials, including the President of the United States, Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw the “inappropriate ” pipeline, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has often emphasized that the Nordstream pipeline project 2, which cost 11 billion dollars and that should double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion square meters, is an economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's strong opposition to the project is driven only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“ I believe we share the notion that energy cannot be a tool of stress and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers, ” said Russian energy secretary Alexander Novak after a meeting in Moscow with U.S. Secretary Rick Perry in September.
The U.S. position received a severe counter-reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Organization (BDI), the leading organization in the German industrial sector, called the U.S. to stay away from the European Union's energy policy and from the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“ I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply, ” said Dieter Kampf, head of the German Industrial Organization (BDI) following a final meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren ‘ Seriously Consider ’ the 2020 presidential run, said the senator from the .
Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would “consider seriously ” the possibility of running for president after the midterm election.
Warren confirmed his intention to run for president during a meeting at Holyoke City, Massachusetts.
“ It is time for women to come to Washington to repair our broken government, and to do that, a woman must head up, ” she said, according to The Hill newspaper.
“ After November 6th, I will seriously consider the presidential race.
Warren expressed her opinion of President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying that he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.
I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren strongly visited Trump for the appointment of Burt Cavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge.
In a tweet published on the day, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.
However, a survey published on the day of ‘ showed that most of Warren’s own constituents do not think she should run for the 2020 election.
Fifty-eight percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not run for office, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe newspaper.
Thirty-two percent supported the intent of running for senator's presidency.
The survey showed that there was more support for the former Governor Duval Patrick, with a 38 percent support for his running against 48 percent that opposed her.
Famous figures from the Democratic Party that rose in connection with a possible 2020 election match include former Vice President G. Jo Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision in January, according to IP reports.
Sarah Palin mentions Truck Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump's rally.
26-year-old Truck Palin spent a year in Iraq after he joined the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence a day at night.
“ What my son has been going through, what he has been going through since he returned, allows me to identify with families who experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries that you soldiers are returning to, ” she said to the audience attending a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the elephant in the room and said of her son and other veterans, “they come back somewhat different, they come back stiff, they wonder if what they gave the country is their fellow soldiers and airmen, and all the other military men are honored.
He was arrested a day in the city of Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, obstructing the report of domestic violence and possession of weapons under drunkenness, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vasilla Police Department.
18 countries and the District of Columbia support the challenge of the new policy of asylum.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia supports a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to harbor fleeing victims from situations involving gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and district filed a "friend of the court" statement on a day and ‘ in Washington to support the challenge of asylum seekers ’ policy, according to NBC.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sanchez case, who served the American Civil Rights Association in August, was not revealed.
She said that her “violent sons, members of the gang ” had abused her, but officials in the U.S. government rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace's state defenders described the countries of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, of which numerous requests for asylum in the United States, as nations dealing with many problems regarding gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. state asylum policy lifted a 2014 decision by the BIA Immigration Appellates that allowed immigrants without certificates fleeing from domestic violence, filing for asylum.
The District Attorney Carl Racine said in a statement on the day and ‘ that the new policy ‘ ignores tens of tens of years of state law, federal and international laws. ’
“ Federal law requires that all discussions regarding asylum requests rely on the special facts and circumstances of the request, and the barrier to the new policy violates that principle, ” says the State's friend.
The lawyers also argued that the policy that prevents immigrants from entering is damaging to the U.S. economy, because they tend to become entrepreneurs and provide needed work, they say.
Attorney General Jeff Sanchez ordered immigration judges no longer to grant political asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“ The asylum is open to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a specific social group or political opinion, ” said Sashens in a message about the policy he gave on June 11.
The purpose of political asylum was never to ease all the problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palo, while the death toll is doubled in the race to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation has become more difficult by the minute.
“ There is a feeling of tension, ” said 35 - year - old Risa Kosuma, and a feverish mother in the center of the evacuees in the ruined city.
“ Any minute now, the ambulance is bringing in bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Residents were seen returning to their broken homes, digging through waterlogged objects, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 earthquake, were flooded.
Some of the wounded, including Devi Harris, who suffered back and shoulder crises, were lying outside Palo’s military hospital, where they were treated for severe aftershocks that continued after the earthquake.
Tears filled his eyes when he told how he felt the violent earthquake shocking the fifth - floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the rubble, I think," Harris said to the IP Agency, adding that his family was in town to attend the wedding.
“ I heard my wife cry out for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're in a safe place."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with .08 propaganda ads.
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in American Dayon, an aggressive promotion of U.S. trade benefits to China, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to distribute propaganda.
The president of the United States Donald Trump referred to the last paid addition of the Chinese newspaper © China Daly, in the ©de Moine Register, the most-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of an intervention in the elections of the U.S. Congress on November 6th, claimed China rejected.
Trump's accusation that China tried to intervene in the U.S. election marked a new stage, according to U.S. officials, on the escalation campaign that Washington runs in order to put pressure on China.
Although foreign governments are natural to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now stuck in a rising trade war where each country raises and compares customs rates on imported products from its rival.
Customs rates, which China raised as an early reprisal in the trade war, were designed to hurt exporters from countries like Iowa who supported the Trump Republican Party, said American and Chinese experts.
Terry Bernsted, U.S. Ambassador in China, former governor of Iowa for many years, and an important export of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had damaged workers, farmers, and American businesses.
Bernsted wrote in a Sunday edition article by the Des Moines Reg: “She maintains bullying by publishing ads in our free press.
“ In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the tradition of free speech and the precious press of America, and publishes a paid ad in De Moine Reg.
“ On the newsstand in Beijing Street, you will find few dissident voices and you will not see any real reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people may have on the alarming economic route, considering that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, ” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers eluded the offer to publish ” his article, although he did not mention which newspaper it was.
The Republican Party keeps away women's votes before midterms with the Cavanaugh incident, warning analysts
While many Republican leaders side with Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh and defend him in the face of numerous allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned that they would see a counter-reaction, especially from women, during the next midterm election.
The feelings about the matter were particularly alive, and most Republicans are officially demonstrating their desire to move forward in the voting process.
“ This type of thing cannot be reversed, ” said Grant Rehar, a professor of political science at Sirkos University Maxwell School for The Hill on Saturday’s article.
Rehar said that he doubted that Senator J. Flake's last-minute efforts to launch an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
“ Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday — they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not November, ” she said on the day and ‘ Karin Zün-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesman for the MoveOn Progressive Movement, according to the Washington D.C.
On the morning of day and :, protestors cried out: "Nomber is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate corridor, while the Republicans in charge of the Senate Judiciary Committee chose to continue to promote Cavanaugh's appointment, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaisy Ford, according to the report of the Mic site.
“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation levels will break new records, ” he said to the news site Stu Rutenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
“ People say they were already tall; they were right.
But they can be higher, especially among floating voices of women in the suburbs and among young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, despite their lack of sympathy for the president, often refrain from voting.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which made her allegations about the sexual assault of the High Court candidate, analysts argued there would be a counter-reaction if the Republicans continued to advance the nomination.
“ The nomination caused the Republicans a serious mix-up, ” said Michael Steele, chairman of the former National Republican Committee, at the beginning of last week, reported NBC News.
“ This is not just about voting the committee or the final vote or whether Cavanaugh gets the nomination, but also about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated it, ” he stated to the Channel Gee Cecile, director of privateies USA, a group that helps select Democrats.
However, Americans seem to disagree somewhat with their belief in the testimony of Ford and Cavanaugh, with a slightly higher support for Ford.
A recent survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of the responders believed for certain or probably for Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed for certain or probably for Cavanaugh.
Plus, 38 percent said they thought Cavanaugh was lying for sure or probably during his testimony, while only 30% said that about Ford.
After the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as allegations made by at least one other complainer, Deborah Ramirez, according to Guardian newspaper reports.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Cavanaugh attacked her while drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his son-in-law to her during a party they attended during Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to start a new web to overcome Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web Network, launches a start-up company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of the man who became a legend in the technology world, is a company that will open the Solid, Berners-Lee open-source platform.
Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and who people are allowed to access the different types of data.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the meaning behind Inrupt was “control of the world.
“ We have to do it now, ” he said about the start-up.
“ This is an historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create “a personal online database ” or POD.
The database can include a list of contacts, lists of actions to perform, schedules, music library, and other professional tools.
Imagine Google Drive, Microsoft Outlock, Slack and Spotify being available in one browser at a time.
What is unique about the online database is that the user alone will decide who can access the information and what kind of information can be accessed.
The company calls it personal empowerment through data.
According to John Bruce, the CEO of the company, it means that Inrupt will find the resources, process and abilities that are appropriate to assist the Solid collision for everyone.
The company now includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a team with several developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer code programmers.
As of this week, technology developers from around the world will be able to create distributed apps using the tools available on the Inrupt Web site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not discuss “Facebook and Google their consent or refuse to instill a complete change, causing a complete makeover and overnight in all their business models.
“ We do not ask them for permission. ”
In the post published at Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt mission “is to provide commercial energy and an environmental system to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the face of the Internet when he founded the W3C Standard Organization at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in discussing network neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as the founder and director of W3C, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“ I am especially optimistic about the next age of the network, ” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: An event to commemorate the clergyman who won the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only member of the Church of England who won, as a warrior, the Victoria Cross during World War I, was mentioned in an event held in his hometown 100 years after the win.
He won the Victoria Cross on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Belenglies and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned he had won the highest British merit badge.
A commemorative stone was exposed by his two grandchildren, in a parade held in Rashden, North Hampton County, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that the discovery of the stone exactly 100 after his grandfather won the letter of excellence was “a wonderful symbol. ”
According to the London Gazette newspaper, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his regiment and crossed the San Canton Canal “through heavy fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns.
He then rushed to the line of fire and "greatest chivalry" led the line forward before rushing to take over a machine gun and brought down three of the company.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, one month before the war ended.
72 - year - old Michael Vann said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never compare to but something that humbles me.
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also placed a stranger after the parade, led by the Brentwood Royal Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that he “felt a great deal of respect for taking part in the parade ” and added that“ the power of a true hero is shown in support of many people.
The mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night watching the 206 Balator, and instead they got Papa Figg.
Imagine staying up all night to watch the action of Baltor 206 and eventually watching the main event was excluded from you.
The San Jose program included 13 battles, including six on the main card, and was aired live during the night on Channel 5 of Britain.
At 6 a.m., just as Jared Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for battle, the British viewers were shocked when the coverage changed to Pepe Pig.
Some of them were not impressed by the change after staying up until early morning especially to watch the battle.
One fan on Twitter described the transition to the children's cartoon as "a sort of sick joke".
“ It was a government ordinance that states that at 6 a.m. the original content was not appropriate, so they had to go to the children’s program, ” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communication at the Beltor, when asked about the broadcast.
“ Papa Pig, yes.
The president of the Blatour Company, Scott Coker, said they were going to work on their schedules to include the future British viewers.
“ I think when I think about the rerun, I think we can probably work it out, ” said Coker.
“ But it is 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday, and we will not be able to solve the problem until Sunday, in our time zone, that is, a day at ‘ in their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, during the transition, a lot of text messages were exchanged between the parties and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it. We thought it was a technical glitch.
But no, it was a government issue.
I can assure you that next time it's not going to happen.
We'll only have five fights instead of six -- like we usually do -- we tried to give the fans more and we just overdid it.
It's a matter of misfortune."
Desert Island Discs:
Tom Daly, the Olympic water jumper, said that as he grew up, he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexual orientation -- but that feeling motivated him to become a success.
The 24-year-old jumper said he didn't know until he got to middle school that "not everybody's like me".
In an interview with Desert Island Discs, on Channel 4, directed by Lauren Laverne, he said that he expressed himself on the subject of homosexual rights to give others “hope.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
The regular host of the old program, Christy Young, went on a several-month sick leave.
When he appeared as the star of Laverne's first show, Daly said that he felt “comforted ” by others as he grew up,“ it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls.
He said: “To this day, the feelings of inferiority, and the feeling of differentness, were real things that gave me the strength and power and allowed me to succeed.
He wanted to prove that he was something, he said, so that he wouldn't let everyone down when he finally found out what his sexual orientation was.
The man who won the Olympic bronze medal twice became the most famous leader of the LGBT community campaign and used his participation in the British Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on other countries to give legal status to homosexuality.
He openly expressed himself on the subject because he felt fortunate to have been given the opportunity to live openly and without consequences and to give others “hope. ”
The triple winner of the World Championship said that falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “surprised me.
Daley married an Oscar winner, 20 years older than him last year, but he said that the age difference was never a problem.
“ When you go through so much at such a young age ” — he attended the Olympic Games for the first time at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later — he said that it was difficult to find someone his age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black Daily, and Daley said his whole perspective had changed.
“ If you had asked me last year, it was all about me winning a gold medal, ” he said.
“ You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Ruby."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father didn't accept the fact that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 Olympic Games, because he wanted to be in the front row.
“ I couldn’t tell him that you wouldn’t be here to be in the front row, Father, ” he said.
“ I held his hand while his breath stopped, and only when he stopped breathing in truth and died did I finally recognize that he was not invincible, ” he said.
The following year, Daly competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
“ I just knew that this is what I've dreamed of my whole life -- diving in front of my home audience at the Olympic Games, it didn’t feel any better than that, ” he said.
It also inspired him to choose his first song, "Proud of the War Small", with which he identified himself during preparations for the Olympic Games and which still gives him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15, British Summer Time.
Michaelson failed in performance and got benched during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
The American golfer Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays for the 47th time at the Ryder Cup, but he'll have to upgrade his performance so the event doesn't become a miserable milestone.
Michaelson, who participates in the biannual event for the 12th time and sets a record, was benched on the decision of Jim Fjorick during the Four Balls and Four Balls on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he did in games with the United States, Michaelson, who won five times in the Major Tournament, spent half the day as a cheerleader and the other half working on his side game in hopes of correcting the ill evil from which he suffered.
Even at the height of his career, the player’s performance suffered from downs and ups, so 48 - year - old Michaelson is not the ideal choice for "La Golf National", where long grass routes are usually not forgiving for strays.
And if the competition itself isn't deterrent enough, Michaelson, in the ninth game of Sunday, competed against the exact British champion, French ‘ Francesco Molinari, who collaborated with the starting player Tommy Fleetwood and won all four games this week.
If the ambition of Americans, who lost four points at the beginning of 12 individual games, was to succeed in the first stages, Michaelson's game could have been decisive.
Frerick expressed confidence in his player, although we didn't expect him to say anything else.
“ He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, wrapped his arm around me, and said he would be ready tomorrow, ” said Fjorick.
“ He has a lot of confidence.
He's a member of the Hall of Fame and he's added a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but that's how it turned out, and that's how we thought we should proceed.
He wanted to be on the track, just like all the other players."
Michaelson will break Nick Paldo's record with the highest number of games in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may end his career at the Ryder Cup, which has never really matched his personal peaks.
Michaelson was credited with 18 victories, 20 losses, and seven halves, although Fjorick said that his presence added certain intangible advantages to the team.
“ He's funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of people, and he's fun to be in the dressing room with, ” he explained.
“ I think the younger players enjoyed having fun with him this week, and it was nice to see it.
It has so much more to it than the game itself."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great advantage may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from a significant advantage before the last day of the only games of the Ryder Cup may change for the worse.
The Danish player began his course at Valderama in 1997, when his partner, Seb Balestrus, had a five-point advantage over the Americans, which he lost nearly crossing the finish line with a minor advantage and won 1411⁄2-1131⁄2.
“ I keep reminding myself that we had a huge advantage at Valderrama; that we had a huge advantage in the game in Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won but with a small advantage, ” said Bjorn, in the photo, after watching the win of 5-3, in the 2018 tournament both day and ‘ Yesterday, leading to a 10-6 lead at La Golf National.
“ Then history will prove to me and to everyone on the team that this is not over.
We have to give it all up tomorrow.
We need to get on the track and do all the right things.
It's not over until the dots are on the board.
We have a goal to try to win the Cup, and we need to focus on it.
I've been saying all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of those who are facing us on the other side -- the best players in the world.
Bjorn was happy with his performance on the difficult golf course, adding: “It is important that I never get ahead of myself when it comes to golf.
Tomorrow could totally different.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on personal performance, which is completely different.
It's a pleasure to be on the track when everything's going well, but when you're out there alone, then your full ability as a golfer stands the test.
And that's the message you have to send to the players: you have to make the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he needs to make the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposing team captain J. Fyrick will expect better personal performances than his players, compared to their performance in the couples' games, other than Jjorden Sepith and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Fjorich himself knows both the winning side and the losing side, during the important final days of this type of tournament, after participating in the winning team in Brooklyn before losing, when the European team miraculously won the final game, as recorded in the film "Miracle at Medinah".
“ I remember every word, ” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players for the last day.
“ We have 12 important games tomorrow, but I want to make it through the early stages, as you saw in Brooklyn, and as you saw in Medinah.
When this momentum goes to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the mid-games.
We're preparing our lineup accordingly and putting the guys on track based on the feeling that we have, you know, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the fight, and he would face Rory McElroy at the summit game, Paul Cassay, J. Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Polterre, who are the rest of the Europeans at the top half.
“ I chose the cast in that order because I think he'll be able to get us to the finish, ” said Bjorn, referring to his only choice.
Acceptance of Germany's new warship was rejected once again.
Germany's new naval frigate was scheduled to be accepted in 2014 to replace the aging warships from the Cold War, but it was rejected in at least a year due to damaged systems and reduced costs, local media reports.
The acceptance of Rheinland-Pfalz, the leading ship on the new Baden-Wortertemberg-Class frigate line, was now delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the report of the newspaper Di Tzeit, which he quoted as a military spokesman.
The vessel was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but alarming issues after the supply closed the roll on the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wortertemberg-class cruises, which the Navy ordered back in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They're expected to include a powerful cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile batteries, as well as stealth technologies, such as acoustic signatures, infrared and reduced radar.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - the newest frigates can be deployed for up to two years away from the camels of the house.
However, repeated delays mean that the state-of-the-art ships, which should allow Germany to send troops overseas, will have become obsolete by the time they enter the service, indicated quite a quote.
The F125 F125 FFF frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to the Bluhm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to build ships after it was delivered.
Not much is known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media quoted a critical number of software and hardware deficiencies that made the warship useless for use on a battle mission.
The software eclipses were especially important because the Baden-Weertemberg-class naval vessels would be operated by 120 sailors—about half the crew used in the older versions, the Bremen Class.
It was also discovered that the ship had a dramatic weightlessness that reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add upgrades in the future.
The ship's weight is 7,000 tons, and is twice as heavy as the same type of ships the Germans used in World War II.
Besides the poor software, the price tag of the entire project -- which also includes team training -- also becomes a problem.
It was rumored to be 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) – beyond the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that fascinate the newest frigates become particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartles, head of the German Parliament Security Committee, confirmed that the Navy today “is running out of ships capable of deployment.
The official source said that the problem increased over time, as old ships were decommissioned but were not replaced by other vessels.
He expressed his regret that the Navy could not be joined by any Baden-Wortertemberg-class frigate.
The National Fund of Scotland listens to the secret life of bats.
A new study conducted at the estate in the Highlands of Scotland seeks to reveal the way bats use the landscape to hunt their food.
The hope is that the findings will relight the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study conducted by scientists at the National Fund of Scotland will track common bats and European telephones as well as brown-eared Dubenton bats in Inberio Gardens in Worcester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed on key sites around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
The NHS team (NHS) and volunteers will also conduct portable surveys using manual detectors.
An specialized audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequencies of bat readings and those of the species responsible for them.
Next, a map of the habitats will be drawn to create a detailed image of the size of the landscape, of their behavior patterns.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation consultant for the National Fund of Scotland (NTS) hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the advantages of the management work of the habitats, such as the creation of meadows and how to best keep the forest territory for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across Britain have grown considerably smaller during the last century.
They're under threat from development and construction work, affecting nesting and the loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also be a risk, as well as fly traps and certain chemical treatment of building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Actually, the bats aren't blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, bats ears are more useful when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo tracking technique to locate insects and identify obstacles to their flight path.
The NTS Foundation, responsible for handling over 270 historic buildings, 38 major genes and 760,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
She has 10 skilled experts, who do extensive surveys, nesting tests, and sometimes rescue.
The organization also established the first and only reserve dedicated to bats at the T.R.A.
The estate manager David T. Thompson said that the estate is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at T.R.I.E., we have a great area for the bats," he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the proper habitats.
But many things are not yet known about the bats, so the work we do here and in other assets will help us understand more what they need to thrive.
He emphasized the importance of testing to find bats before performing maintenance work within the assets, since the unintentional destruction of a single populated nest could destroy up to 400 females and cubs, possibly destroying an entire local population.
Bats are protected sex and killings, harassment and interference with bats or destruction of their nesting grounds are legally forbidden.
Elizabeth ‘ Pearl, a Scottish official of the bat conservation fund, encouraged the public to lend a shoulder and help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our species. We just don’t know what their populations are.
Ronaldo's dropping the rape charges while the lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo called rape charges against him Pike News, saying that people “want to advance themselves ” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German newsreel newsreel that Spiegel has released the charges.
The vanguard of Portugal and Euventus was accused of raping an American woman named Katharine Muerga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Suspicion suggests that he paid her $375,000 later to keep quiet about the incident, Dr. Spiegel reported on the day and ‘
The 33-year-old Ronaldo turned to 142 million followers on Instagram in the video lived several hours after publishing the claims and booed the "Fake News" reports.
“ No, no, no, no, no.
What they said yesterday, Pike News, said to the camera, "The player who won the balloon D", five times.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all is well," the actor added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Dr. Spiegel for the charges which have been referred to as "unacceptable reports of privacy suspicion", according to Reuters' report.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the actor would ask for compensation for “the amount of moral damage that matches the severity of the breach, and this is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in the suite of the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mirga returned, according to the report, to the actor's room and actor allegedly raped her, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mirga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her that he was a good guy by 99 percent that he had failed at 1 percent.
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed the couple had sex, but they were consensual.
Muerga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken in the hospital, but then she agreed to an arrangement outside the courts because she felt “scared of acts of vengeance ” and was afraid to be“ publicly humiliated. ”
The 34-year-old says she's now interested in canceling the settlement because she's still suffering from trauma due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Mancre United at the time of the alleged attack, and moved to the Italian Juventus Club in a deal that was worth 100 million euros.
BURKZITT: Britain will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
If you lose your position as the world's leading car manufacturer after the Berkezite, Britain's business minister Greg Clark said:
He added that the interview of the British Toyota to BBC, in which she said that if Britain left the European Union without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at her factory in Branston, near Derby, was “disturbing. ”
“ We need an agreement, ” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effect of delays on the border in the case of Barcasite without an agreement could cost jobs.
It produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, including 90% of the rest of the European Union.
“ According to my perspective, if Britain comes out without an agreement from the European Union at the end of March, we will see the production cease at our factory, ” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Branston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain raised concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how it would affect the cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW Company, for example, says that it will close its mini factory at Oxford for a month after the Berkzeit.
The main concerns have to do with what car manufacturers call the risk of supply chain.
The production line of Toyota is run on the basis of “just in time, ” with parts arriving every 37 minutes, British supplies, and other European Union, to make cars on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, there could be disruptions at the border, and sector factors say they could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota can't keep a stock worth more than a day at a factory in Derbyshire, says the company, so production will be terminated.
Clark said that Teresa May’s plan for the future relationship with the European Union “is precisely calibrated to prevent these tests at the border.
We want to reach the best possible agreement, as I said, not only to enjoy success in the present, but also to take advantage of the opportunity," he said on the Today Show on BBC Radio 4.
“ The evidence from Toyota and other car manufacturers is that the ability to continue the successful array of supply chains that we still have is absolutely essential.
Toyota didn't say how long the production would last, but in the longer term, she warned that the additional costs would damage the factory competition and eventually get fired.
Peter Tsublaris, who had worked at Bernaston for 24 years, and who served as president of the UNite Union at the factory, said that union members were increasingly concerned: “My experience is that if jobs were reduced, they would never be restored.
A government spokesman said: “We proposed a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the European Union.
Trump meeting with Rosenstein might be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, many depending on it, may “be postponed another week ” while the fight for Supreme Court nominee Burt Cavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller, who investigates Russian involvement in the election, ties between Trump's assistants and Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Washington gossip spent months discussing whether Trump would fire the Deputy Attorney General and jeopardize Muller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a wire to record the conversations with Trump and to get the president removed through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on the last day, he came to the White House, and reportedly he was about to resign.
Instead, there was a meeting scheduled for the day of ‘ with Trump, who was staying at the arrival of Rosenstein at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he'd rather not fire Rosenstein, but at this point the meeting was postponed to prevent a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, in which Cavanaugh testified and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blaisy Ford.
On the day and :, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week about the allegations against Cavanaugh, and rescheduled the Senate vote.
Trump's spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
In answer to the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “No date has been set for the meeting yet. It may take place this week. I can see a delay in another week given the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'm always happy to update the press."
Some reporters will appeal to this determination: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the host, asked why.
Sanders said that the frequency of the briefings did not result from the "taking a stand" of television reporters, although she said:“ I will not deny the fact that they are taking a stand.
Then she offered to increase the direct link between Trump and the press.
“ The president has more questions and answers than any president before, ” she said, adding without quoting evidence: “We checked the numbers.
The press briefings will still take place, said Sanders, but “if the press has a chance to pose questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do this in many cases, and you've seen that we've done it in many cases over the past few weeks, and encounters that will allow us to talk to the President of the United States will change the press briefings.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences during distinguished visits.
His press conferences are rare.
This week in New York City, the president may have demonstrated the reason for this, in a free and at times odd appearance in front of reporters gathered on the scene.
The Minister of Health writes to European Union employees at NHS Scotland and refers to concerns about Braxit.
The Minister of Health wrote to the staff of the European Union, employed by the National Health Service of Scotland, to express the country's gratitude and to ask them to stay after the Berkzeit.
The Scottish Parliamentwoman Jjyn Freeman sent a letter less than six months before leaving Britain from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already pledged to own permanent status requests for European Union citizens working in its distributed public services.
Mrs. Freeman wrote in her letter: “Over the summer, negotiations between Britain and the European Union continued, and he is moving toward the expected decisions in the fall.
But the British government also increased its preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know this time of year can be very upsetting for all of you.
That's why I wanted to come back and say how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the crew, regardless of their citizenship.
Fellows from all over the European Union and the world bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is obviously your home and we want you to stay here very much."
Christian Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering head trauma.
The back defender of the University of Tennessee Tigers, Christian Evercombi, underwent emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury from losing 31–27 on Saturday for the Vanderbilt University Komodors team, reported Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the Tennessee University Group, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
“ He went to the edge of the field and just collapsed there, ” said Reed.
The trainers and the medical team gave the Evercombs oxygen on the sidelines and then put him on a stretcher and took him for further inspection.
The University of Tennessee tells Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Evercombi was transferred to the Vanderbilt Medical Center for surgery.
Harris added that "there are no details of the type/surface of surgery" and the University of Tennessee is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is an athletic student and is his first season with the University of Tennessee after transfer from Illinois.
He participated in five tackles in total before he left the game and raised the total of his tackles in the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher stamp tax when buying property in Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher tax stamps while buying property in Britain and the additional revenue will be used to help homeless people, according to the new Conservative program.
The move will neutralize Corbin's move to attract new voters.
The incident of stamp tax will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The Treasury expects the tax to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged at a higher rate of stamp tax when they buy property in Britain - the extra revenue will be used to help the homeless, announce Teresa May today.
The move seems to be an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's move to attract young voters, with promises to provide cheaper housing and focus on high incomers.
No. The stamps will be imposed on people and companies who don't pay taxes in Britain, and adding revenue will strengthen the government's move to help those who are old in difficult conditions.
The payment, which comes as an addition to the current stamp tax, including higher tax rates on secondary housing and real estate investments for rent, may increase to three percent.
The Treasury expects the march to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new assets built in London are purchased by foreign residents, a condition that causes the increase in prices and makes it difficult for people who first purchase an asset to set foot on the housing ladder.
Many rich areas of the country -- especially in D.C. -- became ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris G. Johnson called for a stamp tax cut to help young people acquire a first home.
He accused large construction companies of taking land but not using it, and he urged Mei to abandon the quotas of affordable homes and to repair Britain’s housing reproach.
Corbin announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent control and the termination of evacuations “without guilt.
He also wants to give the councils greater power to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my term to restoring the British dream — that life was meant to be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build lives here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live in Britain, as well as companies based in foreign countries, can purchase homes with the same ease as hard - working British residents.
The dream of becoming landlords has become too far away for too many people, and the humiliation of sleeping in difficult conditions is too realistic.
My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland.
Director Sunderland G.J. Ross said his ultimate ambition was to become head of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman relishes the North East Resuscitation Challenge, currently number three in the first league, three points ahead of the ranking.
He moved to the Summer Light Stadium after leading St. Mirren back to first place in Scotland in the last season.
I wanted to play for my country as an actor.
I was in an international game once and that's it, Ross said to the Scottish BBC Sportsound program.
But growing up, I watched the Scotland team play the Hamptons a lot with my dad as a kid, and it was always something that pulled me back.
Anyway, this opportunity will only come if I manage the team."
The previous managers of Sunderland include Dick Ekdought, David Moys, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Foyeh, and Paolo di Canio.
The former director of Aloa Athletic says that he was not afraid to come after such established names in such a large club, after rejecting offers from Barnesley and Ipsowitz Town.
“ For me, success will now be measured by the 8%. Can I return the club to the Premier League?
Because of the structure and the facilities in this club, it definitely belongs to the Premier League, he said.
“ It is not an easy task to get him there, but I can only see myself as a success here if I can get the club back there.
Ross began his management career just three years ago, after a period as assistant manager at Dumberton and 15 months as team coach for the Hearts.
Next, he helped Elois out of the G.E.G., bringing St. Mirren up from the brink of the abyss to her position as champion of the season after that.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his acting career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Polkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
“ It was probably a real node, ” he recalls, about taking command of Elois.
“ I truly believed that the management position suited me more than the game.
It sounds weird because I played okay, made a reasonable profit, and enjoyed a few reasonable records.
But an actor's career can be difficult.
There's a lot you have to deal with every week.
I still deal with them when it comes to stress and stress at work, but management just feels right.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it, and I've never felt more comfortable with myself as an adult.
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound, Day One, September 30, on Scotland Radio between 12:00 and 13:00, according to British Summer Time
The perfect time for a pint of beer is 5:30 on Saturday.
The summer heat wave increased the profits of British pubs struggling for their existence, but caused stress in restaurant networks.
Groups of pubs and bars enjoyed an increase in sales at 2.7 percent in July, but the revenues in restaurants dropped 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA Business Advisory Company, who gathered the data, said: “The long - standing weather and participation of England’s world championships meant that July was a pattern similar to June, that the pub revenues increased by 2.8%, but the restaurants suffered an even worse blow.
The 1.8% decline in the June restaurant trade only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that focus on drinks recorded the most powerful performance, with a higher increase in revenue in the restaurant business, compared to the previous period.
Food-focused pubs also suffered from the sun, although they were less dramatic than restaurant operators.
Seems like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars, the sales rate increased by 6.6% over the month, and the food sales were down by three percent.
Paul Newman, with RSM to analyze leisure and hospitality data, said: “These results have continued the trend we have seen since late April.
The weather and influence of sporting events or important social events are the most important factors when it comes to the outdoors market.
It's not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle, although a 4.8% reduction in sales compared to last year, will be particularly painful in addition to all the constant costs.
The long, warm summer couldn't have come at a worse moment for food-focused businesses, and time would tell if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August would lead to the remission of what they needed so badly.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, and a slow reflection in brand launch.
The sales control factor for the pubs, bars, and restaurants in Britain, Coper Peach Tracker, a collection and analysis of performance data from 47 groups, with a combined business cycle that exceeds 9 billion pounds, and is a performance comparison measure set in the sector.
One out of every five kids has social media accounts they keep from their parents.
A survey revealed that one in every five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey, including 20,000 middle school students, revealed a tumor in the fake Insta pages.
The news has increased concerns about advertising sexual content
20 percent of the students said they had a master account that they show their parents.
One out of five children -- some of them just 11 years old -- creates accounts on social media that he keeps secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed rapid growth in counterfeit Insta accounts as a reference to the photo sharing site, Instagram.
The news has increased concerns about advertising sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said that they were running a clean master account to show their parents, but that they also had private accounts.
A mother who encountered the secret account of her 13 - year - old teenage daughter found that she asked others to “rape me. ”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC School Association of Independent Schools in Britain, found 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles and half of them admit that they have private accounts.
HMC head Mike Bochnan said: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them.
Ilid Doyle will be used as an "Athletic Voice" on the Scottish athletic board.
Ailed Doyle was elected to the Scottish athletic board as an outside director at the annual General Assembly of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the world's easiest athlete and chairman Ian Beatty has described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those who guide sports to benefit from her internationally rich experience over the last decade.
“ Ealid was greatly honored by the Scottish, British, and World Athletic community, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit greatly from coming to the board, ” said Beatty.
Doyle said: “I am eager to act as an athlete’s voice and hope that I can contribute and truly help with the guidance of sports in Scotland.
The American, who won 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and four Olympic gold medals in total, and is now a regular member of the BBC network, has lost his ability to go after having suffered a stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said only time would tell me if I was going to heal or to what extent.
It was hard work, but I fully recovered, relearned how to walk, and now perform speed and reaction exercises!
Thanks for the pep talk!
Advertising for milk pumps comparing mothers to online opinion party cows
An online milk pump company with an ad comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of the pump that should be “the quiet and applicable milk pump of the world", the technology company for private users Elvie published a humorous video ad to demonstrate the freedom of action that the new resource gives mothers.
Four real mothers dancing in a barn full of hay to a song that included such words as: “Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "in case you haven't noticed, it's not bristles, it's my breasts."
The song goes on to say: “I vacuum, I pump, I feed the babies, I pump, I suck, I milk my girls.
But the ad, published on the company's Facebook page, caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of responses, the video received mixed reactions from the viewers, and many said it sheds light on the milk industry's horrors.
“ A very bad decision to use cows to publish the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and have babies to make milk, but their babies are stolen from them in a few days after the birth, someone wrote.
Elvie's breast pump discreetly blends into an Elvie/Mother bra.
Another response said: “Traumatically to the cow and calf alike.
But hey, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?"
Another response said: "Advertisement is completely cut off."
Others defended the commercial, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was hilarious.
“ I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
Suction made me feel just like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I was referring to her content.
It's a brilliant product," wrote someone.
Another response said: This is a funny commercial designed for mothers who are sucked in (often in their workplaces or in the bathroom) and feel like cows.
It's not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group discover that they were all dancing with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women, who use milk pump, say they feel like cows.
But Elvie's pump is completely quiet, without tubes and wires, it fits discreetly in the breast feeding bra and gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out while pumping.
Anna Blarin, a partner in charge of the early development of childhood in Mother, stated: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that has deserved a bold and provocative launch.
In comparing themselves to women expressing themselves and milk cows, we wanted to place the milk pumping and all the challenges it has in the spotlight, and demonstrate in an amusing way that can be identified, the amazing sense of freedom that the new pump will give.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the runway for designer Martha Jacobowski using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children were quietly transported to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of immigrant children in custody spiked although the number of border crossings remained relatively unchanged, and one of the reasons is that Trump's conversation and policy made it difficult to transfer the children to sponsors.
Generally, most of the sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and were afraid to risk their ability to stay in the country by applying for child responsibility.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult households would have to hand over fingerprints, and those figures would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a high-ranking immigration officer and customs officer, testified to Congress that the Authority arrested dozens of people who applied for unsupervised minor sponsorship.
The Authority later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
“ Nearly 80% of their sponsors or households are in the country illegally, and many of them are criminals from foreign countries.
That's why we keep going after these people," said Mr. Albans.
In order to address solutions for the children more quickly, the officials presented new laws that would require some of them to appear before the court within a month of their arrest, instead of 60 days as acceptable according to previous regulations, shelter workers reported.
Many will appear through video conference instead of face-to-face to present their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are not found eligible for release will be sent away quickly.
The longer these children remain under cover, the more likely they are to develop anxiety and depression, and this may lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, said shelter workers and reports that have been released from the system in recent months.
Consultants say that these fears increase in larger facilities such as Tournillo, where it is likely that signs of the child's difficulties will be neglected due to the size of the device.
They added that moving children to a tent town without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or to break up with friends could make the trauma that many have already faced worse.
Syria tells the American, French and Turkish forces to withdraw immediately.
In an appeal to the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mullem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
He is also the Deputy Prime Minister, who said that foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally under the excuse that they fight terrorism and will be dealt with accordingly.
“ They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally, ” he told the assembly.
It was suggested that the war on terror was almost over in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we purged the Syrian lands from terrorist organizations and from any illegal alien presence" as one.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and counseling for Kurdish and Syrian forces that oppose the president at Eshtl-Assad.
France has over 1,000 warriors on war-stricken country soil.
As far as the issue of refugees is concerned, he said that conditions for their return are good and accused “some Western countries ” of spreading irrational fears that motivated refugees to stay away.
“ We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to assist their return, ” he said.
They're politicalizing the issue that's only supposed to be humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union warned not to send aid to the rebuilding of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition was accepted to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlieb, the last great rebel outpost, created an opportunity to progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkic agreement prevented a massive Syrian attack in support of the Russians on the province, in which three million people live.
However, he emphasized that the agreement had ‘ clear endings ’ and hoped that the military action would focus on the jihadists, including warriors from the victory front associated with the Al-Qaeda organization, which would be destroyed.
The UN envoy Stefan de Misture hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee, which will be made up of members of government and opposition, to draft a postwar constitution and pave the way for the election.
His employer set terms for the participation of the Syrian government on the committee and said that the panel work should be limited “to the examination of the articles of the current constitution, ” and warned against interference.
Why would Trump win a second term?
According to this logic, Trump will be reelected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers hope, impeachment and scandal will end his presidency before its time.
During which will undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale in the history of the presidency of all time! ”
Right now, there's no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, peak ratings have increased to over twice as many as 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled 1.6 million viewers on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in record time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the "Rachel Meadow Show" on MSNBC, reached the top of cable ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers on important news nights.
“ It is the fire that people are drawn to because it is not something we understand, ” said Neil Barr, the executive producer of the ABC drama series, “the designated survivor, ” who deals with a secretary of state who becomes president after an attack destroys the capital.

Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike all the other TV programs, the plot lines that come out of Washington may determine the future of the judgment of Roe vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Changing the channel or ignoring is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you go beyond the bounds of being educated citizens when you find yourself watching six hours of Paul Menport's panel of experts used by Bob Woodward as a confidential informant and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' horrific descriptions about, and forgiveness of the expression, "Tramp's Anatomy".
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“ Part of what he does, which feels similar to that of a reality show, is that he feeds you something every night, ” said Bert Montgomery, CEO of Whelehouse Entertainment and creator of the "History for Sale" program, about the team replacing you with Trump and the daily twists of plot (the war with the NFL, praises to Kim Gjong-un).
You can't afford to lose one episode or stay behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Place this week, it was sunny outside with a temperature of about 26 degrees on the north coast of Kaoai Island, but he shut down to watch MSNBC, recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away, not when Burt Cavanaugh was preparing to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.
“ I remember when we did all those crazy shows in the past and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Place told me.
I thought it was a joke, but apparently they were right."

Funds from outside sources are flooding the race for the closest mid-term congressional election.
It's no surprise that the 17th District of Pennsylvania is facing a flood of money, thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts, which brought two congressmen to the same seat.
The district, a suburb of Pittsburgh whose borders have recently been redone, has placed Democratic representative Connor Lamb, who has won his seat in another district, in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another congressman, Republican Keith ‘ Ruth ’ Foss, who is now representing the 12th District of Pennsylvania, who overlaps heavily with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the division of previous districts had been discriminated against, and against the Constitution, the results in favor of the Republicans.
The new 17th District race sparked a financial fight in the campaign between the financial weapons of the major parties, the Democratic campaign committee (DCC) and the Republican campaign committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a close election victory in March, which was widely anticipated for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The seat belonged to Republicans for over a decade, and President Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators anticipated a slight advantage for Democrats.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for support in China, and then retreated.
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already met in Beijing with slight resistance from Washington.
Trump had a hot meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varella, in June 2017, and held a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled Trump's management team.
State officials have decided to return the heads of the American diplomatic expeditions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama in response to "The Last Decisions to Never Know Again in Taiwan", said the office spokesman, in a statement at the beginning of the month.
But the penalty was only considered against El Salvador, who was estimated to have received $140 million from the United States in 2017, which included drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed punishments, including cuts in economic aid and focused restrictions on visas, could have hurt the country of Central America who suffers from unemployment and high murder classes.
During the progress of internal meetings, officials from North and Central America rejected an urgent conference that was supposed to focus on safety and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar conference last year that was seen as a forward step in efforts to prevent immigrants from reaching the United States.
But in the middle of September, senior officials made their wishes clear about the promotion of the conference, ending all punishments against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference participants, currently scheduled for mid-October, as a symbol of the importance of the government, said the diplomats.
And three American messengers quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman on Bolton's behalf refused to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal hearings, provided they remained anonymous.
Their explanations were confirmed by an external analyst, close to the government, who also spoke anonymously.
Learning History
The next obvious thing may come from the report of Special Counsel Robert Muller for obstructing Trump's alleged investigation into which there is now significant evidence in public records.
Muller is turning his investigation, according to reports, into whether Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in its attacks on our campaign.
If congressional control changes, Trump will find himself accountable to this body, just as soon as he's ready to face the voters again, possibly a jury.
There are a lot of questions here that begin with "if" and I'm not going to argue that Trump's fall is inevitable -- not even of his equivalents in Europe.
On either side of the Atlantic Ocean, we must all make choices that will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were willing to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West had opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to prevent the years of carnage as a result.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the march of unstoppable democracy, accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein's been in trouble since this newspaper reported that last year he secretly offered to record the president and speculate about his not being presidential.
Rosenstein said the Times report isn't accurate.
“ How will we respond if the F.B.I. investigation of recently asked Brett Cavanaugh is not full or fair - or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm election and appoint a Congress to cast Trump's responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy will fall into a long winter's slumber.
But I believe we won't fail because of the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who had been deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime who had also once conquered my glorious home.
She survived, immigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the same table that carries the swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Durance of the Range.
The rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on the day of ‘ and know that he defeated the Austrians, after his impressive case against Viriel in Spain earlier this month, will place them in a strong position to qualify from the G Group in the European League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Durance from showing up for the first time in the season to tie 2-2 with Viriel, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a jump board for better performance.
“ It was a good point for us because Viriel is a good team, ” said the 31 - year - old footballer.
We went out in the game believing we could get something and score a point.
We might have won at the end, but, all in all, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we got out of stasis in the second half and we were the better team.
Thursday's gonna be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it's gonna be a tough game because they got a good score on their last game, but with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can push and get a positive.
This past year has been really hard, with everything that's happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but there's a good feeling about the place right now.
The team is good and the guys are really enjoying it; training is good.
I'm hoping we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and make it.
Women stay awake because of that fear about pension savings.
Despite the fact that the surveyors had a clear idea about how they wanted to be treated, only a few people talk about it with their family.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term nursing care.
Only 10% said they talked to their kids about it.
“ People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take steps to have the conversation, ” said Holly Schneider, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance Society.
We can do this the next way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare the family to provide care if you do not express your wishes long before the time is right.
Use your counselor and family to discuss where and how to be treated, since these choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Share with your financial advisor: the counselor can also help you find a way to pay the expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a life insurance hybrid with a sum of money to help cover expenses, or self-insurance with your capital -- as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal papers: find an early solution to legal struggles on this occasion.
Find and appoint a health force, a reliable person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals fulfill your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Consider also signing power of attorney when it comes to your finances.
Choose a reliable person to make financial decisions in your place and guarantee payment if you're incompetent.
Don't forget the small details: imagine that your adult parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer any questions about medication or allergies?
Mark these details on a written program to be prepared.
“ The financial side is not the only point, but also who are the doctors?
“ What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare the plan."

Earthquakes and tsunami waves in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit Indonesian city Palo, said official sources, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The disaster led to the dissolution of communication networks and the official factors responsible for the aid were unable to get information from Dongala County, a region closer to the source of the 7.5 noise itself.
In Palo, over 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster hit.
You have some facts about Palo and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palo is the capital of the province of the Sulawesi Center, located at the edge of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city marked its 40th anniversary when the tsunami wave and the earthquake hit it.
Dongala is a province over 300 km (180 km) of a coastline in northwest Sulawesi Island.
The population of the province, an administrative area within the province, was estimated to be 299,200 people in 2017.
The main sources of income in the province economy of the Sulawesi Center are fishing and agriculture, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
Another important source of income is the nickel mining, mainly focused on Morvali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palo and Dongala have been hit several times by waves of tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Agency to relieve disasters.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
A tsunami wave also hit West Dongala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Ring region, known for its seismic activity and has been permanently struck by earthquakes.
Before you are some of the greatest earthquakes and tsunami waves of recent years:
A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of South Sumatra, on December 26, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian coastline, and more than half of the dead died in the U.S.A.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the West Coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nyas Island, off Sumatra Beach.
2006: An earthquake in South G.J. hit South G.A., Indonesia's most populated island, causing a tsunami wave that shattered on the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake hit the area near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
In 2010, an earthquake by itself hit one of the Mantaway Islands, facing Sumatra, causing a tsunami wave up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
A superficial earthquake struck Pied G. G. G. E. A. A. A. A. A. B. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A.

The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence.
Tarak Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, governor of Alaska and candidate for former Vice President of the United States, was arrested for assault.
29-year-old Palin of Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to the report released on Saturday by Alaskan police forces.
According to the police report, when a mine tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her.
Palin is in custody at the Matt Sue Pretriel facility under $500 guarantee, according to KTU's report.
According to the network reports, he appeared before the court on Saturday and declared himself "not guilty, for sure" when he was asked to make his case.
Palin was charged with three type A conduct offenses, and could therefore be imprisoned for a year and fined for $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B conduct violation, which allowed him to be punished for a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is now in front of the Alaskan veterans' court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing the report of a domestic violence crime, and possession of weapons involving the incident.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD due to his service in Iraq.

Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death penalty to suspect a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Scipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack who killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been carried out for federal crime in the state since 1953.
The 30-year-old Sifov used a rental truck of Home Depot to launch a bike-track attack on the side of the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, and Ders pedestrians and cyclists who got on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Sifub deliberately killed the eight victims and deliberately caused serious injuries to the body, according to the declaration of the death penalty, which was filed in the southern borough of New York.
According to the court's document, the death penalty can be demanded on these two counts.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury slapped Sypov with a charge that included 22 counts, including eight counts of extortion-assisted murder, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a felony charge and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded “a significant premeditation and premeditation, ” said the prosecutors, describing the way Sifub carried out the attack as "dirty, cruel, and sick."
"Sipholo Habibolevich" (Sipov) Sifov caused harm, damage, and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Ang) Linney, Nicholas Calvess, Ann-Lorrek, Darren Drake, Ariel Arlige.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the South Side of New York sued for death in a case happened a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after their conviction of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union two years before that.
The Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the court documents, Siphob, born in Uzbekistan, expressed no remorse in the days and months after the attack.
He declared to the investigators that he felt good about what he did, said police.
Sipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the bombing after watching videos of Dash on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to the police, he also asked to hang a flag of squash in the hospital room where he was staying.
He claimed he was innocent in response to the 22-year-old indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal defense attorneys representing Sipov, said that they were “disappointed of course ” by the prosecution’s decision.
“ We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than to accept an admission of guilt that would lead to life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events to everyone involved, ” said Patton.
The Sipov defense team once asked the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
A conservative MP says that we should appoint Nigel Prague.
==Plot==Nigel Prague took a vow to recruit the People’s Army today during a protest at the Conservative Convention.
The former leader of the UKIP said that politicians must feel pressure from the Aeroscapitals when a member of the Conservative Party of Teresa May claimed to be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
The Conservative MP Peter Boone said on the march in Birmingham that Britain was already outside.
But the challenge facing May, the very divided lines of the Conservatives, was emphasized by the joining of conservatives who support the remaining EU for a different demonstration against the Berkzeit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her settlement plan, the QHC, on its way despite attacks from the support of the Berkasite, the remaining supporters, and the European Union.
The Allies insisted that she continue to try and get an agreement with Brussels despite counter-responsive reactions and force the aeroscapitals and Labour Party to choose between her agreement and the chaos.
Boone said at a meeting of the Leave Means Leave in Solehol that he wanted to break up with the Hooks.
He claimed that Prague had to be accepted as a friend and in charge of negotiations with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we'd be out by now.
The MP from Wallingborough added:`I'll protect the Berkazeit, but we have to say goodbye to the Kers.
He emphasized his opposition to the EU and said, "We didn't fight in both world wars to be enslaved.
We want to make our own rules in our own country.
Mr. Boone dismissed the allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote, the idea that the British people had changed their minds and wanted to remain completely false.
The conservative parliamentary member and supporter of the Andrea G. Jenkins was also on the march and told the reporters simply: © I say: © Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Krückers program is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and among our activists who took the streets and chose us in the first place.
Please abandon the hook and start listening.
In a critical message directed at May, she added: © Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.
Prague ‘ said at the convention that politicians should be made to feel the pressure ’ if they were going to betray the decision made by the 2016 referendum.
This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political status.
They're trying to double-cross Brackett, and we're here today to tell them that we won't let you get away with it.
He added, in a message to the enthusiastic audience: I want you to make our political status, which is about to betray Braxit, feel the pressure.
We call upon the people's army of this country, which has given us victory in Braquisit and will never rest until we become independent Britain, ruling itself and proud.
At that moment, the remaining supporters marched in Birmingham and then held a two-hour conference downtown.
A handful of activists waved anti-Brackzeit posters after the group was formed this weekend.
The Labour member Lord Adonis ridiculed at the opening of the Conservative Convention on the security issues they suffered with the party app.
These are people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the possible technology to have an agreement like Canada plus, to cross a border without friction and free trade without borders in Ireland.
That's absolutely ridiculous.
There is no such thing as a good Berkezite.

Louis Hamilton ends up with a world title after the team's ratings have given him a victory over Sebastian Waterl.
It was clear, from the moment Walter Bottoms took the next step before Louis Hamilton on Saturday, that the Mercedes team ratings would play an important role in the race.
From the first moment Botas had a good start and he left Hamilton almost alone defending his place in the first two rounds and inviting Wettel to attack his teammate.
Walt went out to stop the middle first and let Hamilton blend in with the tail of the competition, apparently a crucial decision.
The Mercedes team went out for a stopover later and went back to the race behind Wettel, but Hamilton moved forward after a tight tire fight that eventually forced the Ferrari driver to leave the inner route to hold off without risk after a double play in the third corner.
Max Verstafen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back row of the rankings and was seventh in the final round.
He then led for a large part of the race and did not change tires to get a quick finish and bypass Kimmy Rhyconen for fourth place.
He eventually went down to a stopover in the 44th round and couldn't pick up the pace in the remaining eight rounds when Ronon took fourth.
It's a tough day because Waltery did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me pass it.
The team did an extraordinary job of getting to the double," Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein at a conference on Saturday in connection with her insistence that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blaisy Ford accusing Burt Cavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee for sexual assault.
During his talk at a conference in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and instead said that what happened in the Senate showed that people were “bad and despicable and lying. ”
“ The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people angry and mean and lying, ” he said.
“ When you look at the publications and the polls and then they say, “Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... Did you leak the document - “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
So, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak, he added in imitation of the senator.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford detailing the charges against Cavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September -- but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“ I did not conceal Dr. Ford’s charges, I did not leak her story, ” said Feinstein to the committee, according to the newspaper The Hill.
“ She asked me to keep his secret, and I kept the letter as she asked me to.
But the senator’s denial did not appear to have been accepted by the president, who responded during the conference on Saturday night: “I tell you, it was really bad body language.
She may not be the leak, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, claiming that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
“ They are determined to regain power at all costs.
You see the convictions, the despicable ones, they don't care who they hurt, who they run over on the way to power and power," said the president, according to Mediaite's report.

Air New Guinea says one person went missing after a plane crash in Laguna.
The airline, which activated the flight that crashed in the Pacific lagoon of Micronesia, now says that one person is missing after stating that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a message that starting in the afternoon on Saturday, she was unable to say what had become of one passenger.
The airline said she was working with authorities, hospitals, and local investigators to try and find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or citizenship.
Local boats helped save the passengers and other crew after the plane hit the water, attempting to land at the airport of Tqwok.
Officials said on the day and ‘ seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed Saturday at the hospital and that everyone who stayed is stable.
The reason for the crash and the precise course of events are still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane landed in Laguna a short distance from the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane missed the route.
American passenger Bill Gaines said the plane had reached a very low orbit.
“ That's a very positive thing, ” said J.
Jaynes said that he and the others were able to make their way to the emergency exits in the waist-high water on the sinking plane.
He said the plane crew panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.

An analyst lists the course of events the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution proved its case on Saturday at the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roosevelt of the U.S. Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the defendant’s movements, 29 - year - old Quinton Tellis, and the movements of the victim, 19 - year - old Jessica Chambers.
According to the calaryon report to the G.E.R., Revelt said he received the location data from a number of cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, contradicting his previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went out to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was with Sanford that night, Sanford said he was lying, because my truck was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other a week.
Rovelt said that some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted his text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“ He erased her from his life, ” said Hale.
The defense will begin its closing speech on Sunday, as planned.
The judge said he was expecting the trial to be handed over to jury litigation later that day.

Another black man?
A New York therapist is suing a couple for dismissal after a "racist" text message.
A New York therapist is suing a couple for discrimination after receiving a text message that was not intended for her from the mother who complained that the nanny was “an extra black person. ”
The couple denied being racist and compared the lawsuit to blackmail.
Lindsay Flexman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she discovered that her new child care, G.J., was black when she arrived at the first working day of 2016.
“ Another black man, ” wrote Mrs. Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Ms.
According to a report by the New York Post, after noticing the discharge of the mouth, Flexman fired Ms. ‘ Maurice, who was an African-American therapist, did a poor job, and was now expecting to hire a Filipino instead.
Mrs. ‘ Morris was paid for one day’s work and sent home with Uber.
Now, Morris is suing the couple for dismissal, asking for $350 a day compensation for six months of work and living where they were originally hired, though without a contract.
“ I want to show them, look, you don't do things like this, ” she said to the Post on the day and ‘ I know it is discrimination.
The couple fought back on the allegations that they were racist, saying that the end of Maurice's employment was requested, out of fear that they couldn't trust her after she was hurt.
“ My wife sent her something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not racist.
"We're not racists," said her husband Joel Flasco to the Post.
But did you put your child in the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was an accident?
Your soft baby?
Come on."
Flasco compared the lawsuit to blackmail and said his wife was due just two months before the event and was “in a very difficult situation.
“ Do you want to go after someone like her?
Not nice to do such a thing," added the investment banker.
The legal case is still in progress, but the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, killing the behavior and arguments they used.
A new letter reveals that Paddington’s publishers feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Gjnkel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: “It’s hard to imagine yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very amusing to know now what we know about Paddington's enormous success."
After saying that her father, who worked at the BBC as a photographer before being inspired to write the children's book from a small toy bear, would become bloodthirsty about rejecting his work, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book was "Mir-sweet", after his death last year.
She added that her father quietly prided himself on Paddington's success, which she described as "a very important member of our family".
“ He was a quiet man, not a proud man, ” she said.
“ But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who accomplished something: you’re proud of him even though it wasn’t really because of you.
I think he saw Paddington's success about that.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always said it was because of Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say hello to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Fester 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Ned called and said that she was really bad, that she wasn't expected to last.
“ Then I got a call from Ned saying that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I needed to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating slowly disappeared and out of her system.
She died sometime before, and it was over. It all stopped.
All I could do was sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't whine or scream or cry because I was surrounded right now by families and people.
I had to really hold on."
Eventually, Mrs. ‘ Adnan-Lafros, in mourning now for the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane alongside other passengers who were unaware of her last ordeal.
No one will know," she said.
My head was bent, and tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had this overwhelming sense of empathy with Ned.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women mourn openly hang on a bridge to prevent suicides.
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries hung postcards on a bridge in Walsh with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people could call for support.
Mrs. Davis’s son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
I don't want any other parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45-year-old, who lives in Laidy, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“ Everyone recognized him because of his smile.
They always said his smile lit up every room."
But he stopped working before he died, for he was “in a truly dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he killed himself.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid of a chain reaction."
Mrs. • Davis made the postcards, “so that people would know that there was someone to talk to, even if it was a friend.
Don't sit still, you need to talk."
Mrs. ‘ Humphries, Mrs. Davis' friend for years, lost Mark, a life partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“ He did not say that he was feeling depressed or depressed or anything else, ” she said.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was at rock bottom on Christmas Day -- when the kids opened the presents, he didn't make eye contact with them or anything.
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but that they overcame it: “It creates a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must all continue to fight."

Bert Cavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
“ I thought, if we could really get what he asked for — a timely and limited investigation on the scale — perhaps we could bring a little to the union, ” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee had been ‘ torn apart ’ at the underlying impasse of the party.
Why were Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters not interested in an FBI investigation?
Their deterrence is all about timing.
The midterm election will only take place for five more weeks, on November 6th, and if, as expected, the Republicans will not succeed, they will be greatly weakened in their attempts to elect the man they want for the highest court in the country.
George ‘ W. W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators to lobby him to support Cavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI gets his report out?
There will be a vote in the Senate where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently serving.
It's still unclear whether Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm his nomination to the Supreme Court.
? Under Kim
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has dropped since Kim G. J. Wong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean lawman.
Park Byung Sig, quoted data from the South Korean Union office and said that the number of defections last year was 1,127, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the main causes of this were the more severe border control between North Korea and China, and the amount that people smugglers charge.
Pyongyang didn't make a public statement.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, with which North Korea has the longest border, which is easier to cross than the DMZ, which is well-guarded between the two states of Korea.
China refers to defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often force them back.
The relations between the North and the South -- which are technically still at war -- have improved considerably in the last few months.
Earlier, the new leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for discussions that focused on negotiations stuck on nuclear disarmament.
The meeting took place after the historic meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim G. J. Hong-un in Singapore, where the two generally agreed to act towards an era where the Korean Peninsula would not hold nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ree Yong-ho blamed the sanctions the U.S. has made for the lack of progress since then.
“ Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will single-handedly dismantle our weapons first, ” said Ree in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Burt Cavanaugh "histrionic" and says he's not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate “historical ” and said that his character did not allow him to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi responded in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever showed up like that, they would have said, ".. ..historic," Pelosi said about her reaction to Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the day of the .
Cavanaugh emotionally rejected the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blaisy Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Cavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes almost screamed and choked talking about his family and his high school years.
He also specifically condemned Democrats on the committee and called for arguments against him “a coordinated and grotesque character murder ” organized by the Liberals ’ anger over Hillary Clinton’s losing the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she thought Cavanaugh's testimony proved he couldn't serve in the Supreme Court because it showed prejudice against the Democrats.
“ I think he recused himself with these statements and the way he pursued the Clintons and Democrats, ” she said.
Pelosi hesitated if she asked whether she would try to vote off Cavanaugh if his appointment was approved, and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
“ Let me put it this way -- if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not fit, not just for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is currently serving, ” said Pelosi.
Cavanaugh is currently serving as a judge in the Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she has concerns about Cavanaugh's possible rulings against Obama's health reform or the decision against Wade.
At his approval hearing, Cavanaugh avoided questions about the possibility of a certain Supreme Court decision being rescinded.
“ There is no reason for a hysterical, biased person to come to court and expect to be said, “Isn’t it wonderful, ” said Pelosi?
And women should use it.
It is a severe criticism, months, and years of rage overflowing, and it cannot express them without crying.
“ We cry when we get angry, ” said Mrs. ‘ Steinem 45 years later.
“ I don’t think it’s uncommon, do you?
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager elsewhere, who said that she too cried when she got upset, but she developed a technique and every time she started to cry, she used to say to the person she spoke to,“ You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are given as an outlet for rage, among other things because they are not fully understood.
One of my most significant memories of an early post in my life, in an office with a male majority, is that I once found myself crying in an unexplainable rage, and an older woman grabbed my neck, it was a cool manager from which I was always slightly afraid -- and dragged me into the stairwell.
“ Don’t ever let them see you cry, ” she said.
“ They do not know that you are furious.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they managed to get you down."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during the presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business and exited the race, Schroeder, who was deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she shouldn't consider the idea of running for president herself.
“ It wasn’t a decision that I thought well of, ” she told me 30 years later and laughed.
“ There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another contestant.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since she joined the campaign later, she was behind on the fundraiser, so she swore she wouldn't join the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"They think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During the speech where she announced that she would not embark on an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings of gratitude for people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and focus on voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexual discrimination -- she choked on tears.
“ You'd think I had a nervous breakdown, ” she recalls how the press responded.
“ You would think that I was sponsored by McClinks.
I remember thinking, what would they say about my tombstone?
"She cried"?
How can the U.S.-China trade war benefit Beijing?
The beginnings of the U.S. and China trade war were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a rift between the countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the opening shot earlier this year when taxing important export products of China including solar, steel, and aluminum receptors.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new rates affecting $200 billion in products ($150 million), in actually taxing half the imported goods to the U.S. from China.
Beijing responded each time with the same coin, and recently raised rates by five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has pledged to strike back at every blow in the United States, and it's unlikely that the world's second largest economy will give in the near future.
A request from Washington to withdraw means surrender to its demands, but a public bow to the United States would be too embarrassing for the President of China, Shay Jingling.
However, experts say that if Beijing manages to handle things correctly, the pressures from the U.S. trade war may support well in China in the long run, reducing the mutual dependence between the two economies.
“ The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic spin in any of the countries is actually far more dangerous than previously anticipated, ” said Abigail Grace, a research partner who focuses on Asia, the New American Security think tank.
*Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria says she's ready for a voluntary return of refugees and is calling for assistance to rebuild the country that was destroyed in a long war that lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Umem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“ The situation is more stable and secure now because of progress in the war on terror, ” he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore the situation to normal.
All conditions now exist for the return of refugees of their own free will to the country that they left because of the terror and unilateral economic measures that were intended to compromise their daily lives and their livelihood.
According to UN estimates, over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million other people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-derem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the ruined country.
But he emphasized that the regime would not receive conditional assistance or assistance from countries that funded the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Raydor Cup in 2018 and defeated the U.S. national team with a final score of 16.5–10.5 on the La Golf National out of Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six times in a row on European soil and hasn't won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe once again won the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Michaelson, who struggled for almost the entire tournament, sent his strike from a tee stake to the water on the 16th hole of Far-3, losing the game against France.
The Italian golfer Molinari polished in all his rounds, becoming one of four players who had reached 5-0-0 since the beginning of the tournament in 1979.
American actor Jjorden Sepith: Hobbs 5 and 4 by the lowest ranking player on the European team, The Warbjorn Olsen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's first ranked player, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may be the last time he plays in the Ryder Cup.
With eight participations in the Ryder Cup, the Spanish Sergey became the European player with the highest number of wins in tournaments with 25.5 career points.
“ I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a rough year.
So I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have the Cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," Garcia said emotionally after European victory.
He delivers the torch to his son, Gjon Ram, who defeated the American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in the only game of Sunday.
“ The tremendous pride I feel to defeat Tiger Woods, which I watched as I was growing up, ” said 23 - year - old Ram.
Woods has lost all four games in France, and his record is now 13-21-3, as the Ryder Cup Kid in his career.
These are strange statistics from one of the best players of all time, who won 14 important titles, with only J.K. Niklaus in front of him.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find its way through the lawns, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Pineau played high-level golf throughout the entire tournament.
The captain of the U.S. team, Jim Fjorick, spoke after the disappointing performance of his team, “I am proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We failed.
Good for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American Golf Association and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
Gotta take your hat off.
We've been defeated."
