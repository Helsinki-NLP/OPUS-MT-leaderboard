MPs in Wales fear to 'look like Muppets'
Some MPs were dismayed at the suggestion that the title of their duties would change from AMs to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This concern arose following plans to change the name of the deleted house to Welsh Parliament.
Members of parliament throughout the political spectrum are concerned that this will invite ridicule.
One Labour MP said his people were concerned that "it would rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
A member of parliament from the Pleid Camry party said that all its members were "unsatisfied" and offered alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said its members were "open to suggestions" about the name change, but noted that the name MWP (the acronym for "Welsh MP") sounded very similar to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in a similar way to the expression of the letter u in English in the Ukshire accent.
The House Committee, which is currently drafting the name-change legislation, said: "The final decision regarding any descriptive words regarding the names of the functions of the members of the legislature is of course the decision of the members of the legislature themselves."
The Wales Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh legislature the authority to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of consultation with the public on the proposals, in which broad support was given to change the legislature's name to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the role of MPs (AMs), the committee recommended the Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the MWP option received most of the support in consulting with the public.
MPs offer alternative options, but the struggle to achieve consensus may cause quite a bit of a headache for the committee chairman, Aline Jones, who is due to submit a draft legislation on the changes in the coming weeks.
Legislation regarding reforms will include other changes in the way the legislature works, including rules for the exclusion of MPs and the structure of the committee system.
It is the MPs' vote that will ultimately determine the title of their position during the legislative debates.
Citizens of Macedonia go to the polls in a referendum on changing the name of the country
The citizens will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "The Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was set in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, where a province called Macedonia existed.
Greece has long maintained that its name from the north is a claim to the territory of Greece and returned and opposed Macedonia's attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
Macedonia's president, George Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore its consequences.
However, those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaib, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in the Harlem neighborhood
According to Mr. Adams, "old neighborhood residents say there used to be a bar and church on every corner."
"Today there are no bars or churches."
He said the disappearance of bars could be understood.
"People's social lives today are going differently," he noted.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood living room where people visit on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the heads of the churches expect, "and sooner or later, they will find themselves again at the starting point."
According to him, the churches will occupy apartment buildings with condominiums that house people who are not the kind that will help neighborhoods maintain their unique character.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and therefore this will speed the closure of these churches, because it is unlikely that the majority of people who move to these apartments will join these churches."
Both churches were built by white faith communities, before Harlem became a predominantly black neighborhood – the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist community of believers left in the 1930s.
A black community of believers operating in the area became the owners of the building.
St. Martin's Church passed into the hands of a black congregation of believers under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th Street merchants, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused heavy damage to the structure, but as part of the plans of the faithful under Rev. Johnson to rebuild it, they commissioned the construction of the bell carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Johnson Sr. and who inherited his place in St. Martin's Church, proudly called the Kryon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played Kryon in July called it a different name: a "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ing of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who later played the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryweather said St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
What has taken place in St. Martin's Church over the past few months has been a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought by the heads of the local church, and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The Assembly – which is the Governing Body of the Congregation of Believers made up of local believers – wrote to the diocese in July a letter in which it lays out its concerns that the diocese will "try to roll over the costs" to the assembly, although the assembly was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some believers complained of a lack of transparency from the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy in dive to capture lobsters
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as the boy was diving to capture lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hummel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy cry out for help and then rowed there with a group to help lure him to the beach.
Hummel initially thought that these were just rave cries about capturing lobster, but then realized that the boy was shouting ’I got bit!
I've been bitten!"
Hummel said that as he approached the boy he saw that "his entire collarbone had been ripped off".
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hummel.
The boy was flown to Rady Hospital in San Diego where his condition is defined as human.
It is not known what species of shark attacked the boy.
Rescue commander Larry Giles told a press briefing that a shark had been identified in the area just weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species shark.
Giles added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Authorities closed access to the beach between Puntu Beach in Kasbalad and Swami Beach in Asinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to penetrate UK beauty products market
Sainsbury's begins competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and opens department store-style aisles with professional saleswomen.
As part of a significant initiative to penetrate the UK's 2.8 billion-pound beauty product market, which continues to grow as sales in fashion and household goods decline, the expanded beauty product transitions will be tested in 11 stores across the country and if the experiment succeeds, more stores will be added next year.
The investment in beauty products comes as supermarkets look for ways to use the space from shelves previously occupied by televisions, microwaves, and household products.
Sainsbury's said the company is expected to double its beauty product offering to up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time in its history.
Existing product lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have additional space with dedicated brand areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket chain is also relaunching its line of makeup products – Boutique – so most products will be vegan-friendly, a characteristic whose demand is growing among young buyers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop chain will review franchises at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croyden, South London, last week and the second will open in Leslie Oak, Birmingham, at a later date this year.
Shopping online and beyond buying smaller amounts of food daily at local convenience stores requires supermarkets to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupé, Sainsbury's CEO, said the branches would become more like department stores as the supermarket chain tried to fight off the cheap Aldi and Lidl networks with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's added sales points for Argos in hundreds of stores as well as a number of Habitat points since it acquired the two chains two years ago, additions that it says have boosted grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
Previous attempts by the network to revive the beauty products departments and its pharmacies ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the engagement ended after a dispute over how to split the profits from pharmacies inside the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy's business operations at 281 its branches to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds three years ago.
According to her, Lloyds will play a role in the program, by expanding the brand offering of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Sainsbury's Commercial Director, Paul Mills-Hicks said: "We've made a makeover in the look and feel of our beauty product transitions, to improve the environment for customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained employees who will be accessible to provide advice on the spot.
Our brand offering is designed to suit every need and attractive environment and our convenient locations make us an attractive destination for purchasing beauty products, in a way that challenges the old ways of shopping editing."
Peter Jones furious after Holly Willoughby cancels $11 million deal
Dragons Den TV show star Peter Jones voiced "outrage" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled a CHF 11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
As a matter of fact, Willaby doesn't have time for their home clothes and accessories brand.
The joint business of the two is considered similar to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced her departure in a post in Eastgram.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious by canceling at the last minute her participation in the two's high-end lifestyle brand - to focus on her fat contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones reacted "indignantly" when the television star announced during a stormy meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that due to her new deals – worth up to 1.5 pounds – she did not have enough time left to dedicate to their clothing and accessories brand Truly.
The joint business of the two was considered similar to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune, which was estimated to be worth 11 million pounds.
While 37-year-old Willaby posted on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones was on a flight from the UK to one of his vacation homes.
According to one of the sources: "Truly was obviously Holly's top priority.
It was to be her long-term future that would provide her with income in the coming decades.
The decision to leave completely surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
The company's warehouses in Marlowe are full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that leaving This Morning's pitcher, one of the UK's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions as a result of huge investments in diverse products, from pillows and candles to household clothes, and the potential for another launch delay.
And that may bring an end to a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as company chairman in March.
The couple spent vacations together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador for the M&S brand and replace Annette McPartlin as a presenter on ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We are not commenting on his business affairs."
Tough conversation and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he was getting from the news media about statements that some define as "non-presidential" and about being so positive about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said in a "news anchor" voice.
"I didn't make any concessions."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after praising their first meeting in June as a major step in the direction of denuclearizing North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have frozen.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "responsible response" from the United States to the initial disarmament measures made by North Korea.
Instead, he said, the United States is continuing sanctions aimed at continuing the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
"We are in great shape with North Korea," he said.
"We almost went to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results – stopping missile tests, assisting in the release of prisoners and returning the remains of American soldiers home.
And he defended his extraordinary attitude in his talk about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into that full stadium, we had about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing straight in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia have caused the destruction of an island and the killing of hundreds of people.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok have lost their homes, no national disaster has been declared, which is a condition for speeding up international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it's a bit challenging," Ms. Sombong said.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palo, it is not yet clear if foreign couriers will be able to pass through the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disasters Agency, said Indonesian authorities are engaged in assessing the situation in Palu to see if more international services contribute to the relief effort.
In light of the earthquakes that are constantly occurring in Indonesia, the country remains regrettably unprepared for natural disasters.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh County, they are rare in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the obvious lack of warning alarms about a tsunami in Palu, although there is a warning, contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of times, traveling among Indonesia's many islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship docked at Lombok to treat earthquake victims is making its way to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
Improving Indonesia's shaky infrastructure is at the center of President Joko Widodo's campaign, and he has invested heavily in roads and railways.
But Mr. Jocko is facing funding deficits ahead of his run for re-election next year.
Mr. Jocko also faces pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia as a result of the Muslim majority's religious radicalization process in the country.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes in battles between Christian and Muslim gangs in the streets – using knives, bows and arrows and other household weapons.
Video: Daniel Stridge of the Liverpool team compares at last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League with a goal in the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Stridge received a pass from Shakiri's office when he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal and his team was down 1-0.
He bounced the ball to his left and then turned a kick towards the far beam.
The ball flew high over the floor and landed towards the upper right corner of the net.
Eventually the ball landed over goalkeeper Capa Erizbalga who leapt towards him, and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to get to the ball and players like Shaq are always playing as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to make as much time for myself as possible," Soridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kanta and I made one touch and I didn't think about it too much and I just kicked."
Chelsea led 0-1 at halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blue forward passed a pass back to Matteo Kovacic in the same game, before turning close to the midfield and rushing into Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic performed a quick ‘give-and-go’ maneuver in the middle of the field.
Then he kicked a beautiful cross-kick, which led Hazar into the floor.
Hazar ran ahead of the defense and ended up with the ball inside the top right corner of the goal, with a left kick past Liverpool player Allison Becker.
Libpol will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia climbed to 832, the country's disaster agency said Sunday morning.
Many people are reported to be trapped in the rubble of the buildings that collapsed in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves up to 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sutopo Furo Neroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palo, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
Police launched a murder investigation after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. on John Street with her body stabbed, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling people from the area who have seen or heard something to turn to.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohgan said: "The investigation is at its beginning, but I would like to urge anyone near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask any person, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken a photo on a car camera, to contact us - because the footage may include information essential to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside a building.
On the scene this afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman arrived to ask questions about where she was this morning.
Investigations continue as police have announced that they are now in the process of delivering messages to relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mewes had just tried to get into his apartment, but was told that the police were forbidding anyone to enter or exit the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will be hours before they are allowed to return to their apartments.
A police officer is heard telling one person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman was seen at the scene as she was weeping.
She comes back and mumbles, "That's terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were spotted inside the scene and another outside.
Several police officers were standing inside the scene directing people in the apartment building.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a direct message on Twitter to MerPolCC, dial 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and specify the log number 247 dated September 30.
Cromwell's parliament statue has become the next target for attacks on memorials in the struggle around 'writing history'
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice in light of the 'Taliban' expulsion made by his Puritan supporters to so many cultural and religious artifacts in England.
But the Cromwell Society claims Mr. Crick's proposal is "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that in the current controversy over the removal of statues, the image of Oliver Cromwell standing outside Westminster Palace would become a target.
The shattering of the statues of the civil wars in England was not done on Cromwell's orders and was not carried out by him.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell falls victim to the actions of one of his predecessors in the dynasty - Thomas Cromwell - in the century before.
Cromwell's impressive representation in the hands of the sculptor Sir William Hammo Thornycroft is evidence of a 19th-century view and some of the historiography of a character that many think is still worthy of being honored.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as having defended Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
The question of whether this is an entirely accurate assessment is the subject of ongoing historical controversy.
An indisputable fact is that the struggle in the mid-17th century shaped the development of our nation later on, and Cromwell is one identifiable figure representing one side of the barricade at the time.
His achievements as the 'Lord Protector' are also worthy of respect and commemoration."
Deadly pig slashed Chinese farmer to death
Local media sources report that a pig attacked a farmer's death in a market in southwest China.
The man, who was identified by his surname as yuan, was found dead with a torn artery covered in blood near the pig pen at a market in Lupenshui, Guizhou Province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into a pig on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Shining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next day his cousin found him dead, and found a door to a nearby pigsty open.
He said a large male pig with blood on its mouth was found in the chamber.
A criminal investigation has confirmed that the 250-pound pig attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My uncle's legs were full of blood and leggings," said the cousin whose last name was Wu, as quoted in Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market Thursday morning at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked behind bars to prevent him from attacking more people, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family is reportedly negotiating with the market authorities about compensation for his death.
Although rare, it has been reported in the past that pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a husband on their ranch in Massachusetts causing a fatal injury.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig pinned a farmer in Wales to his tractor until the farmer's wife smuggled the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was devoured by his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the taste of blood may be a "trigger".
"They're just playing.
They're like naughty, very inquisitive children... They don't mean to hurt you.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rains in large areas of the Southwest U.S.
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
However, Storm Rosa will bring flood rains all over northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
The winds in the Rosa storm have reached a speed of 135 km/h, i.e. a Category 1 hurricane, and as of Sunday at 5 am Eastern Time, the storm's epicenter is 620 km southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a channel is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean heading east towards the east coast of the U.S. With Rosa approaching the Baja California peninsula on a tropical storm-shaped Monday, she will begin to push deep tropical moisture north into the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, tropical humidity that will combine with the approaching channel will create heavy rainfall in large areas of the Southwest U.S. over the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 100 mm of rain would cause flash floods and risk landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall to reach 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall in amounts of 50 to 100 mm is expected in parts of the Southwest U.S., especially in Arizona.
There may be flash floods with conditions rapidly deteriorating due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is highly recommended to avoid walking long distances in the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into raging rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong blowing winds and dust storms.
The approaching channel will bring local rains to parts of the southern California coastline.
There may be total rainfall amounts of over 13 mm, which may result in debris erosion and smooth roads.
It will be the first rain in the area during this rainy season.
Scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and the rain will strengthen and spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the "four corners" on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In October there may be sharp temperature changes all over the U.S., while the Arctic is cooling but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic changes in temperature between short distances.
On Sunday, there is an excellent example of the extreme temperature changes across the center of the United States.
There are nearly 10 degree temperature differences between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis to Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, prolonged summer heat will try to develop and expand again.
In early October, temperatures will be warm in most central and eastern U.S. regions, ranging from 27-31 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
In New York City, the temperature may reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 5 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast shows a higher chance of temperatures than average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched Thursday, on six television networks, the fascinating testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political debate continues, with breaking news in the middle of regular broadcasts to announce a surprising development on Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Cavanaugh groped her body while drunk and tried to strip her during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in fiery testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers was even higher than the reported 20.4 million viewers according to the Nielsen Index.
Nielsen tested the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Vanilsen usually finds it difficult to measure people who watch the offices.
By comparison, this is a crowd of spectators on a scale similar to that of the football playoffs or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose commentators are enthusiastic supporters of Cavanaugh's appointment, led out of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a full-day hearing.
ABC placed second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The level of interest remained high after the hearing.
Senator Flake was the main character in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican senator's office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination, he was filmed by CNN and CBS photographers as a group of protestors shouted at him as he tried to get into the elevator to attend a hearing on the legal committee.
He stood in a humiliated gaze for several minutes while the protesters scolded him, all of which was filmed live on CNN.
"I stand here before you," said one of the women.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement saying, before the elevator door closed, that he would say more at a committee hearing.
The networks and cables all broadcast live a few hours later, when the legal committee was about to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would vote for the nomination only on the condition that an understanding be reached that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate over the next week, which were demanded by members of the Democratic minority.
Flake was partially persuaded by conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After a conversation with Cones and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had power, because it was clear that Republicans would not have a majority to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "playing politics" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union that they were "playing politics" with Britain's future and hurting the national internet, in an interview she gave to The Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview that appeared alongside the idea with her on the front page of the newspaper, its former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her ‘checkers game’ plan for Brexit, saying the suggestion that Britain and the EU would back up each other's tariffs was ‘absolutely unfounded.'"
Wade Simms shooting: Police arrest Deaton Simpson as suspect in LSU player's murder
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for the LSU team.
A 20-year-old man named Deaton Simpson has been arrested and jailed for first-degree murder, Baton Rouge police have learned.
Officials posted a video of the Simms-Simpson debate, and police say Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said Simpson's DNA was on them, according to a report by WAFB, which is part of the CBS network.
After the Simpson investigation, police say he confessed to shooting Wade dead.
Bail was set at $350,000, as reported in the Advocate.
The Pathological Institute of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and into the neck.
The police gave credit to the Task Force for the Capture of Fugitive Criminals in the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police, and the civilians in the area who assisted in the investigation leading to the capture of the suspect.
LSU athletics director Joe Alva thanked law enforcement authorities in the region for their "adherence and pursuit of justice".
Simms was 20.
A forward basketball player who was over two feet tall, he grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
Last season, his average was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"That's what you're afraid of all the time," Wade said.
A volcano spewing ash on Mexico City
Ashes emitted from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned residents of Mexico on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded over the course of 24 hours.
In the center, several noises and tremors were monitored.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash cover on windshields of cars in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Sochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity on the volcano located 72km (45 miles) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists as the anniversary of the independence vote approaches
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police forces, while thousands joined protests against marking the first anniversary of the party's vote on Catalonia's independence.
A group of masked separatists who were stopped by riot police, threw eggs at the officers and sprinkled paint powder, creating black dust clouds on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Clashes broke out later that day as police officers were forced to use batons to overcome protesters.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "We will not forget, we will not forgive" in front of supporters of unity who chanted "Long live Spain".
Local newspapers reported that fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries sustained by the protesters.
Tensions remained high in pro-independence areas a year after the referendum held on 1 October was tried as illegal by the Spanish government, but was celebrated by pro-independence Catalans.
Voters chose a large majority to become an independent state, although the voter turnout was low when those who opposed separation mostly boycotted the vote.
Government authorities in Catalonia reported that nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups set up camps to stay overnight on Friday to prevent a show of support from the National Police.
The demonstration took place but had to be conducted on a different route.
Narcisse Thrams, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he had given up hope of Catalonia's chance of gaining independence.
Last year we had our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy about being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan separatist parties won an important, albeit stalemate, victory in the December elections, they found it difficult to maintain momentum this year with many of their best-known leaders either staying in voluntary exile or in prisons awaiting trial for their part in the referendum organization and following it the declaration of independence.
Juan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police support demonstration on his phone, said the conflict was sparked by politicians on both sides of the aisle.
"It's getting worse and worse," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Yonkers, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in prison awaiting trial since late last year, announced that he would run for election to the European Parliament next year.
"Standing up as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have witnessed from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Several men arrested after car crash-landed at home
Three men – aged 33.34 and 39 – were arrested after a car rammed several times in a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Belinagarg Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30pm British time.
Detective investigator Bob Bellmings said that there was damage to the gates as well as the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point an arrow was fired from a bow towards the car.
Manga kick gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Manga's first goal for Livingston secured the win.
Livingstone, who had just risen to the league, stunned Rangers and coach Steven Gerard that this was only his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Manga's kick meant a lot because Gary Holt's team moved a bit with Hibernian in second place.
Jarrar's team is left without a home win in the Premier League this season, and will face forward Harts, behind whom she is eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone extends the home lossless streak to six games, and head coach Holt has yet to experience a break since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone missed opportunities in front of a weakly hosted team
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before they scored a goal, when their directness caused Rangers various problems.
Scott Robinson broke ahead but dragged his attempts in front of a goal, and then Allan Lithgoy could only focus his efforts laterally after slipping in to meet Craig Helgett's header before the goal.
The hosts were willing to allow Ranger to play in front of them, knowing that they could make it difficult for the team hosted with free kicks.
And that was how the decisive goal took place.
The Rangers took a free kick and Livingston created an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to block Manga, who made a touch and scored a goal from the center of the plaza.
At this point, the Rangers controlled possession of the ball but found that home defense was impenetrable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained virtually unthreatened.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos did force Kelly to save the goal.
Scott Pitnam was stopped by Rangers goalie Alan McGregor and Leith Goy touched a wide ball from another Livingston free kick.
Cross-balls continued to enter Livingstone's plaza and brake, while two penalty balls - after a gleaning foul on replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for touching a hand - were removed.
'Amazing' from Livingston - analysis
Alastair Lamont, BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
An amazing game and an amazing result from Livingston.
All the players were excellent, and continued to exceed expectations in this upward swing.
Their style of play and staffing of the players have hardly changed since their return to the leading position, but Holt must be given a lot of credit for the way he has formed the team since his arrival.
He had so many stars.
The Captain Holkett was formidable, and led an incredibly organized defense, while Manga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warell at high alert all along.
The Rangers, however, were uninspired.
Although they were quite good at times under Jarrar, they did not meet these standards.
They lacked the final ball - only once did they open the home team's defense - and this is a red light for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the field.
Mixed reception for Erdwan in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies when Turkish and German leaders met on Saturday (September 29) for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – the goal of which was to repair relations between the two NATO member states.
They were divided on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey's acceptance of the European Union.
From there Erdogan continued to Cologne to participate in the opening of a new huge mosque.
Cologne is the city with the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police announced security reasons for blocking a public of 25,000 from gathering at the front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurds – have also spoken out, protesting both Erdogan's policies and Germany's decision to welcome him in the country.
The opposing protesters reflect the controversy surrounding the guest that some Turks in Germany praise him as a hero and others condemn him as a tyrant.
Car accident in Deptford: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 British time.
The driver of the car stopped and medics treated the injured man, but the man died on the spot.
The collision came after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run accident on Childer Street, about a mile from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
City police say police are trying to identify the victim and notify his relatives.
Instead of roadblocks and buses being diverted to alternative routes, drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lattin Prison: Six Jailers Injured in Riot
Six guards were injured in a riot in a men's maximum security prison, the prison ministry said.
The riot broke out at Long Laretin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 09:30 British time, and is still ongoing.
Special officers from a tornado squad were brought to the scene to eliminate the riot, which includes eight prisoners and a halt to one flank.
Guards were treated on site for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the Israel Prison Service said: "Extra-skilled guards were recruited to deal with an ongoing incident at Long Lattin Prison.
Six guards were treated for injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those involved will be handed over to the police and their prison terms may be extended."
Long Lattin Penitentiary houses 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor had been treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year riot police officers were called to the prison to deal with a severe riot in which guards were attacked with snooker sticks.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flash floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (shape zones may benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's expected to happen early next week, when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa cross the desert in the southeast and bring with them a risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already declared a flash flood hazard on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona into southeastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Storm Rosa is expected to pass a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix posted on Twitter that only 10 tropical cyclones remain in tropical storm status or a tropical depression within 322 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the Center for Arizona Hurricanes predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm on the margins of Arizona's Mogollon.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are expected to receive 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated locations receiving a total of 50 mm.
For those who are outside the flash flood danger zone, the rain of a rosé storm may be a blessing as the area has suffered a drought.
Although floods are a serious hazard, some of these rains will be helpful as the southwest region is currently suffering from drought conditions.
According to U.S. drought tracking, over 40 percent of Arizona is in a severe drought, which is the second most severe category," according to weather.com.
First, the course of the Rosa storm will reach land throughout the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa Storm, which is still at hurricane intensity on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of about 20 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, therefore weakening.
It is therefore expected to make landfall in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Rains across parts of Mexico can be heavy and cause strong flooding.
Total rainfall amounts of 75 to 150 mm are expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a chance of up to 250 mm," reports weather.com.
The Rose Storm will then continue into Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then continue across Arizona into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from a rosé storm, or its remnants, is heavy rains in Baja California, southwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert in the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause flash floods and improper flows from life-threatening deserts, and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsamar Norton Assault: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Norton on Sunday at around 04:00 British time.
He was taken to the hospital where he remained in a "stable" state.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset areas according to the flotilla.
Officers are asking anyone who may have mobile phone footage of what happened to contact the police.
Trump said Kavanaugh 'suffered the convictions and anger' of the Democratic Party
"A vote in favor of Justice Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's rudeness and shocking tactics," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered the convictions, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the accusation of Kristine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at a hearing about her accusation.
The president said on Saturday that "the people of the United States saw Kavanaugh's brilliance and quality and courage" that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh's appointment is a vote to confirm the appointment of one of the finest legal minds of our time, a legal man with an excellent record of public service," he told his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke about the importance of Republicans coming to vote in the midterm elections.
Five more weeks until one of the most important votes in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm actually a candidate," he said.
"And that's why I'm running everywhere to fight for great candidates."
Trump claimed the Democrats were on a mission to "resist and interfere".
A senior Republican Party aide told CNN that the first major procedural vote in the Senate plenum on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds killed in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and number rises
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were swept up in huge waves crashing on the beaches, when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials reported on Saturday.
Very many people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palo on Friday, when waves carrying on to a height of 6 metres (18 ft) crashed on the beach at sunset, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred following an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still minding their own business on the beach and not immediately fleeing, and they fell victim," said Sutupu Furwo Noroho, a spokesman for the BNPB disaster management agency, in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Noroho said, adding that the tsunami advanced across the open sea at a speed of 800 kilometers (497 miles per hour) before striking the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and they survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palo.
Air photos released by the Disaster Agency showed destruction to a large number of homes and shops, curved bridges and courses, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Sub-shocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia's BPPT stated in a statement that the energy released in Friday's powerful quake was 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to him, the geography of the city, which sits at the edge of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Noroho described the destruction as "huge" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
Bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Noroho said the number of fatalities and damage could be greater along northern Palo with a 300 km (190 mi) coastline, an area called Donegala, and which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The media "completely collapsed and there is no information" from Dongala, Noroho said.
The area is home to over 300,000 people," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its personnel and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get much worse," he said.
On Saturday, much criticism was directed at the agency for failing to announce that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was made public.
In an amateur video posted on social media, one can see a man on a high roof of a building shouting hysterical warnings about the tsunami approaching people on the street below him.
Within minutes a wall of water crashes on the beach, carrying buildings and cars.
The Reuters notice agency was unable to immediately verify that the photo was authentic.
The quake and tsunami caused widespread power outages that cut off communications around Palo and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending transport planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but the survivors are still in desperate need of food and other essential supplies.
The city's airport was opened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the rescue centers in Palo on Sunday.
The death toll in Indonesia's tsunami has climbed to over 800.
The situation is very difficult.
While World Vision personnel from Dongla arrived safely in the city of Palo, where shelters made of tarp were set up in their office yards, they passed mirrors of destruction on their way, Mr. Dossava said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is very difficult.
Even as aid groups began the unfortunate actions of driving the gears of disaster relief, some complained that the arrival of highly experienced foreign aid workers had been prevented from reaching the Palo.
Under Indonesia's regulations, funding, supplies and people from other countries can only be started if the affected area is declared a national disaster zone.
This has not yet been done.
"It is still defined as a disaster at a provincial level," said Olya Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we will be able to open the door to international aid, but this status has not yet been announced."
As the second night fell on Palo after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing held on to the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that illuminate the bleak stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been buried under rubble for two days, with her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia's paragliding team, coached two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped in the hotel see, and among them Mr. Mandaghy, were his disciples.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gandon recalls how in the hours after news of the collapse of the hotel sees widespread among the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palo, who took part in the beach festival.
However, his messages showed only one grey check mark, instead of the pair of blue marks.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves took $26,750 during the filling of an ATM at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $26,750 of a Brinks employee who filled out an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle emptied an ATM at the entertainment complex and prepared to bring more money, researcher Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man ran behind a Brinks employee" and stole a bag with money meant to be filled with an ATM.
A witness saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the announcement, but police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identity is requested to contact the Newport Police Department by phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The entity that was known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for a while and he used the nickname as the name of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande who cancelled her participation due to "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
In addition to being short for his current professional name, West has previously said the word has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible the word means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing the name of his album with radio broadcaster Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It has passed from Kanye, which means the one and only, to just "ye" - simply a reflection of the good in us, the bad in us, or the confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs became known alternatively as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names ‘Love' and ‘Brotherly Love'.
A former West partner, Jay-Z, also passed between versions of his name with and without hyphens and uppercase letters.
Mexican president pledges not to use army against civilians
Mexico's president-elect, Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador, has pledged never to use military force against civilians, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
Lopes Obrador promised on Saturday in the roundabout "never to use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Military forces fired on a non-violent demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were beginning to develop throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by providing financial support to those studying and opening more public universities for free.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. needs to double funding for AI
As China's activity in the field of artificial intelligence increases, the U.S. should double the amount it invests in research in the field, says researcher working in the field of artificial intelligence Kai-fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after various parts of the U.S. government issued statements about AI, even while the U.S. government does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its program last year: it aims to be number one in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Doubling the research budget in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next major AI achievement will be achieved in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in China's most prominent AI company: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the first ranked Reversi player in the U.S., and later served as a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Agency's Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects, and asked when she would be next, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking away our top researchers at the academy, it's the business companies that are doing it," Li said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have recruited stars from universities in recent years to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think a green card should be automatically offered to PhD holders in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its AI development plan for the next generation.
The Chinese National Endowment for Natural Sciences gives funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute rations to researchers in the US, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a joint artificial intelligence center to involve industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a special artificial intelligence committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an AI initiative under the name AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, a U.S. legislative initiative designed to create a national security committee for AI has been inactive for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on whether to change its name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that prevented it from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name is a claim to Greek territory and vetoed its accession to NATO and the European Union.
The two countries signed a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would harm the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign cast doubts on whether the voter turnout would meet the minimum of 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question in the ballot is formulated as follows: "Are you in favor of joining NATO and the European Union upon the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaib, claim that it is a price worth paying so that Macedonia, which is one of the countries created from the dissolution of Yugoslavia, can join bodies such as the European Union and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live in freedom under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means a protected life for all of us," said Olivera Georgizevka, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will abide by the results of the vote to make it permanent.
To change the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election committee said there were no proper irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, in which 66 percent of eligible voters came to vote.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Jose Tanevsky, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaib, his wife Zorika, and his son Dushko are putting together their ballot in Stromice, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, in a referendum in Macedonia on renaming the country, which will open the door to joining NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament House in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawarderkov prepared a small platform and chairs in front of tents that were set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with an upright head, not through the entrance of the servants," Kawarderkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can appeal to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian Union."
Prime Minister Ziev said NATO companies would bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zieb said after voting.
He said that a positive outcome would be "the security of our future."
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonia Policy Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum – less than the percentage required.
Another poll, conducted by the Macedonian television network Telma TV, found that 57 of the respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to succeed, the voter turnout must be at least 50 percent plus one.
Failure of the referendum would be the first significant loss of pro-Western government policy since taking power in May last year.
Video: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton's entire defense to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling broke Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero seemed to conquer the gate with ease.
The Argentine pioneer received a midfield pass at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before breaking into the open field.
At this point, Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one defender before running off a few more defenders on Brighton's wide border.
Then he kicked a left pass, and found Sterling.
The English striker used his first touch of the quad to deliver the ball back to Aguero, who kicked his right foot in defeating Brighton goalkeeper Matteo Ryan, with a ball to the right of the net.
"Aguaro suffers from foot problems," Manchester City's manager told reporters.
"We agreed that he would play about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the 'Heavenly Contents' their starting advantage in the Premier League rivalry.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's territory during this.
He sent a great cross ball across the right flank to Leroy Sanne.
Sanne dribbled the ball before leading Sterling towards the distant beam.
The Blue Sky player pushed the ball into the net just before sliding off the field.
Manchester City will face Oppenheim in the Champions League home game on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhine-Naccar Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoiler against the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was no good reason to force another start.
But Scherzer, who is highly competitive, hopes to win on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it still has implications for the playoffs for the Rockies, who lead one game on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West League.
The Rockies reserved for themselves at least an open ticket spot with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but have yet to secure their first spot at home.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can be able to play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the spectators and the other team will play at the highest level probably at every point I face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to deal with it?"
The Nationals have yet to announce the starter for Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to let Scherzer serve in such a situation.
Scherzer, which would be his 34th start, held a bullpen practice on Thursday and will serve on his day of rest - Sunday.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has a record of 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 rounds 2/3 of the season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly hinted at the situation surrounding his elected Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of Republicans coming to vote in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five more weeks to the most important election of our lives.
It's one of the most, most - I'm not running, but actually I am running and that's why I'm running everywhere and fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this horrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And if you are determined to take back the power by whatever means necessary, you see the convictions, the villainy.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that's what they want is power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats are, he says, on a mission to "resist and interfere".
"And you see that over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean and mean and dishonest."
He mentioned on her behalf the minority leader on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which drew loud boos from the crowd.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I waited until--it was really bad body language--the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a pluralist place.
She is intolerant of those who express their opinion.
When Momentum activists at my local party branch voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a line of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome – and only because we have expressed our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the decision to censor me criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, and Europe – for the most part, issues similar to those for which Jeremy disagreed with previous party leaders.
A committee on the East Nottingham Labour Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the General Committee meetings on Friday nights were just like that.
To this day, it is not the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of a ‘kinder, gentler’ politics long forgotten, if ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party has no tolerance for different views, and each opinion is judged by being acceptable to the party leadership.
This situation began shortly after Jeremy was elected leader of the party, when colleagues who had previously thought we shared a similar political view began to expect him to make a U-turn and take positions that I would never otherwise agree to – whether with regard to national security or a single European market.
Every time I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - immediately comes an abusive flood of social media rebukes with calls for impeachment, condemnation of the politics of the Centre and calls that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than many of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I am thrilled by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face every day a flood of racist abuse but never back down.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are already in the same pluralistic place, and with every ‘no-confidence’ decision or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes more narrow.
Over the past two years many have advised me to keep my mouth shut, not to be so loud and then I'll be "okay".
But that's not why I got into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, appalled by the neglect of the Thatcher government that caused my public school class to almost fall apart, I have been searching for how to fight for better social services for those who need them most – whether as a local councillor or as a minister in government.
I have never hidden my political views, including in the last election.
No man in East Nottingham could in any way be confused as to my political views and issues of contention with the current leadership.
For those who advanced the decision on Friday, all I have to say is that while the country is crawling towards Brexit that will hurt our families, businesses and public service, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But frankly the one message I have is not for the momentum movement in Nottingham, but for my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of impeachment threats or political utilitarianism will deter me from acting in a way that I believe serves the best interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: The Undefeated Air to the Top
Two recent freshmen tipped the final score slightly, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to win the entertaining and wonderful game held today in the Scottish Premier League.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the ten.
In the end, it was their better defense, as well as the much more risk-taking, that played in the best interests of the home team, and coach Peter Murchi had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've stood the test in our games so far, and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of the Melrose Group said: "Ire deserves all the credit, they took better risks than us."
Grant Anderson's Trey in the 14th minute, converted by Fraser Klimo, put Air in the lead position, but a yellow card for Scotland team player Rory Hughes released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to score points and Jason Baggott caught a non-Homer Trey.
Klimo raised Air's lead with a foul, before he actually scored at halftime, and then converted Trey Solo to a 17-5 win for Air at halftime.
But Melrose opened the second half well and Patrick Engerson's terrier, which was converted by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to severe injury by Roderich Knut, who was taken away on a stretcher, and starting with the game's revival, Eyre widened the gap through Stafford McDowell's Trey, which was converted by Klimo.
Acting Air Blair McPherson's captain then took a yellow card, and again Melrose took advantage of the extra person with Bruce Colvin's un-Homer Trey, at the end of a series of tremendous pressure.
But the home team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for attacking Klimo without a bullet, from the penalty line, McPherson captured a touchdown behind Air's advanced mullet.
Klimo converted, as he did almost from back in the game again, after Kyle Roy Ace kicked David Armstrong's Box and sent the Henry's grain wing to the home team's sixth trey.
Still Game star looks ready for new career in restaurant field
Still Game star Ford Kiernan appeared to be ready to move into the restaurant industry after it was discovered that he had been listed as the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular show, which he writes and which he stars with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season would be the show's final season, and it appears that Kirnan is planning life after Krylang.
According to official records, he is the manager of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was looking for ways to get into the thriving restaurant business in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia has no sea outlet hoping the court will open a path for it to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters cloaked in ships at La Paz.
Public buildings raise a blue-sea flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon carry the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
It is our duty to claim him back."
All over Bolivia which has no sea outlet, the memory of a coastline lost in favor of Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century, still lives – as well as the longing to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps at their peak for decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and is of course looking forward with a positive attitude to the coming," said Roberto Calzdilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the international court's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's demand that after decades of fragmented talks, Chile be obliged to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea to Bolivia.
Bolivia's charismatic native president, Eva Morales - facing a controversial re-election battle next year - hangs a lot in the decision on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But commentators believe that there is little chance that the court will decide in Bolivia's favor - and that even if it decides in her favor, it won't matter much.
The United Nations court in The Hague has no authority to grant territory of Chile, noting that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice came only six weeks after hearing the concluding arguments indicates that the case "wasn't complex", but Paz Zarata, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's claims, they may even have been weakened in the last four years.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current administration in Bolivia," Zarata said.
Morales' war rhetoric eliminated any trace of goodwill on Chile's part, she said.
Sometime Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The previous president, Eduardo Rodriguez Velza, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a "great opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of disputes for the benefit of both sides," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – is using the maritime issue as a political lever.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The ruling is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can trust the United States.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong, said his country would never deploy its nuclear weapons first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises it made during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two opposing countries.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of reopening diplomatic contacts on nuclear weapons that have reached a dead end more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was "a pipe dream" to think that continuing U.S. sanctions and resistance to declare an end to the Korean War would force North Korea to kneel.
The U.S. is afraid to agree to the declaration without North Korea first taking significant steps to denuclearize.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are interested in a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that North Korea is serious about giving up its nuclear arsenal, in which it is likely to see the only way to protect its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion show reveals new trend in huge hats found on its way to luxury stores everywhere
The solution has been found for anyone who wants to expand the collection of hats or receive complete protection from the sun.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a series of huge, crazy headdresses for their SS19 collection, at a fashion show that stunned the style scene at Paris Fashion Week.
Strictly impractical hats captured Instagram this summer, and these designers brought their extraordinary creations onto the runway of fashion shows.
Valentino's notable item was a beige overcoat decorated with broad feather-like margins covering the models' heads.
Other demilitarized-sized accessories included decorated watermelons, a magician's hat and even a pineapple - but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Tom Brown also revealed a selection of strange masks - check in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks included sewn lips and more like Hannibal Lecter than Hot Cutter.
One piece mentioned a diving mask including snorkeling and glasses, and another one looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And those who want to continue with a huge fashion statement - their time has come.
Fashion commentators predict that the giant hills are making their way to the upscale stores everywhere.
The Giant Hats are the next hit after La Bomba, the straw hat with a half-meter-diameter margin seen on everyone's head, from Mariana to Emily Ratajkowski.
The Cult Label behind the very impractical cap that flooded social media spawned another large piece on the track - a key-sea bag almost as large as that of the swimsuit model who carried it.
A burned-out written-color relaxation bag, with a loose strand margin and a white leather handle, was the prominent item in Jacqueline Le Riveira's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and big swimsuits to hit the luxury stores next summer - because the design has made a tremendous impression and it will be difficult to ignore the demand for excessively sized accessories."
John Edward: Essential Language Skills for the Citizens of the World
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this continues in 2018 with an additional set of outstanding test scores, reinforced by individual and group success in sports, arts, music, and other areas of the community.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, for a career in which they will choose and belong as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that is able to design and implement a customized curriculum, we find that modern languages continue to gain popularity as a sought-after field of study in the school.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language they understand, it goes into his head.
If you talk to a man in his own language, it goes into his heart."
It's an important reminder that we can't just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the latest tests this year, you can see that languages are at the top of tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high A score.
The data collected from the 74 schools that members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students achieved a high A score in Mandarin, as did 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish.
These data show that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and adolescents will no doubt need in the future.
Today the field of languages as a subject of choice is considered to be on the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the British Council on Employment and Skills found that of the reasons employers noted for Cody to fill vacancies, 17 percent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, to an increasing extent, language skills are becoming an essential necessity to prepare students for careers in the future.
Faced with the rise in language requirements for future job opportunities, these skills are essential in a world of globalization.
No matter which career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a significant advantage in the future thanks to this ability that lasts a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically position a person in an advantageous position over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language at a sufficient level for conversation, and French was the only language with a double-digit number of speakers, 15 percent.
This is why it is important to invest in teaching languages to children today.
Knowledge of many languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different as to the languages taught in it.
Some schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will learn languages that are considered the most important for the UK looking forward to the 1920s, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever the child's area of interest, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in the independent schools, with a team of teachers specializing in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, in any foreseeable future.
One cannot deny today, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, so this fact should be expressed in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer these levels of choice, diversity and excellence to the children of Scotland.
That's the order of the hour.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools.
LeBron is expected to play for the Lakers for the first time on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait was over for fans waiting to see LeBron James play for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the opening preseason game against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
It has not yet been determined how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," the Lakers' official website said.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games.
"At this point in my career I don't need preseason games to get ready," he said.
Trump rally time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a flood of election rallies tonight in Willing, Virginia.
This is the first of five scheduled Trump rallies this week, including stops at friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While voting for confirmation of his appointment to a Supreme Court justice, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be viewed online?
Trump's rally in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, Saturday September 29, 2018.
Trump's rally in West Virginia can be viewed online streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address hearings held this week for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, and have become tense around allegations of sexual misconduct resulting in the rejection of the Senate vote a week while the FBI investigates the allegations.
But the main goal of this caucus of rallies is to help Republicans facing a challenging election in November gain some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said the goal of these five rallies next week is "to incentivize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so critical to his agenda that the president is willing to visit as many countries as possible upon entering the crowded election season," said a spokesman for Trump's campaign who asked to remain anonymous.
This evening's rally, scheduled to take place at the Wasbanco Stadium in Wheeling, could bring in supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw press coverage from the Pittsburgh media," the West Virginia Metro News estimates.
Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia, the country he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrissey, who is behind in the polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should come to try to improve his situation in the polls," said Simon Haider, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuter.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows willingness to fight to keep hope ahead of singles games on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the Wednesday afternoon quartets may be just what the Ryder Cup needs.
Momentum's propulsion pendulum is a completely invented sport concept, but the players really believe in it, and never more so than in competitions like this one.
So where do they think the momentum is now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so you can see a little bit of momentum in that," said Jorn Speith at the end of Hume.
Europe in the lead, of course, four points ahead with another 12 in the game.
But Americans, as Spith says, feel that they have some wind in their sails, and they have a lot to cheer up for, and not the last of them in the shape of Spith and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boasts three points out of four.
Speith was deadly from the Green T to the Green and is a leader in a personal example.
The cries of joy intensified as his round continued, as he drowned a critical Pat to win the game four all-square and Thomas dropped two after two.
His Pat who won the 15on game won a similar outcry, the kind that shows he believes the American team still has hope.
"You really just have to dig deep and worry about your own game," Spith said.
That's all that's left for each of these players to do.
18 dimples to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Sefith and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed lead story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange, but charming, duo of Europe are four out of four and are all well-liked.
"Mollywood" were the only duo that did not hit over the standard (shoot the bogey) on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the back nine on Friday morning.
The same round, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic crowd, establishes the fact that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and will not be a more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal the potential European victory with the sun setting on the Le Golf National golf course.
Better both at the same time in different dimples.
However, it is too early to talk about European fame.
Boba and Tucson Webb Simpson finished with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he was mugged with Alex Norén.
Bogey and two doubles in the front nine dropped the Spaniards and Swedes into a hole they didn't come close to getting out of.
However, on Sunday there is no one to help you out of the pit.
It's fascinating to look closely at the four balls and fours because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is significantly ahead of the final day, but this fourth session showed that the American team was filled with a spirit of battle that some, especially within the United States, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 towards the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is in a healthy lead ahead of the last day of the Ryder Cup after finishing the four-ball and four-ball games on Saturday in a 10-6 match against the US.
Inspirational duo Tommy Fleetwood and Vernzesco Molinari led the change with two wins over struggling Tiger Woods, raising the gap so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side players, who tried to defend the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the Americans who missed the four-ball games this morning, bringing the series to 3-1.
The American players showed greater opposition in the fourth games, winning two games, but were unable to close the gap.
To continue to hold the trophy, Jim Forrick's friends need eight points from the only 12 games.
Fleetwood is the first European to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Mollywood" after an outstanding weekend, are just the second team to win four points from their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reid in the four-ball games, they went on in miraculous harmony together to defeat weakened Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambaugh with an even more pronounced score of 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself across two games on Saturday, demonstrated random bursts of excellence, but so far he has lost 19 of the 29 games of the four balls and fours, and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting during this morning's four-ball games, returned to join Henrik Stenson in the four-ball games to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copeka – who ranked first and third in the world.
However, not everything went easily to European players in the pleasant weather and light wind that blew southwest of Paris.
The prominent three-time winner Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a tight 2 and 1 win over Spain's John Ram and Ian Poulter in the four-ball games and later returned to defeat Pelter and Rory McLeroy 4 and 3 in the four-game four-games, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team returned from a negative four-point gap to the individual games, though as the holders of the cup, Purik's men only need a draw to continue holding the trophy.
However, after placing second for two days, a counterattack on Sunday appears to be beyond their reach.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister announced on Saturday at the United Nations that continued sanctions were deepening its distrust of the United States and that there was no way the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho announced at the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and a commitment to no longer develop nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national defense and under such conditions we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Sherry reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about the U.S.'s "rated" approach to nuclear disarmament that North Korea would be rewarded while taking gradual steps, his statement seems important in that it did not outright reject nuclear disarmament, as North Korea has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint announcement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to act toward "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea sought a formal end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the U.S. said North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States also opposed calls to reduce international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first' and increases sanctions pressure to achieve its goal by way of coercion, and even opposes 'declaring the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is a dream in the aspemia of people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the worsening sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president stressed in his speech at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the other side to the nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that the attack on U.S. soil by North Korea's missiles was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" who was on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened the "total destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarmament, but said that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain intact until North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a set time frame for this, adding that "if it takes two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia have argued that the United Nations Security Council should reward North Korea for measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with determination and without restraint until we achieve a full and verified final nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously supported the imposition of sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for its ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said later that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his recent visit did not go well.
He left A. Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for setting "gangster demands".
North Korea has promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear facility if the United States takes "compliant steps".
He said Kim told him that the "matching measures" he was interested in include security guarantees for which Trump had committed in Singapore, as well as changes in the direction of normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year teaches participants how to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the ever-expanding macho culture of learning by staying up all night using caffeine.
Academic research has found that students at the number one university in the world often have no idea when it comes to the basic principles of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kasisler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham & Wymans Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to open the course after a lecture he gave about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why am I being told this just now, in my senior year?'
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep – which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is delivered for the first time this year, explains to students the principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall condition.
Paul Briera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a senior director of health care at the university, said the university had decided to open the course after discovering that students had suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dorm room, where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, sportswear and books - to get explanations about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of a sleepwalking routine.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, if interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know it won't change the students' behavior overnight.
But we think they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Prof. Zeisler.
According to him, the pride culture on "sleepless night success" still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students cause the problem of sleep deprivation to grow.
Concern about adequate sleep, and good sleep quality, should be every student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, so we're hungry all the time.
Raymond Sue, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Zeisler design the course, after attending one of his first-year classes at Harvard.
He said the course illuminated his eyes and motivated him to encourage a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar teaching program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Zaisel recommended that students examine the possibility of setting a clock that would ring when it was time to go to bed, and not just to the time when they should wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of ‘blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and thus cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga goal decisive to Gerard's players
The Rangers suffered another attack of losing an away game when Dolly Manga caused Stephen Gerard's insurgent players to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox players had hoped to gain their first win in an away game since the February 1-4 win at St. Johnstone, but Garry Holt's team caused Gerard's second loss of just 18 games as manager, leaving the team eight points behind the galloping Harts in the top of the Scottish Premier League.
Manga attacked seven minutes before halftime and the uninspired Rangers didn't seem to be compared.
While the Rangers are now dropping to sixth place, Livingstone climbs to third place and immediately after Hibernian by a goal margin.
And possibly waiting for another double Rangers after Kwan Kallum Spence needed treatment for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown at him from the stands.
Gerard made eight substitutions for the team that passed Air to the semi-finals in the Tepperd Cup.
Holt, however, came up with the same 11 Livingston players who took a point from the Harts last week, and he could have been pleased with the way his players were curbing opponents in any situation.
The Rangers may have controlled the possession of the ball, but Livingstone did more with the ball he was in their hands.
They almost scored in the second minute when Manga sent a ball to Scott Pettman who kicked Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder kicked the ball too far.
Then a deep free kick by Keegan Jacob found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Leth Goy could only kick out of the beam.
The Rangers did take control, but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have ruled a foul after a quarter of an hour of play when he and Stephen Loyles collided, but Judge Stephen Thomson swung against the entreaties of the Colombian player.
The Rangers managed to kick only twice to the goal in the first half but goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly easily braked the header for Sana Kulibali and Obi Ajaria's weak kick.
While Livingstone's opening in the 34th minute was contrary to how the game was played, no one would deny that they deserved it at least for their hard work.
Again the Rangers failed to tackle Jacobs' deep free ball.
Scott Artfield did not respond as Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool by passing it to Manga for a simple finish.
Gerard did an act at halftime when he replaced Coolibley with Rain Kent, and the switch resulted in an almost immediate effect when the radical/wing infused a ball into Morelos but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block.
However, Livingstone continued to force the guest team to play exactly the kind of game they liked, with Leithgoy and the gatherers continuing to send out long balls.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the other stages, but McGregor stood up well to prevent an attempt by Jacobs before the label rammed the corner.
Rangers substitute actor Glenn Middleton later had another allegation of foul play against Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored it.
Almanac: inventor of Geiger counter
And now stand from the almanac of the Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and continue ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geyer developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as Geiger counter.
Since then the device has become a pillar of science, but in 1950 it has also become a pillar of pop culture thanks to the film "Bells of Coronado," in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred as two strange cowboys/scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that thing?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put the headphones together, you can actually hear the effects of radioactivity on the atoms in the minerals."
Evans: "Oh, my God, it's really cracking right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on after him.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and eliminate them
Immune teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, and modifying the cells in the laboratory
The cells can then "see" a protein that is shared with many cancers and are then injected back into the patient
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
In one woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to detect cancer cells, ovarian cancer disappears for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing the cells in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein called HER2 which is common to many cancers, and then injecting the cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Barzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Batseda, Maryland, said: "Our results show we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "motivates the development of a number of cancers," including breast, ovarian, visual and colon cancers, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has been successful in treating a type of blood cancer.
Kanye West broke out in a pro-Trump rebuke speech, with a MAGA cap on his head, after his SNL appearance.
It was frowned upon.
Kanye West responded with boos at the studio during a bewildered performance on Saturday Night Live, praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he will run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song on the show, called "Gost Town" which during his performance wore a Make America Great hat, he opened with a rebuke speech against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to white people who say, 'How can you love Trump, is he racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL episode began with a sketch starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, regarding allegations of sexual assault brought on by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the reprieve speech was not broadcast on the show, the segment was put on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock tried to roll on West in the release of the segment.
West also complained to the audience that he was being criticized backstage for the hat he was wearing.
They attacked me behind the scenes.
They said, 'Don't go out on stage with that hat on your head.'
They attacked me!
Then they said I was in a dark place," he said, according to The Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the dark place?" saying that he was "wearing my Superman hat, because that means no one can tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?
Try to show love."
His comments were booed at least twice by the crowd, and SNL staffers seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, and one of them told the newspaper: "Abyssy silence fell in the entire studio."
West was added to the show as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Mac Miller, had died just days before.
West stunned many when he performed the song I Love It dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by TPUSA Conservative Group Leader Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To the one of the bravest souls: Thank you for not giving in to the crowd."
But Actualist Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was just "who he is and it's totally wonderful."
"But I have chosen not to reward (by purchasing his music or clothing or supporting his 'art') that I think embraces and propagates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Prior to the show, Rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was "the entity formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Didi, Papi and P Didi.
Another rapper, Snoop Doc, held the name Sanof Lyon, and of course the renowned musician Prince changed his name to Sergeant and later to an artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harinton is known for his role as Jon Snow from the Swords fanfare series The Violent Medieval Fantasy Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho protagonist, saying that such roles on screen often convey to young children the message that they must be tough to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought something was ‘wrong’ and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married another star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31 years old, has admitted that he is "deeply troubled" about addressing this issue.
"Personally I feel very upset right now - where did we go wrong about masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men in their growing age, from the point of view of the problem we are witnessing now?"
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity, due to the very male characters it portrays.
He continued: "What comes from within and what is learned from outside?
What do we learn from television, and on the street, that makes young children feel they must be on this particular side of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
Because there's no doubt that something went wrong for young men."
In an interview, he admitted that he would not participate in any sequel or derivative series of Game of Thrones after the series ended next summer, saying he was "finished with battlefields and horses".
Beginning in November, Keith will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's "Real West" play, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother the bandit.
The actor has recently discovered that he sees meeting his wife Rose as the best thing to happen as a result of Game of Thrones.
"I knew my wife in the series, so in this way the series gave me my future family, and my life from that moment on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love interest of Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The two got married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate yard in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have the disease, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been contracted as a result of sexual intercourse, which is a change compared to the past.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV infection as a result of sexual intercourse is a burning problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality ceased to be illegal in China in 1997, but it has been said that discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of infection of the disease are the result of not using sufficient protective measures in these sexes.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has secured universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her team leaked information about a Republican senator and condemns the "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters rejected the allegations on Saturday that a member of her team had posted personal information about three U.S. senators on the senators' Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic senator from Los Angeles has estimated that the claims are being spread by websites and extreme right-wing critics."
"Lies, lies and more vile lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released reportedly included the residential addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate Committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court Justice Brett Cavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was linked to Waters' office and released the information about a member of Waters' team, according to a report by The Hill.
"This baseless accusation is completely untrue and completely false," Waters added.
"My staff member - whose identity and personal details were disclosed and whose safety was compromised as a result of these false and erroneous accusations - was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless accusation is completely untrue and a complete lie."
Waters' announcement quickly drew criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
This indicates that it does not have the temperament required of members of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not react with anger.
He must not react defiantly.
He must not question the motives of the accuser.
He must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to defeat Waters in the midterm elections, also raised his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her announcement, Waters said her office had appealed to the appropriate authorities and law enforcement officials about these false claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered," she continued, "and that they will be prosecuted for all their destructive and dangerous acts against my teammates."
A review of the film "Johnny English 3.0" - a weakened spy parody starring Rowan Atkinson
It is now common to look for meanings about Brexit in any new film with a British perspective, and it does seem appropriate for this revival of the action-comedy parody in the Johnny English series – which began somewhere in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English returning.
Is an ironic self-slap about how worthless we are going to become our country's new export opportunity?
Anyway, the wide-eyed, rubber-faced Johnny English got another chance to spoil things - and his name symbolizes more than anything that this is a wide comic piece meant for moviegoers in non-English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the silly English agent, who despite his bizarre pretense of slick glamour looks a little bit like Clouseau, a bit of Mister Bean and plenty of that guy who donates a single note to the car-fire tune in the opening text of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also based on the mysterious international passenger Atkinson played in the forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard, which leaves chaos behind.
There's one or two nice minutes in the latest edition of Johnny English.
I liked the part where Johnny English approaches the helicopter dressed in a medieval armor garment, and the propeller blades ring for moments on his helmet.
Atkinson demonstrates his comic physical abilities, but humor feels rather weakened and oddly unnecessary, especially since the "serious" type of spy films like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now include a comic component.
Humor feels like it's turning to kids instead of adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy misadventures are less brilliant and more focused than Atkinson's silent movie-style jokes in the character of Mr. Bean.
The plot of the film begins when a great danger threatens Britain.
A computer hacker infiltrated the British spy's super-secret Internet, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, much to the dismay of the lead agent - a sadly minor role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for a prime minister in an arrogant and battle-ready figure who is already suffering a complete breakdown of political loss of popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best to play the role of Theresa May, but she doesn't have much to work with from the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that because any active spy has been exposed, she will have to bring someone back from retirement.
And that means Johnny English the Barbarian himself, who is now employed as a school principal at a prestigious institution, but gives informal lessons in how to be an undercover spy: some good jokes here, when English offers a spy academy in the style of 'school rock'.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former assistant to the suffering mod Bough, which Ben Miller plays again.
Bough is now a man married to a submarine headquarters, in the role of 'annoying grade queen' on which Vico Pepperdine is slightly wasted.
Then Batman and Robin of her Majesty's Secret Service insertion into a terrible mess return to action, with a beautiful Pam Fatale in the character Ofelia Boltova played by Olga Korylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously captive under the charms of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems - the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bough begin their odyssey which is more of a farce of two clowns: under the guise of waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant; they create an underlamocia as they smuggle themselves in the luxurious yacht of Volta; and English ignites complete anarchy in his attempt to use a virtual reality kit to learn to know the inner structure of Volta's house.
There is no doubt that all efforts are being made to lead to the final sequence, but despite the likability and mischief, it has a sense of television for children.
Quite a mediocre level.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
Labour denies it is preparing a plan for the British to work four days a week but to get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a revolutionary plan whereby the British will work four days a week - but will be paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants corporate executives to shift savings as a result of the AI revolution to employees in the form of another day of rest.
I mean, the employees will have a three-day weekend, and they'll still get the same pay.
Sources said the idea would "fit" the company's economic agenda and plans to skew the country for the benefit of workers.
The Trade Union Congress supports the transition to a four-day workweek as a way for workers to enjoy the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party called for a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the ambition is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not a party policy and the party does not consider it."
Labour's candidate for finance minister, John McDonnell, took advantage of the party conference last week to formulate his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to bite back on power from 'faceless managers' and 'price takers' in service companies.
The candidate's plans for the Minister of Finance also stem from the fact that current shareholders in water companies may not get their full investment back because the Labour government may make "depreciations" on the basis of detecting misconduct.
It also confirms that there are plans to add employees to the boards of companies and create ‘included ownership funds' to transfer 10 percent of the equity of private sector companies to employees, which will bring in annual dividends of up to 500 euros.
Lindsey Graham, John F. Kennedy told the TV show 60 Minutes if the FBI investigation into Cavanaugh changed their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the findings of the investigation could convince any of the Republicans to withdraw his support.
In an idea that aired on Sunday on 60 Minutes, reporter Scott Pelley asked Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his party counterpart from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said before the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, the accusation came up, and I said ‘Did you do it?'
He was decisive, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, appears to be carved in stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and there will be a need for a blown-up accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And no one she mentioned could verify it.
The matter is 36 years old.
I can't see how anything can change."
What is the Citizens of the World Festival and has it contributed anything to reduce poverty?
The return of New York City will date the Citizens of the World Festival, an annual music event with a most impressive list of stars to appear and an equally impressive goal of ending world poverty.
The Citizens of the World Festival, which is taking place for the seventh time, will bring to it tens of thousands of people who will flock to a big lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real purpose of the event – to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The 2012 Citizens of the World Festival is a continuation of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert must complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, calling or other significant ways to help increase awareness for the purpose of ending poverty.
But how much success has the festival really achieved, with just 12 more years ahead of it to accomplish its goal?
Is the idea of giving a free ticket to a concert to people really a way to convince them to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of ‘clictitism’ – people who feel like they are really influencing by signing a petition online or sending a tweet on Twitter?
Since 2011, the World Citizens Organization says it has documented more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing for a variety of different goals.
He said these actions helped spur world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that would affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already begun distribution or fundraising.
The group estimates that the funds allocated so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and doers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential," and promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from 'citizens of the world'.
"With support from the UK government, donors, national governments and 'world citizens' like you, we can turn social justice on the subject of malnutrition into a footnote in history," Tracy Ullman, ambassador for the Power of Nutrition, told the audience during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were made calling for Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced an allowance for the project, Power of Nutrition, to reach 5 million women and children with dietary intervention.
In response to one of the common questions on their website that asks "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
"Citizens of the world" replied: "It will be a long and difficult route - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great movements ahead of us of civil rights and resistance to apartheid, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monet are among some of the shows that will be featured at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furnace and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy for 'sea quarantine' to delay Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
"If necessary," Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zink discovered, as quoted in the Washington Examiner.
Zink argued that Russian involvement in Syria – which is being done, it is important to mention, at the invitation of the legitimate government – would run to spread to new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And according to the official source, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States is able, with our fleet, to make sure that the seaports are open and when necessary to lay siege to ensure that their energy sources do not reach the market," he said.
Zinke turned to attendees at an event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were indeed the same.
"The economic possibility for Iran and Russia is, more or less, leveraging and replacing fuel types," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration has embarked on a mission to boost its condensed natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russian energy sources, which are a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to cancel its participation in the 'unworthy' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, has turned Berlin into Moscow's 'captive'.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which costs $11 billion and is supposed to double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion square meters, is an economic project only.
The Kremlin claims Washington's firm opposition to the project is motivated solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for applying pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting in Moscow with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in September.
The U.S. position was met with a backlash from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Organization (BDI), the leading organization in the German industrial sector, called on the U.S. to keep its distance from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kampf, head of the German Industrial Organization (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020, said Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed his intention to run for president during a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government, and for that, it is necessary for a woman to head," she said, according to The Hill newspaper.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider the presidential race."
Warren voiced her opinion about President Donald Trump during the meeting at City Hall, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren harshly criticized Trump for appointing Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice.
In a tweet released on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should run for the 2020 election.
Fifty-eight percent of "potential" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run for election, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the intention of running for the senator's presidency.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's run, with 38 percent supporting his run against the 48 percent who opposed it.
Mediated figures from the Democratic Party who are named in connection with a possible 2020 presidential race include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to I.P. agency reports.
Sarah Palin notes Trak Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump rally
26-year-old Trak Palin spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's been going through since he came back, allows me to identify with families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability that you our soldiers are coming back with," she told a crowd at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other veterans, "They come back slightly different, they come back stiff, they go back and wonder if what they have given the country their fellow soldiers and airmen, and all the other military men, is being honored."
He was arrested Monday in the city of Wassila, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, disrupting the reporting of the family violence and possession of firearms under drunkenness, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wassila Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge to the new state asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing situations involving gang violence or domestic violence.
Delegates from the 18 states and the district filed a "friend of the court" affidavit on Friday in Washington to support the challenge to asylum seekers' policies, according to an NBC report.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Rights Association in August, was not disclosed.
She said her partner and violent sons, members of the gang, had abused her but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace's state defenders described the states of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which numerous asylum applications are filed in the United States, as nations facing many problems when it comes to gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. state asylum policy repealed a 2014 resolution by the BIA Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented migrants fleeing situations of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Carl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state law, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that all discussions regarding asylum requests be based on the particular facts and circumstances of the request, and the barrier set by the new policy violates this principle," the affidavit said.
The lawyers also argued in an affidavit that the policy, which prevents immigrants from entering, harms the U.S. economy, as they tend to become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary work," they said.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"State asylum is open to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a specific social group or because of political opinion," Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
The goal of political asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that face people every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts at Palo, while the death toll doubles, in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more difficult by the minute.
"There's a very tense feeling," said Risa Kosuma, 35, and a mother of a fevered baby in the center for evacuees in the devastated city of Palo.
"At any moment the ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, digging through water-soaked objects, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were inundated.
Some of the injured, including Devi Harris, who suffered from back and shoulder fractures, lay outside Palo's military hospital, where they were treated for severe aftershocks that continued after the earthquake.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the rubble of the wall, I think," Harris told A.P., adding that his family was in town to attend the wedding.
I heard my wife crying out for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are in a safe place."
US ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American daily, aggressively promoting the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a paid supplement of the Chinese newspaper China Daily, in Des Moines Register – the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional election on November 6, a claim that China rejected.
Trump's accusation that China had tried to interfere in the U.S. election marked a new stage, according to official sources in the U.S., in Washington's campaign of escalation aimed at putting pressure on China.
Although it is natural for foreign governments to advertise trade promotions, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a rising trade war in which each country raises and compares tariffs on products imported from its rivals.
The tariffs, which China raised as a reprisal early in the trade war, were intended to hurt exporters from countries like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, U.S. and Chinese experts said.
Terry Barnstead, the U.S. ambassador to China, a former governor of Iowa for many years, and an important exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers, and businesses.
China, Bernstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Sunday edition of The Des Moines Register, "strengthens the acts of bullying by posting ads in our free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the tradition of freedom of speech and the precious press of America, and publishes a paid ad in Des Moines Register," Bernstad wrote.
"On the other hand, in the newsstand on the streets of Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the various views that the Chinese people may have on the worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers eluded the proposal to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper was in question.
Republican Party Keeps Women's Votes Away From Midterm Elections With Kavanaugh Incident, Analysts Warn
While many Republican Party leaders stand by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and defend him in the face of multiple sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that they will see a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiments surrounding the matter were particularly vivid, and most Republicans are officially demonstrating their desire to move forward in the voting process.
"This kind of thing cannot be reversed," Grant Rihr, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill newspaper in an article published Saturday.
Rihr said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute efforts (from the Arizona Republican Party) to launch an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women aren't going to forget what happened yesterday - they're not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the MoveOn Progressive Movement, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On the morning of Friday, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they protested in the Senate hallway, as the Republicans controlling the Senate Judiciary Committee chose to continue promoting Kavanaugh's appointment, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to a report by the Mic website.
"Democratic levels of enthusiasm and motivation will break new records," said Stu Rutenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
"People say they've been high; they're right.
But they can be higher, especially among floating women's voices in the suburbs and among young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, despite their lack of sympathy for the president, often avoid voting."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which detailed her allegations of the high court candidate's sexual assault, analysts argued that there could be a backlash if Republicans continued to promote confirmation of the nomination.
"The appointment caused Republicans a serious tangle," said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, NBC News reported.
"It's not just the committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will accept the nomination, but also how Republicans handled it and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priority USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to disagree somewhat about their belief in Ford and Cavanaugh's testimony, with slightly higher support for Ford.
A recent YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believed in certainty or probably Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed in certainty or probably Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Cavanaugh had lied for sure or probably during his testimony, while only 30 percent said so about Ford.
After the pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges raised by Ford as well as allegations made by at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to Guardian newspaper reports.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Cavanaugh attacked her while drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed his penis to her during a party that they attended while attending Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Start New Web to Overcome Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a start-up company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the man who has become a legend in the technology world, is a company that will develop Solid, Berners-Lee's open source platform.
The Solid platform allows its users to choose where their data will be stored and who people will be allowed access to the different data types.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "control of the world."
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create a "personal online database" or POD.
The repository will be able to include a contact list, lists of operations to perform, a schedule, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
Imagine that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify would all be available in one browser at the same time.
What distinguishes the personal online database is that the user alone is the one who decides who can access the information and what kind of information can be accessed.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, Inrupt will find the appropriate resources, process and capabilities to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a team of several developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer code programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world will be able to create distributed apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team do not discuss with Facebook and Google their agreement or refusal to introduce a complete change, which would cause a complete and overnight reversal in all of their business models.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission "is to provide commercial energy and an environmental system to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network being built at Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the face of the Internet when he founded the Network Standards Organization, W3C at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in discussing net neutrality.
Even during Inrupt's launch, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as founder and director of the W3C, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm particularly optimistic about the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: An event to mark the man of religion who won the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman from the Church of England to have won, as a warrior, the Victoria Cross during World War I was noted for an event held in his hometown, 100 years after the award.
Lieutenant Colonel and Rev. Bernard van, won the Victoria Cross on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never informed that he had won the highest British honor.
The commemorative stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren, at a parade held in Rashden, North Hampton County, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that the unveiling of the stone exactly 100 after his grandfather won the Medal of Honor was "incredibly symbolic".
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his regiment and crossed the Saint-Centan Canal "through heavy fog and under heavy fire from field guns and submachine guns".
He then rushed to the line of fire and at the "greatest gallantry" led the line forward before rushing to take possession with one hand of a submachine gun and knocked three of the company over.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – one month before the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Van said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never compare to but something that humbles me".
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also placed a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Royal Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honored to take part in the parade" and added "the heroism of a true hero is demonstrated in the support that will be given to many people".
Fans of the mixed martial arts stayed up all night to watch the 206 Belator, and instead received Pepe Figg.
Imagine staying up all night to watch the action of Bellator 206 and eventually watching the main event is ruled out of you.
The San Jose show consisted of 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was shown live during the night on British Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Jagard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for battle, viewers in the UK remained stunned as coverage changed to Pepe Figg.
Some of them were not impressed with the change after staying up until the early morning hours especially to watch the battle.
One fan described Twitter's move to the children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke".
"This is a government regulation that states that at 6 a.m. the original content was not appropriate and therefore they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pepa Pig, yes."
Blator president Scott Coker said they intend to work on their schedules to include future British viewers.
"I think when I think about the replay, I think we can probably work it out," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday there and we won't be able to solve the problem until Sunday in our time zone, that is on Monday in their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, during the transition a lot of text messages were exchanged between the parties and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But no, it was a government problem.
I can assure you that next time it's not going to happen.
We'll only have five fights instead of six - as we usually do - we tried to give the fans more and we just went too far.
It's a matter of misfortune."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly felt 'inferior' because of his sexual orientation
Tom Daly, the Olympic jumper in the water, said that while growing up he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexual orientation – but that this feeling motivated him to become a success.
The 24-year-old jumper said he didn't know until he got to middle school that "not everyone is like me."
In an interview on Channel 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out on the issue of gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympic Games.
The old show's regular host, Christy Young, has been on sick leave for several months.
In his appearance as the star of Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "inferior" to the others as he grew up because "it was socially unacceptable to love boys and girls".
He said: "Until today, the feeling of inferiority, and the feeling of variance, were real things that gave me the strength and strength and allowed me to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they eventually found out what his sexual orientation was.
The man who won the Olympic bronze medal twice became a mediated leader of the LGBT community campaign and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on other countries to legalize homosexuality.
He spoke openly on the subject because he felt lucky to have been given the opportunity to live openly and without consequences and wanted to give others "hope".
The triple winner of the World Series said that falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "took me by surprise".
Daly married the Oscar-winning actor, 20 years his senior, last year but he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he participated in the Olympic Games for the first time at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone his age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said his "all point of view" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Ruby."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daly said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics – because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't say to him, 'You won't be here to be in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand while his breathing ceased and it was only when he stopped breathing that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
A year later, Daly competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that's what I've been dreaming about my whole life - diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympic Games, there wasn't a better feeling," he said.
This is also what inspired him to choose his first song – Heather Small's Proud – with which he identified himself during preparations for the Olympic Games and which still makes him a duck skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 pm, British Summer Time.
Michaelson disappointed in performance and went to the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American golfer Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays for the 47th time in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to upgrade his performance so that the event does not become a miserable milestone.
Michaelson, who participates in the biennial event for the 12th time and sets a record, went down the bench on Jim Furyk's decision during the Foursomes games on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as is the custom with the U.S. team, Michaelson, who has won the major tournament five times, spent half the day as a cheerleader and the other half working on his game on the sidelines in hopes of correcting the sick evil he suffered.
Even at the height of his career, the player's performance suffered from downs and ups. Thus, 48-year-old Michaelson is not the ideal choice for La Golf National, where the long grass courses are not usually forgiving of stray strokes.
And if the competition itself isn't daunting enough, Michaelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, competed against the exact British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who collaborated with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and won all four of their games this week.
If the ambition of the Americans, who lost four points in the beginning of the 12 individual games, was to succeed in the initial stages, Michaelson's game could have been decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, though we did not expect him to say anything else.
"He completely understood his role today, tapped me on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," he said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has added a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but that's how it turned out and that's how we thought we should keep going.
He wanted to be on the track, just like all the other players."
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record with the highest number of Raider Cup games on Sunday.
This may end his career in the Ryder Cup, which never really matched his personal highs.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves to his credit, though Fioric said his presence added some intangible benefits to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of people, and it's fun to be in the dressing room with him," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed having fun with him this week, and it was nice to see that.
It goes beyond the game itself."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the big advantage may soon be gone
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage before the last day of the Raider Cup's individual games may change for the worse.
The Danish player started out in a game at Valdarama in 1997, when his partner, Sev Balstros, had a five-point lead over the Americans, which he lost almost crossing the finish line with a minor lead and won 141-2-131-2.
"I keep reminding myself that we had a great advantage in Valderama; that we had a great advantage in a game in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderama where we won but with minimal advantage," said Bjorn, in the photo, after watching a 5-3 win, in the 2018 tournament on both Friday and yesterday, which led to a 10-6 lead at La Golf National.
"So history will prove to me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Everything has to be given tomorrow.
You have to get on track and do all the right things.
It's not over until the dots are on the board.
We have a goal, to try to win the cup, and we need to focus on it.
I've said all along, I'm focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we're very aware of those who are facing us on the other side - the best players in the world."
Bjorn was delighted with his players' performance on the hard golf course and added: "It's important to me never to get ahead of the later when it comes to golf.
Tomorrow could be completely different.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on individual performance, which is completely different.
It's a pleasure to be on the track when everything's going well, but when you're out there alone, then your full ability as a golfer is put to the test.
And this is the message that needs to be conveyed to the players: You need to make the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to make the best of himself too."
Unlike Bjorn, opposing team captain Jim Furyk will expect better personal performance from his players, compared to their performance in the doubles games, apart from Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who have won three points out of four.
Furyk himself knows both the winning side and the losing side, during the important closing days of such tournaments, having participated in the winning team in Brooklyn before losing, as the European team that miraculously managed to win the final match, as documented in the film "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players towards the final day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but I want to succeed in the early stages, as you saw in Brooklyn, and as you saw in Medinah.
As this momentum shifts to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We prepare our lineup accordingly and get the guys on track according to the feeling that we have, you know, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the fight and he will face Rory McElroy in the summit match, with Paul Cassay, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Falter, who are the other Europeans in the top half.
"I chose the team of players in that order because I think he'll be able to get us to the end," Bjorn said when referring to his only choice.
The acceptance of Germany's new warship has been postponed once again.
Germany's new fleet frigate was to be accepted in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era warships, but it was postponed for at least a year, due to faulty systems and reduced cost, local media reported.
The acceptance of Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship on the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate line, was now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a report by the newspaper Dee Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying issues after the supply shut down the unfolding of the ambitious project.
All four of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class cruises, which the Navy ordered back in 2007, will replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
It is expected that they will include a powerful cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile batteries as well as stealth technologies, such as acoustic signatures, infrared and reduced radar.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the newest frigates can be deployed for up to two years away from home ports.
However, repeated delays mean that the innovative ships – which are supposed to allow Germany to send troops overseas – will become obsolete by the time they enter service, Dee Zeit noted.
The unfortunate frigate F125 made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after its delivery.
Not much is known about the reasons behind the recall, but German media cited a number of critical "software and hardware deficiencies" that made the warship useless for use in combat missions.
The software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class naval vessels would be operated by about 120 sailors - about half of the crew used in the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it was discovered that the ship has a dramatic excess weight that reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The ship Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons and is twice as heavy as ships of a similar type used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the faulty software, the price tag of the entire project – which also includes the team training – is also becoming a problem.
It has reportedly reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) – beyond the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that fascinate the newest frigates are becoming especially important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Security Committee of the German Parliament, confirmed that today, the Navy "is running out of ships capable of carrying out deployment".
The official source said the problem gained momentum and increased over time, as old ships were decommissioned but not replaced by other vessels.
He expressed his regret that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate could be attached to the Navy.
The National Trust of Scotland listens to the secret life of bats
A new study conducted on a mansion in the Highlands of Scotland aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt their food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The research done by scientists at the National Trust of Scotland will follow common bats and European kites as well as the brown and long-eared Dubenton bats at Inberio Gardens in Worcester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key sites around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
The National Health Service (NHS) staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using manual detectors.
A specialized sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequencies of the bat readings and which of the species is responsible for them.
Next, a map of the living areas will be drawn to create a detailed picture on the order of the landscape, of their patterns of behavior.
Rob Dower, a conservation consultant for the National Trust of Scotland (NTS) hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of living areas management work, such as creating meadows and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom were significantly reduced during the previous century.
They are under threat from development and construction works, which affect the nesting and loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting may also pose a risk, and this is also true for fly traps and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, bat ears are more useful when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo detection technique to detect insects and identify obstacles to their flight path.
The NTS Foundation, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 760,000 acres of land all over the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has 10 skilled specialists, who regularly conduct surveys, nesting tests and sometimes rescue.
The organization also established the first and only reserve dedicated to bats at the T'Ribb estate in Damparis and Galway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate manager David Thompson said the estate was the ideal territory for them.
"Here in T'Ribb we have a great area for the bats," he said.
We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and all the appropriate living areas.
But many things are still unknown about the bats, so the work we do here and in other assets will help us understand more what they need to thrive."
He stressed the importance of testing for finding bats before carrying out maintenance work within the properties, as the unintentional destruction of a single populated nest could destroy up to 400 females and puppies, and may also destroy an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and killing, harassing and interfering with bats or the destruction of their nesting areas are prohibited by law.
Elizabeth Pearl, a Scottish clerk at the Bat Conservancy Foundation, encouraged the public to lend a shoulder and help.
She said: "We have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our species we just don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo dismisses rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him "fake news," and said people "want to promote themselves" through the use of his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which released the allegations.
The pioneer of Portugal and Juventus teams was accused of raping an American woman named Katherine Miorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
33-year-old Ronaldo turned to his 142 million Instagram followers on live video a few hours after the allegations were made and booed the Fake News reports.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said yesterday, fake news," said the actor who won the balloon d'Or five times.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and all is well," added the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they referred to as "inadmissible reporting on privacy concerns," Reuters reported.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the actor would seek damages for "moral damages in an amount consistent with the severity of the violation, and this is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident occurred allegedly in June 2009 in the suite of the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Miorga reportedly returned to the player's room and allegedly raped her, according to documents filed in the Clark County Courthouse in Nevada.
Muraga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her that he was a "good guy" at 99 percent who had failed at "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that they were consensual.
Miorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but that she subsequently agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "terrified by acts of revenge" and feared "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now interested in canceling the settlement as she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and moved this summer to Italian club Juventus in a deal worth  EUR 100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will regret forever' loss of automakers
Britain will "repent forever" if it loses its position as the world's leading automaker after Brexit, said UK business minister Greg Clark.
He added that Toyota UK's interview with the BBC, in which she said that if the UK left the EU without a deal it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Branston, near Derby, was "worrisome".
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could increase in jobs.
The Branston plant – which manufactures the Orris and Aventis models of Toyota – produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"From my point of view, if the UK exits without an agreement from the European Union at the end of March, we will see a cessation of production at our plant," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Brunston.
Other UK automakers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and how it will affect cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what automakers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just in time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes, from British suppliers and the rest of the European Union, for production of cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, border disruptions could occur, and sector officials say they could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
Toyota will not be able to hold more than one day worth of inventory at a factory in Derbyshire, says the company, and so production will be discontinued.
Clark said Theresa May's Checkers program, detailing Britain's future relationship with the EU, "is precisely calibrated to prevent these tests at the border."
"We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement possible, as I said, not only to enjoy success in the present, but also to take advantage of the opportunity," he said on the BBC Radio 4 program Today.
"The evidence from Toyota and other automakers is that the possibility of continuing the use of the successful supply chain array, which has been at our disposal to this day, is absolutely essential."
Toyota did not say how long the cessation of production would last, but in the longer term, it warned that the additional costs would hurt factory competitiveness and would eventually result in layoffs.
Peter Zubalaris, who has worked at Branston for 24 years, and serves as president of the Unite Association at the factory, said that union members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, if jobs are reduced, they will never be reinstated.
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, which many depend on, could "be postponed another week" as the battle for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump and Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The gossip in Washington has been on the question of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and jeopardize Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of carrying a wire to record the talks with Trump and getting the president impeached through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he arrived at the White House, and reportedly was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for Thursday with Trump, who was staying at the time of Rosenstein's arrival at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but at this point the meeting was postponed to prevent a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week into the allegations against Kavanaugh, and rebuffed the Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
In response to a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has yet been set for the meeting, it may take place this week, I can see a postponement for another week given what is happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'm always happy to update the press."
Some reporters will dispute this assertion: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the frequency of briefings was not due to dislike of the "position taken" of television reporters, although she said: "I will not deny the fact that they are taking a stand."
She then offered to increase the direct link between Trump and the press.
"The president holds more question-and-answer meetings than any president before him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We checked the numbers."
Press briefings will still be held, Sanders said, but "if the press has an opportunity to pose questions directly to the president of the United States, it's much better than talking to me.
We have tried to do this on many occasions, and you have seen that we have done it on many occasions over the past few weeks, and meetings that will allow talking to the President of the United States will replace press briefings."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences while visiting dignitaries.
His press conferences alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated the reason for this, in a release and at times strange to reporters gathered on the spot.
Health Minister writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland and addresses concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to the staff from the European Union, who are employed by the National Health Service of Scotland, to express the country's gratitude and request that they remain after Brexit.
Scottish MP Gene Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain's exit from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already pledged to meet the ownership of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralized public services.
Ms. Freeman wrote in her letter: "Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU regarding the exit continued, and it is moving towards the expected decisions in the fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this period can be very worrying for all of you.
That's why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contributions of each member of the team, regardless of their citizenship.
Fellows from all over the European Union and the world bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the healthcare service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here."
Cristion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
The backback from the University of Tennessee Tigers team, Christon Abercrombie, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury from a 31-27 loss on Saturday to the Vanderbilt University Commodores team, Mike Organ reported from the Tennessean.
Rod Reed, head coach of the University of Tennessee team, told reporters the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He went to the sidelines and just collapsed there," Reid said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines and then put him on a stretcher and took him for further examination.
A University of Tennessee official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been transferred for surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/ extent of the analysis" and the University of Tennessee is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is an athletic student and this is his first season with the University of Tennessee after a transfer from Illinois.
He participated in five total tackles before coming out of the game, raising his total of tackles this season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when buying properties in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when buying properties in the UK and the additional revenue will be used to help homeless people, according to the new Conservative plan.
The move will counteract Corbyn's move to attract new voters
Stamp tax increases will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects the tax to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of stamp tax when buying a property in the UK - the extra revenue will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move was seen as an attempt to counteract Jeremy Corbyn's move to attract young voters, with promises to provide cheaper housing and focus on high-income earners.
The stamp tax will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional revenue will strengthen the government's move to help those who are sleeping in difficult conditions.
The payment, which comes as an addition to the current stamp tax, including higher tax levels on secondary residence and real estate investments for rent – may reach three percent.
The Finance Ministry expects the measure to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new properties built in London are purchased by foreign residents, a condition that causes price increases and makes it difficult for people who first purchase a property to set foot on the housing ladder.
Many rich areas of the country – especially the capital – have become "ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp tax cut to help young people purchase a first home.
He accused large construction companies of expensive property prices, as they were taking land but not using it, and urged Ms. May to abandon the quotas on affordable homes and fix Britain's "housing exacerbation".
Corbyn announced a series of attractive reforms proposed in the housing sector, including rent control and a cessation of evictions "without blame".
He also wants to give councils greater power to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said that I would devote my term to the restoration of the British dream - the main thing of which is that life is supposed to be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right for people who do not reside in the UK, as well as companies based in foreign countries, to be able to purchase homes with the same ease as British residents who work hard.
The dream of becoming a householder has become too far away for too many people, and the humiliation of sleeping in difficult conditions is too realistic."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his "ultimate ambition" was to become the manager of Scotland at one point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman relishes the resuscitation challenge of the North East club, which is currently in third place in the First Division, three points away from the top of the rankings.
He moved to the Summer Light Stadium after leading St Mirren back to number one in Scotland last season.
I wanted to play for my country as an actor.
I once participated in an international game and that was it," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportsound.
But growing up, I watched the Scotland team play at Hampden a lot with my dad as a kid, and it was always something that pulled me back.
In any case, this opportunity will only come if I succeed in managing the team."
Former Sunderland executives include Dick Edbocket, David Moys, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Foye, and Paolo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alois Athletic says he was not afraid to come after such established names at such a large club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, success at the moment will be assessed according to the "Can I return the club to the Premier League?
Because of the structure and facilities in this club, there is no doubt that it belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I can only see myself as a success story here if I can get the club back there."
Ross began his management career just three years ago, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as team coach for Hearts.
He then helped Alois out of Liga C and raised St Mirren from the brink of the abyss to the title-winner position the following season.
Verus says he feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkerk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real junction," he recalled, regarding taking command of Alois.
"I truly believed that the management position suited me, more than the game.
It sounds strange because I played well, earned reasonably well, and enjoyed some reasonable records.
But an actor's career can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I still deal with them when it comes to stress and stress at work, but management just feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, and I've never felt more comfortable with myself as an adult."

The perfect time for a pint of beer is at 17:30 on Saturday, found in a survey
The summer heat wave increased profits of the British pubs struggling for their existence, but caused pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups of pubs and bars enjoyed an increase in sales at 2.7 percent in July – but restaurant revenue fell 4.8 percent, the data revealed.
Peter Martin, of CGA Business Consulting, who compiled the data, said: "The significance of the continued bright weather and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Championships is that the month of July had a similar pattern to that of June, in that pub revenues increased 2.8 percent, but the restaurants suffered an even harder blow.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant trade observed in June only worsened in July.
Drink-focused pubs and bars recorded the strongest performance, with higher growth from the decline in revenue in the restaurant business, compared to the previous period.
Food-focused pubs also suffered from the sun, although their condition was less dramatic than that of restaurant operators.
People just seem to want to go out for a drink.
Among pub and bar chains, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent over the month, and food sales rates fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, of RSM Data Analysis for Leisure and Hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since late April.
The weather and the impact of sporting events or important social events are the most important factors when it comes to the outdoor recreation market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, though a 4.8 percent decline in sales compared to last year would be particularly painful in addition to all the constant cost pressures.
The long, hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-focused businesses, and time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring a respite to what they need so much."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand launches.
The sales monitoring factor for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector, Copper Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 groups, with an integrated business cycle exceeding 9 billion pounds, and is the benchmarking measure set in the sector.
One out of every five children has social media accounts they hide from their parents.
A survey revealed that one in five children – some just 11 years old – have secret social media accounts they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey, involving 20,000 middle school students, revealed an increase in fake Insta pages.
The news raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20 percent of students said they had a "primary" account which they show to parents
One in five children – some just 11 years old – creates accounts on social media that he keeps secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts – as a reference to the photo-sharing website, Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they were running a clean "primary" account to show their parents, but that they also had private accounts.
A mother who ran into her 13-year-old teenage daughter's secret account found she was asking others to "rape me."
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Association (HMC) of the UK found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles and half of them admit to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Bocanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Aileed Doyle will serve as a "voice for athletes" on the board of Scottish athletes
Aylid Doyle was elected to the Board of Scottish Athletes as an external director at the annual General Assembly of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most decorated light athletic athlete and chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those who guide sports to benefit from her rich international experience over the past decade.
"Aylid has received great respect from the Scottish, British and global athletes community and we are confident that the Scottish athletes will benefit immensely from bringing you to the board," Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I am passionate about serving as a voice for athletes and hope that I can truly contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, and four Olympic gold medals in total, and is now regularly used as a commentator on the BBC, has lost his ability to walk after suffering a transient stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time will tell if I will recover or to what extent.
It was a drudgery, but I recovered completely, relearned how to walk and is currently performing speed and response exercises!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!"
Advertising ad for milk pumps comparing mothers to online opinion party cows
A dairy pump company split opinions online with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of the pump that is supposed to be the world's first "silent and wearable milk pump", technology company Elvie released a humorous video ad to demonstrate the freedom of action that the new pump gives to mothers.
Four real mothers dancing in a hay-filled cow barn to a song that included words like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed it's not udders, it's my breasts."
The song's chorus goes on to say: "I'm pumping, I'm feeding the babies, I'm pumping, I'm milking my girls."
But the ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of responses, the video received mixed responses from viewers, and many said it sheds light on the "horror" of the dairy industry.
A very poor decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they too need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them within a few days of giving birth," she wrote.
Elvie's milk pump discreetly fits inside a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment said: "Traumatically understandable to the cow and the calf alike.
But hey, why not use them to advertise a milk pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?"
Another comment said: "Advertisement is completely disconnected".
Others defended the commercial, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was "laugh-ripping".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
The pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy but I've been referring to its content.
It's a genius product," wrote someone.
Another comment said: It's a funny advertisement for mothers who suck (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows".
This is not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women discovers that they have all danced with the discreet pumps inside their bras.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women, who use a milk pump, say they feel like cows.
But Elvie's pump is completely quiet, without pipes and wires, it discreetly fits into the breast-feeding bra and gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out while pumping.
Anna Bellarin, a partner and in charge of the Early Childhood Development Department at Mother commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing self-expression women and milking cows, we wanted to place the milk pumping and all the challenges it has in the spotlight, and to demonstrate in an entertaining way, with which one can identify, the amazing sense of freedom that the new pump will give.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the runway for designer Martha Jacobowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly transported to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children in custody has soared despite the fact that the number of monthly border crossings remains relatively unchanged, and one of the reasons is that the Trump administration's discourse and policies have made it difficult to transfer the children to sponsors.
Generally, most sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and were afraid to risk their ability to remain in the country applying for child liability.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult household members would have to hand over fingerprints, and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior immigration and throne official, testified to Congress that the PA had arrested dozens of people who had applied for child sponsorship without supervision.
The Authority subsequently confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of sponsors or household members are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are criminals from foreign countries.
That is why we continue to pursue these people," said Mr. Albans.
In order to address solutions for the children more quickly, officials introduced new laws that would require some of them to appear before a court within a month of their arrest, rather than after 60 days as was customary under previous regulations, shelter workers reported.
Many will appear via video conferencing, instead of face-to-face, to present their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not found eligible for release will be deported quickly.
The longer these children remain under cover, the more likely they are to develop anxiety and depression, and this could lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, the shelter workers said, and reports that have been published from the system in recent months.
Consultants say these concerns are intensifying in larger facilities like Tornillo, where signs of a child's difficulties are likely to be neglected, due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving the children to a tent city without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or break up with friends could exacerbate the trauma many are already dealing with.
Syria tells U.S., French and Turkish 'occupation forces' to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext that they are fighting terrorism, and will be "treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the rally.
Mualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we purge the Syrian lands" of the terrorist organizations and "any illegal foreign presence" alike.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising the Kurdish and Syrian forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 fighters on the war-torn soil of the country.
When it came to the refugee issue, Mualem said the conditions for their return were good and accused "certain Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to assist in their return," he said.
They're politicizing an issue that's supposed to be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be sent to rebuild Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel outpost, has created an opportunity for progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces with the support of the Russians on the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would focus on jihad fighters, including fighters from the victory front linked to the al-Qaeda organization, who would be "destroyed".
U.N. envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes to convene first meetings of a new committee, which will consist of members of government and opposition, to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Mualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited to "examining the provisions of the current constitution," and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win second term
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers obviously hope, impeachment and scandal will end his presidency before its time.
In a move that will no doubt be "the most dramatic finale in the history of the presidency of all time"!
Currently, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, peak viewing rates have increased by more than double, reaching 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers at peak hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC-broadcasted "Rachel Meadow Show" reached the top of cable ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers on important news evenings.
"It's the fire people are drawn to because it's not something we understand," said Neil Burr, executive producer of the ABC drama series, The Destined Survivor, which deals with a secretary of state who becomes president after an attack destroys the capital.
Nell Scoble, a longtime comedy writer and author of "Only the Funny Parts: ...and Some Hard Truths About Infiltration into the Hollywood Men's Circle" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
She asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh'," Ms. Scoble told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike all other television shows, the storylines coming out of Washington may determine the future of the Ru v. Wade verdict, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Channel switching or ignoring is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you are exceeding the limits of being an informed citizen when you find yourself watching for six hours on a panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used a "secret informant" as a source for Fear, a $15,000 ostrich Bobbers jacket by Paul Manafort and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' appalling descriptions of, and forgiveness for, the phrase, Trump's anatomy.
I, for one, would never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does, which gives a feeling similar to that of a reality show, is that he feeds you something every night," said Brett Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show "History for Sale", about the team switching to the Trump show and the daily twists in the plot (the war with the NFL, the praise for Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to lose one chapter or you'll be left behind.
When I got to Mr. Place this week, it was bright outside with a temperature of about 26 degrees on the north coast of Kauai Island, but he shut down to watch MSNBC, and recorded CNN simultaneously.
He was unable to disengage, not as Brett Cavanaugh was preparing to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Place told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Finances from outside sources flood the race for the closest midterm election Congress
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district faces a flood of funds, thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts, which resulted in a two-member congressional race for the same seat.
The district, a suburb of Pittsburgh whose borders were recently redrawn, placed Democratic Representative Connor Lamb – who won his seat in another district, in a special election last spring.
Lamb ran against another congressman, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district, which largely overlaps with the boundaries of the new 17th congressional district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the division of former counties discriminated against, and unconstitutionally, the results in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a financial blowout battle in the campaign between the major parties' financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March special election, widely watched, for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat belonged to Republicans for over a decade, and President Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators expected a slight advantage for the Democrats.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, and withdrew afterwards.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with slight opposition from Washington.
Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump management team.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of the American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in response to "the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nevert, a spokeswoman for the ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
But the imposition of penalties was only considered against El Salvador, which was believed to have received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, which included drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in economic aid and targeted restrictions on visas, could have hurt a Central American country suffering from high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials rejected an urgent conference that was supposed to focus on safety and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar conference last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials made clear their desire to promote the conference, ending all punitive considerations against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference participants, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, as a symbol of the importance the administration attaches to him, the diplomats said.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal discussions, provided they remain anonymous.
Their explanations were corroborated by an outside analyst, close to the administration, who also spoke anonymously.
Studying History
The next obvious thing may come from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's alleged obstruction of justice, for which there is now substantial evidence in public records.
Mueller is reportedly directing his investigation into whether Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia on its attacks on our election campaign.
If control of Congress changes, Trump will find himself accountable to that body, just as he is preparing to stand up to the voters again, and possibly a jury.
There are a lot of questions here that begin with an "if" and I am not going to argue that Trump's downfall is inevitable - not even those of his equivalent European officials.
On both sides of the Atlantic, all of us must make choices that will affect the length of time that may last.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup against Hitler, if only the West had opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to prevent the years of carnage that occurred as a result.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the march of democracy that cannot be stopped, accelerated, or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this paper reported that last year he had offered to secretly record the president and speculated about his inadequacy to the presidency.
Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
How will we respond if the recently requested F.B.I. investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair – or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections and appoint a Congress to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will go into a long winter nap.
But I believe we won't fail, because of the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime who had also occupied the luxurious house I once owned.
She survived, immigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light Shabbat candles on the same table that bears the swastika.
With such a legacy, how could I not be optimistic about the future?"
Norman Eisen, senior partner at Brookings Institute, is chairman of the nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, D.C. and author of The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House.
Graham Durance of the Rangers is optimistic about the Braffyd Vienna debate.
The Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and know that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, will place them in a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Durance from appearing for the first time in the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers could use this result as a stepping stone to better performance.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good team," said the 31-year-old footballer.
We went out into the game believing we could accomplish something and we got a point.
We might have won in the end but, overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we got out of the stalemate in the second half and we were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points but it'll be a tough game because they got a good result in their last game, but with the crowd behind us, I'm convinced we can push and get a positive result.
The past year has been really hard, with everything that's happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but there's a good feeling about the place now.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, put the last season behind and succeed.
Women stay awake because of this fear about pension savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, only a few people talk about it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they were talking to their partners about the cost of long-term nursing care.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to have the conversation," said Holly Schneider, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance Company.
This can be done in the following way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You won't be able to prepare the family for treatment if you don't express your wishes long before the deadline.
Use your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get treatment, as these choices may be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Involve your financial advisor: The consultant will also be able to assist you in finding a way to pay for the expenses.
Your long-term long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a sum of money to help cover expenses, or self-insurance with your capital – as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal documents: Find an early solution to legal struggles on this occasion.
Find and appoint a health care provider, a trusted person who will oversee your health care and make sure that professionals fulfill your wishes in case you can't communicate.
Also consider signing a power of attorney when it comes to your finances.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions in your place and ensure payment of bills if you are not qualified.
Don't forget the details: Imagine your adult parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications or allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
"The financial side is not the only important point, but also who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare the plan."
A man has been shot several times with an air rifle in Ilpercombe.
A man was shot several times with air saturation as he walked home from a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilpercombe, Devon when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 2:30 p.m., according to British summer time, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the person who attacked him.
The injuries he suffers from are not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The disaster caused the disengagement of the communications networks and the officials responsible for the aid could not receive information from Dongala Province, an area in northern Palo that was closer to the source of the 7.5-strong noise.
In Palo, over 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster struck.
Here are some facts about Palo and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palo is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located on the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017, according to estimates.
The city marked its 40th anniversary when the tsunami wave and earthquake hit it.
Dongala is a district extending over 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The population in the province, an administrative area within the province, was estimated to be 299,200 in 2017.
The main sources of income in the province's economy are fishing and agriculture, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
Another important source of income is nickel mining, which is mainly concentrated in Morvali, on the coast on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palo and Dongala have been hit several times by waves of tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami wave also hit Western Dongala in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire region, known for its seismic activity and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra, on 26 December, caused a tsunami wave that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, and over half of those killed died in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nyas, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island and caused a tsunami wave that shattered on the southern coast killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the area near the city of Padang, the provincial capital of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mantawai Islands, in front of Sumatra, causing a tsunami wave up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake struck the Fidi Jaya district of Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as local people recalled the post-earthquake devastation and deadly tsunami wave in 2004.
The earthquake did not cause a tsunami in this case, but over 100 people were killed from collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, killing over 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on family violence charge
Truck Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, Alaska's governor and former vice-presidential candidate, was arrested on assault charges.
The 29-year-old Palin from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaskan police.
According to the police report, when a miner tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her.
Palin is being held in custody at the Matt-So-Pertreal facility under a $500 self-guarantee, according to a report by KTUU television channel.
According to network reports, he appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, for sure", when asked to flatten his claims.
Palin is charged with three Class A conduct offences and may, therefore, be jailed for a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B conduct offense, according to which he can be sentenced to a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting a crime of domestic violence, and possession of firearms under intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he punched her in the face.
Groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami wave and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.5, caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications networks have been cut and the loss rate is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck close to the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos, distributed on social networks, show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate at a beach festival in the city of Palo when the tsunami wave shattered on the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sippolo Saipov, suspected of the New York City terror attack that killed eight people - a rare punishment that has not been carried out for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented home depot truck to carry out a bike-track attack alongside the West Side Highway in southern Manhattan, and ran over pedestrians and cyclists who got in his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov deliberately killed the eight victims and caused serious body injuries, according to the intent statement for the death penalty application, filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court's document, the death penalty may be sought on these two counts.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury slapped Sipov with a charge of 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in aid of extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "significant planning in advance and deliberately first," prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov carried out the attack as "humiliating, cruel and sickly."
"Saipolo Habibulevich Saifov has caused harm, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Calaves, Ann-Laur Decid, Darren Drake, Ariel Arlig, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Paniko," the statement read.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the Southern District of New York sued for the death penalty in a case occurred a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after their conviction in a conspiracy for espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not express remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He stated to investigators that he felt good about his actions, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to police, he also asked to hang an ISIS flag in the hospital room where he was staying.
He claimed he was innocent in response to the 22-count indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal defense attorneys representing Saipov, said they were "disappointed of course" by the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting an admission of guilt that would lead to life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the duration of the trauma of these events on all those involved," Patton said.
Seipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Prague should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Prague vowed to ‘enlist the People's Army’ today during a protest at the Conservatives' Conference.
The former leader of the UKIP party said politicians must "feel pressure" from the Eurosceptics - when an MP from Theresa May's Conservative Party claimed to be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Boone said at a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom was "already out" at this point if Prague were to serve as secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge facing May, the reconciliation of the highly divided ranks of conservatives, was highlighted by the joining of conservatives who support remaining in the European Union for a different demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to leave her compromise plan, the Checkers, in its way despite attacks by Brexit supporters, supporters of the EU and the EU.
The allies insisted that she would continue to try and reach an agreement with Brussels despite the counter-reactions – forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour Party to choose between her agreement and ‘chaos,'" he said.
Boone said at a meeting of the Leave Means Leave group in Solihull that he wanted to "break up with Chequers".
He claimed that Farage had to be accepted as a member and be in charge of the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
MP from Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit but we need to say goodbye to the Hooks.
He stressed his opposition to the European Union and said: "We didn't fight both world wars to be enslaved.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Boone dismissed the claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false."
Conservative MP and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins was also on the march and told reporters: "I say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Checkers program is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists who took to the streets and elected us in the first place.
Please, ditch the checkers and start listening."
In a critical statement directed at May, she added: "Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Prague said at the conference that politicians should be made to "feel the pressure" if they are going to betray a resolution passed in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a question of trust that exists between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'We won't let you get away with it'.
He added, in a message to the enthusiastic audience: "I want you to make our political standing, which is about to betray Brexit, feel pressured.
"We call upon the People's Army of this country, which has given us the victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain."
At that moment, the remaining supporters marched in Birmingham and then held a two-hour convention downtown.
A handful of activists waved ‘conservatives against Brexit’ banners after forming the group over the weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis ridiculed the opening of the Conservatives' conference on the security issues they suffered with the party app.
"These are people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the possible technology for an agreement like Canada Plus, for border crossing without friction and for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's completely ridiculous.
There is no such thing as a "good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to 'seriously consider' running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a meeting at a city hall in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for midterm elections in November against Republican Jeff Dill, who served as co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of rumors that she may be running against Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke, which took place Saturday afternoon, is the 36th meeting that has been held with voters in a meeting format in the City Hall since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time "for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government and for a woman to head."
Arrest in Sims's shooting-to-death case from LSU
Police in Louisiana's capital, Baton Rouge, announced Saturday that the suspect in the shooting who killed LSU basketball player Wade Simms was arrested on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson during a press conference at 11 a.m. held by ET.
Police released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
20-year-old Simms was shot and killed near the University of Southern campus early on Friday.
"Wade Simms suffered a gunshot wound to his head and eventually disposed of it," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, as reported by 247sports.
Wade tried to protect a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being in possession of a weapon and singing at Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the Eastern District Police of Baton Rouge.
The nearly six-foot-tall junior player played in 32 games with 10 starts in the last season and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton finishes with a world title after team rankings gave him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear, from the moment Waltery Bottas qualified for the next level ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, that Mercedes team rankings would play an important role in the race.
From the first moment, Butas had a good start and left Hamilton almost alone as he defended his place in the first two rounds and invited Wattle to attack his teammate.
Wattle went to the intermediary stop first and let Hamilton integrate into the movement of the competitors' tail, a likely crucial decision.
The Mercedes team set off for a round stop later and returned to the race behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after a tight wheel fight at the end of which the Ferrari driver had to leave the inside track to hold out without risk after a double play in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back row of the rankings and was seventh at the end of the first round.
He then led for much of the race and did not change tires to achieve a quick finish and overtake Kimi Rykonen for fourth place.
He eventually dropped to a stopover in the 44th round and failed to step up the pace in the remaining eight rounds as Riknen took fourth place.
It's a tough day because Waltery did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me get around him.
The team has done an extraordinary job to get to Double," Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at the conference on Saturday in connection with her insistence that she not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Brett Cavanaugh of being the Supreme Court nominee, of sexual assault.
While speaking at a conference in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "bad and mean and liars".
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see angry and bad and mean people and liars," he said.
"When you look at publications and leaks and then they say 'Oh, I didn't do that.'
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you leaked?
Remember her answer-- did you leak the document-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
So, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't," he added, mimicking the senator.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford detailing the charges against Kavanaugh as early as July, and he was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill newspaper.
"She asked me to keep his secret and I kept the secret of the letter as she asked me to."
But the senatorial denial did not seem to be accepted by the president, who responded to it during the conference on Saturday evening: "I'm telling you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe it's not [the leak], but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, and claimed that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return to power at all costs.
You see the convictions, the villains, they don't care who they hurt, who they run over on the road to power and power," said the president, according to a report by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee stars in 5-3 against Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee stars made up for their loss in the Premier League on Friday against the Belfast Giants and won the next game 5-3, at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had an early lead from two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis at Villiers.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney put their team back in business until Dwyer regained the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard tied for the Dandens until two of Lucas Landwald Nielsen's goals secured the victory.
This is the third loss of the season in an elite league for Adam Keefe's team, which emerged from behind to defeat the Danes 2-1 in Belfast, on Friday.
This is the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants have won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 p.m. from Kendall McFaul's cooking, and David Rothford cooked the goal for Bevelier as he doubled the score four minutes later.
In an active first third, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 13:10 until Matt Marquardt cooked the equal goal for Cooney at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead on the first break when he scored his second goal in the evening, at the end of the first period.
The home team was regrouped and Bouchard again scored a goal that equalised the power play at 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran combined forces to help Nielsen give the Dundee an advantage for the first time in the game, at the end of the second period, and Nielsen secured the Dundee victory with the fifth goal, which he scored from half the field in the final third.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes on their home field in the next game on Friday.
An aviation inspector gave his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on the plane could escape an earthquake.
An Indonesian aviation inspector has been hailed as a hero after sacrificing his life to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers takes off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a powerful earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday and caused a tsunami wave.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palo.
But although many of his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gennavan Agung refused to abandon his position, in a strongly swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Joffrey Airport in Palu.
He remained in place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321 could take off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower thinking he was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Nivigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Searight said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from the airport in Alicante, Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palo.
"Our hearts are broken at the news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands as, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, access to Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll will continue to rise as many bodies are still buried under the rubble and access to many others is not possible," said agency spokesman Satofu Furev.
Waves up to six meters high destroyed Palo and the city will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and equipment.
Risa Kosuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances bring bodies every minute.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-mart stores are looted everywhere."
Yann Gelfand, who heads the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working quickly to help the survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but the situation could get even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's soldiers: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, in which over 550 people were killed.
Plane crashes in Micronesia: Air New Guinea company says one man is missing after plane crash in Laguna
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person was missing, having previously stated that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a statement that beginning in the afternoon on Saturday, it was not possible to say what had become of one passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try and find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or citizenship.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water, while attempting to land at Chuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone who remained was in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in Laguna a short distance from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had reached a very low orbit.
"It's a very positive thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to make their way to the emergency exits in waist-high water on the sinking plane.
He said that the crew of the plane was nervous and screaming, and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on improving a pier also helped with rescue operations, using an inflatable boat that brought people ashore before the plane sank in water about 30 metres (100 ft) deep.
Air Safety Network (ASN) data states that 111 people have been killed in airline crashes registered in Papua New Guinea in the past two decades, but Air New Guinea has not been involved in any of these incidents.
Analyst details the course of events on the night a woman was burned alive
The lawsuit proved its case on Saturday, in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rwalt of the U.S. Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the defendant's movements, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim's movements, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night she was murdered.
According to the Clarion Ledger report, Rwalt said he had received the location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tallis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his earlier claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went out to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was with Sanford that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was that Tallis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicated they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Talis deleted Chambers' text messages, conversations, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing speech on Sunday, as planned.
The judge said he expected the trial to be moved to jury deliberation later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative opinion of the genre and fills its music with positive messages.
The High Breed Trio of Bristol claims that hip hop has distanced itself from its sources as a tool for expressing political messages and attacking social issues.
They want to get back to its roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as the Fugees and Common have recently been revived in the UK through artists such as Akala and Laoki.
Another black man?
New York nanny sues couple for dismissal after ‘racist’ text message
A New York City therapist is suing a couple for being fired on grounds of discrimination after receiving a text message that was not intended for her from the mother who complained that the nanny was "another black person".
The couple denied he was racist and compared the lawsuit to "blackmail".
Lynsey Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she found out that her new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black when she reached her first day of work in 2016.
"Noaaaaah another black man," Ms. Plasco-Flexman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
According to a report by the New York Post, after noticing the ejaculation, Flasco-Flexman fired Ms. Morris, saying that the previous nanny, who was of African American descent, had done a poor job, and that she now expected to hire a Filipino instead.
Mrs. Morris was paid for one day's work and sent home with Uber.
Now, Morris is suing the couple for dismissal, asking for $350 a day compensation for six months of work and living in a place for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that sort of thing," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple fought back on claims that they were racists, saying that ending Morris' employment was requested, out of fear that they would not be able to trust her after she was hit.
My wife sent her something she wasn't going to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But is your child's role in the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was by accident?
Your soft baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "blackmail" and said his wife was due to give birth just two months before the event and was "in a very difficult situation".
Do you want to chase someone like her?
It is not nice to do such a thing," added the investment banker.
The legal case is still in progress, but the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, killing their behavior and the arguments they used.
New letter reveals Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn't identify with a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine yourself in the place of someone reading the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very amusing to know now what we know about Paddington's tremendous success."
After saying that her father, who worked for the BBC as a photographer before being inspired to write the children's book from a small toy bear, would become bloodthirsty about rejecting his work, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "sweet bitter" after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of Paddington's eventual success, which she described as "a very important member of our family."
"He was a quiet man, not an arrogant man," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who accomplished something: you're proud of him even though it's not really because of you.
I think he saw Paddington's success sort of like that.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always said it was because of Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello to her on the phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Ned called on a regular basis and said she was in really bad shape, that she was not expected to last," Mrs. Adnan-Lafros said.
Then I got a call from Ned saying that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I should say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were slowly gone and out of her system.
She died sometime before and it was over, it all stopped.
All I could do was sit there and wait, knowing that it was all happening.
I couldn't whine or scream or cry because I was surrounded right now by families and people.
I really had to hold on."
Eventually, Mrs. Adnan-Lafros, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane alongside other passengers, unaware of her ordeal.
No one knew," she said.
My head was hunched over, and tears were pouring all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had this overwhelming sense of identification with Ned.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women Hanging Grief Postcards on Bridge to Prevent Suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide, are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries hung postcards on a bridge in Welsh with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people could call to get support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don't want any other parent to feel the way I do every day," she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Ladney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone recognized him for his smile.
They always said his smile lit up every room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after committing suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly afraid of a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis created the postcards, "so that people would know there was someone to turn to and talk to, even if it was a friend.
Don't sit still - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphries, Ms. Davis' friend for years, lost Mark, a life partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling down or depressed or anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was at rock bottom on Christmas Day – when the kids opened the presents he didn't make eye contact with them or anything like that."
She said that his death was a tremendous trauma for them, but that they overcame it: "It creates a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting."

Burt Cavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought, if we could really get what he asked for - a time-limited and scale-limited investigation - we might be able to bring a little bit to the merge," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "stretched to shreds" in the entrenched partisan deadlock.
Why were Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not interested in an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance stems entirely from the timing.
The midterm elections will be held in just five weeks, on November 6th, and if, as expected, the Republicans do not succeed in them, they will be greatly weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators to lobby them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI pulls out its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to receive at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors 'going down' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byung-sig, citing data from the South Korean Union Office, said the number of defections last year was 1,127, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were the stricter border controls between North Korea and China and an increase in the amounts charged by the people's smugglers.
Pyongyang did not make a public statement.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, with which North Korea has the longest border and which is easier to cross compared to the well-preserved military zone (DMZ) between the two countries.
China treats deserters as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are technically still at war – have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the stalled negotiations on nuclear disarmament issues.
The meeting took place after the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which the two generally agreed to act towards an era in which the Korean peninsula would not possess nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and in such circumstances, there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a "histerical", and says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate "hysterical" and said his character does not allow him to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi responded to this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever appeared like that, they would have said 'histerical'," Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh vehemently rejected the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes almost screamed and choked when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly denounced Democrats on the committee and called the arguments against him a "coordinated and grotesque character assassination" organized because of the liberals' anger at Hillary Clinton losing the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved unable to serve on the Supreme Court because it showed bias against the Democrats.
"I think he recused himself with these statements and the way he pursued the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if his nomination was approved, and if Democrats would win a majority in the House.
"I'll put it this way -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI then he's not right, not just for a Supreme Court term, but for the court he's currently in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge in the District of Columbia Federal Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she has concerns about possible rulings by Kavanaugh against Obama's health care reform or the Roe v. Wade ruling, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh evaded questions about the possibility of dismissing certain Supreme Court decisions.
"There is no reason for a hysterical and biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that great,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
This is a harsh criticism, months and years of rage overflowing, and she can't express them without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's uncommon, do I?"
She went on, "I got a lot of help from a woman who used to run somewhere else, who said she was crying too when she got mad, but she developed a technique and every time she got mad and started crying, she used to tell the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are given privileges as an outlet for rage, in part because they are not understood in essence.
One of my most significant memories of a job early in my life, in an office with a male majority, is that I once found myself crying with unspeakable rage, and an older woman grabbed my back, it was a cool manager from whom I had always been a little afraid – and dragged me to the stairwell.
"Don't let them see you ever cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they've managed to get you down."
Patricia Schroeder, who was a Colorado congresswoman at the time, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business and emerged from the race, Schroeder, who was deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason for her not to consider the idea of running for the presidency herself.
"It wasn't a decision I thought well about," she told me 30 years later and laughed.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another contender.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because she joined the campaign late, she was behind in fundraising, so she vowed not to join the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
At the time of her speech announcing that she would not start an official campaign, the feelings overwhelmed her so much – gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and focus on voters instead of representatives, and anger at sexual discrimination – she was choked with tears.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Schroeder in the way the press reacted to her.
"You'd think I'd been sponsored by Clenx.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my tombstone?
"She cried"?
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening salvos of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a rift between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the opening shot earlier this year when he levied a tax on important Chinese exports including solar, steel and aluminum collectors.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods ($150 million), imposing taxes on virtually half of the goods imported to the U.S. from China.
Beijing responded with the same coin each time, and recently raised rates by five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to strike back on every blow by the United States, and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will surrender in the near future.
A request from Washington to retract would mean a capitulation to its demands, but a public bow to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing succeeds in getting things right, the pressures from the trade war with the U.S. may positively support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of an economic spiral in each of the countries is actually much more dangerous than previously expected," said Abigail Grace, a research partner focused on Asia, in the New American Security think tank.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for aid to rebuild the country that has been destroyed in a long war that has lasted for over seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said the conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the war on terror," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to restore the situation to normal.
All conditions now exist for the return of refugees of their own free will to the country they left because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures, aimed at harming their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to UN estimates, over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Muallem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that the regime would not receive conditional aid or assistance from countries that funded the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 - 10.5 at the La Golf National track outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has so far lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points it needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Michaelson, who struggled for almost the entire tournament, sent his T-string into the water on the 16th hole of Par-3, losing the game against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has polished all his rounds, becoming one of the four players to reach 5-0-0 since the start of the tournament in the current formation, in 1979.
American player Jordan Spith was defeated 5th and 4th by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olsen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the top ranked player in the world, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Falter, which may be the last time he will play in the Ryder Cup.
With a record eight participations in the Ryder Cup, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the European player with the highest number of wins in tournaments with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry but today I can't resist.
It's been a tough year.
So I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have the trophy back.
It's a team, and I'm glad I could help," Garcia said excitedly after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in the singles game on Sunday.
"The tremendous pride I feel, defeating Tiger Woods, which I watched growing up," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four games in France and his record now stands at 13-21-3, peaking at the Ryder Cup in his career.
This is odd statistics from one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 important titles, with only Jack Nicklaus in front of him.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find its way through the lawns, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Pineau who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Team captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We failed.
Good for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American Professional Golf Association and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
The hat needs to be taken off.
We've been defeated."
