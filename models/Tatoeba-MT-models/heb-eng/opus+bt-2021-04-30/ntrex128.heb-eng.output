MPs in Wales are afraid to look like Muppets"
Some MPs were alarmed by the proposal that their title would change from AM to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Party).
This concern arose following plans to rename the deleted house to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of Parliament at all political arch are concerned that this will invite ridicule.
One Labour MP said his people were afraid that "it would rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
An MP from the ÇFleid Camari Party said that all his friends were "unsatisfied" and offered alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his members were "open to suggestions" about the name change, but noted that the name MWP (the initials of the Welsh MP) sounded very similar to the word "Muppet" (a Muppet doll).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is expressed in a similar manner to the expression of the letter u in English in the Yorkshire accent.
The Legislative Committee, which is currently drafting the legislation for naming changes, said "The final decision regarding any descriptive words as to the names of members of the legislature is of course the decision of members of the legislature themselves."
The 2017 Wales Government Act granted the Welsh legislature the authority to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of the consultation with the public on the proposals, in which broad support was given to change the name of the legislature to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the role of members of Parliament (AMs), the committee recommended Ç Members of the Welsh Parliament" or WMPs, but the MWP option received most support in consultation with the public.
Members of Parliament offer alternative options, but the struggle to achieve consensus may cause quite a bit of a headache to the committee's chairman, Elin G. Jones, who should be filing a legislative draft regarding the changes in the coming weeks.
The legislation regarding reforms will include other changes in the legislature's working manner, including rules for excluding MPs and the structure of the committee system.
Members of Parliament's vote is to eventually determine their role title when discussing legislation.
The citizens of Macedonia go to polls in a referendum on changing the country's name
The citizens will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country name to: The Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was set in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, in which a district called Macedonia existed.
Greece claimed for a long time that a name called Conscience was a claim to Greece's territory and repeated and opposed Macedonia's attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, George : Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore his results.
However, those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaib, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in the Harlem neighborhood.
According to Mr. Adams, “old neighborhood residents say there used to be a bar and church in every corner.
"Now there are no bars or churches."
He says the disappearances of bars can be understood.
"People's social life today is going differently," he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood living room where people visit on a regular basis."
Regarding churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not survive as long as the church heads expect, “and sooner or later, they will find themselves again at the starting point.
He said the churches would take place in apartment buildings with condominiums that inhabit people who are not the kind to help the neighborhoods maintain the unique characteristic.
“ The vast majority of people who purchase apartments in these buildings will be white people, ” he said, “and therefore this will speed up the closure of these churches, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will join these churches."
The two churches were built by parishes of believers to build, before Harlem became a neighborhood that most of its inhabitants were black – the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The White Methodist community left in the 1930s.
A black parish of believers operating in the area became the owner of the structure.
St. Martin's Church passed into the hands of a black parish of believers under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott on 125th Street merchants, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused heavy damage to the structure, but as part of the plans of the believers under Reverend Johnson to rebuild it, they commissioned the construction of the bell caroon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Johnson Sr. and the one who inherited his place at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the "Bells of the Poor".
The expert who played on the career in July called him a different name: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical tool".
The expert, Tiffany Ing of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first bluebell cryon to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who later played on the larger crion at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriwether said St. Martin's Church didn't replace him.
What took place at St. Martin's Church over the past few months was a complex story of architects and contractors, some of which were brought in by the heads of the local church, and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The meeting – which is the governing body of a community of believers composed of local believers – wrote to the Diocese in July a letter in which she deploys her concerns that the diocese would “try to roll the costs" to the meeting, although the meeting was not involved in recruiting the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some believers complained of the absence of transparency from the diocese.
Shark wound 13-year-old boy diving for lobster.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as the boy plunged to catch lobsters in California on the first day of lobster season, so officials delivered.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hummel told the KSWB-TV network in San Diego that he had been diving with friends from about an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy crying out for help and then rowed there with a group to help lure him to the beach.
Hummel initially thought that these were just enthusiastic shouts about the catch of a lobster, but then realized that the boy was yelling: “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
Hummel said that as he approached the boy he saw that "his entire collarbone had been ripped off."
"I shouted for everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!", Hummel added.
The boy was flown to Radi Hospital in San Diego where his condition is defined as manos.
It's unknown what kind of shark attacked the boy.
Rescue chief Larry Giles said in a press briefing that Shark had been identified in the area just weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous genus shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Authorities closed access to the coast between Ponto Beach in Kasvalad and Swami Beach in Asinitas for 48 hours for interrogation and safety purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to infiltrate the UK beauty products market
Sainsbury's starts competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and opens department store style passes with professional saleswomen.
As part of a significant venture to infiltrate the UK beauty products market that rolls 2.8 billion sterling a year, and which continues to increase while sales in fashion and products areas for the decline, the extended aisles of beauty products will be inspected in eleven stores across the country and if the experiment succeeds, will be added to additional stores next year.
The investment in beauty products comes as supermarkets search for ways to use shelves previously seized by televisions, microwaves and household products.
From Sainsbury's it is reported that the company is expected to double its beauty products supply up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweiserman and Dr. Paw Paw Paw Paw for the first time in its history.
Existing product lines of L'Oreal companies, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be awarded additional territory with dedicated brand areas similar to those that exist in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket chain also relaunches its makeup product line—Boutique—so that most products will be vegan-friendly, a feature that demand for it prevails among young buyers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume chain will check franchises at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened at Croyden, South London, last week and the second will open at Leslie Oak, Birmingham, at a later date this year.
Online shopping and beyond purchasing smaller food quantities daily in local convenience stores requires supermarkets to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Koopa, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the branches would become more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight against the cheap networks Aldi and Lidl with more services and products that are not food.
Sainsbury's added sales points of Argus in hundreds of stores as well as a number of habitat points since purchasing both networks two years ago, additions which she said raised grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
Previous attempts by the network to revive the beauty products departments and its pharmacies ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but the engagement ended after a dispute over how to divide the profits from pharmacys within the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold the business operations of the pharmacy at 281 branches to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmacy network for 125 million sterling three years ago.
She says Lloyds will play a role in the program, by expanding the brand supply of luxury products for skin cultivation, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
The commercial manager of Sainsbury's, Paul Mills-Hix said: “We have made a makeover in appearance and a sense of our beauty product transitions, to improve the environment for customers.
In addition, we have invested in highly trained workers and will be available for consulting.
Our brand supply is designed to conform to any need and our attractive and comfortable environments make us an attractive destination for the purchase of beauty products, in a way that challenges the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby canceled a deal worth $11 million.
TV show star Dragons Den, Peter Jones, expressed "rage" after TV presenter Holly Willaby canceled a $11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and with ITV
Actually, Wilabi doesn't have time for their homemade brand and accessories.
The joint business of the two is considered similar to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old show presenter This Morning announced her departure at the post on Eastgram.
Holly Willaby left the show's star Dragons Den Peter G. Jones furious by canceling her last-minute participation in the prestigious lifestyle brand of the two—to focus on her fat contracts with Marks & Spencer and with ITV.
Sources said that Gjones responded "in anger" when the TV star announced during a stormy meeting on Tuesday at his business empire's main offices in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, which followed her new transactions – worth up to 1.5 sterling – she did not have enough time to devote to their domestic brand and accessories.
The joint business of the two was considered similar to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to double Willabi's fortune, estimated at 11 million sterling.
While 37-year-old Willavi posted on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, G. Jones was on a flight from Britain to one of his resorts.
According to one of the sources: "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's top priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would provide her with income in the next few decades.
A decision to leave completely surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
The company's warehouses in Marlow are filled with products that are ready for sale."
Experts believe that the approachable departure of This Morning, which is one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, may cost the company millions as a result of huge investments in diverse products, ranging from pillows and candles to home clothes, and the potential for further delay in launch.
And that could bring about the end of a long friendship.
Willabi, who is a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Cup for ten years.
Willaby formed Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Johns joined as chairman of the company in March.
The couple spent vacations together and Jones owns 40 percent of Bledwyn's television production company.
Willaby will become the ambassador to the M&S brand and replace Annette McPartlin as a presenter on the I'm A Celebrity program of ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We do not comment on his business affairs.
..hard talk and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism to which he was credited by the news press for sayings that some define as "non-presidential" and that he was so positive about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said in a "news presenter" voice.
"I didn't make any concessions."
He noted that Kim is interested in a second session after praising their first June meeting as a major step in the direction of dismantling North Korea from nuclear weapons.
But the nuclear disarmament negotiations froze.
More than three months after the summit meeting in June in Singapore, the senior North Korean diplomat Ree Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly, that North Korea did not see a "responsible response" on the part of the United States to the initial disarmament measures made by North Korea.
Instead, he said that the U.S. continues sanctions intended to continue the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view of his talk at the rally.
"We're in great shape with North Korea," he said.
"We almost went to war against North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim resulted in positive results – the termination of missile trials, assistance in the release of prisoners and the return of the remains of American soldiers home.
And he defended his extraordinary approach in his talk of relations with Kim.
“ It is so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into that full stadium, we had about 200 people standing there," Trump said pointing directly at him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia caused the destruction of an island and the killing of hundreds of people
After the Lumbuk earthquake, for example, non-governmental foreign organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lumbuk lost their homes, there was no national disaster declared, which is a condition to expedite international aid.
“ In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so this is a little challenging," said Mrs. Sombang.
Although the Save the Children organization prepares a team to travel to Palo, it is not yet clear if foreign envoys can pass through the territory.
Mr. Sotopo, the spokesman for the National Disasters Agency, said Indonesian authorities are engaged in assessing the situation in Palo to see if more international services contribute to the relief effort.
In light of the constant earthquakes taking place in Indonesia, the country remains unfortunately unprepared for natural disasters.
While tsunamis were built in Acha County, they are rare in other coastal areas.
The obvious lack of warning alarms on a tsunami in Palo, although warning exists, contributed to mental loss.
Even in the best of times, the travel between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship that was protecting Lumbuk to treat earthquake victims, making its way to Palo, but it would take at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
Improving Indonesia's shaky infrastructure stands at the center of President Gjoku's campaign and has made his confession, and he has invested many funds on roads and railways.
But Mr. G'ko stands in front of funding deficits for his run to be re-elected next year.
Mr. Gjku also faces pressure of ongoing class tensions in Indonesia as a result of the religious allocation process of the Muslim majority in the country.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes in battles between Christian and Muslim gangs in the streets – using knives, bows and arrows and other domestic weapons.

Cromwell Parliament Statue became the next target for attacks on memorials in the struggle around › that has written history :
Disposing of the statue would be poetic justice in light of the Taliban expulsion" — Puritan supporters of so many cultural and religious artifacts in England
But in Cromwell Society, Mr. Creek's suggestion is "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said "Inevitable was that in the current dispute over the removal of statues, the character of Oliver Cromwell standing outside Westminster Palace would become the target.
The fragmentation of the sculptures of the civil wars in England was not done on Cromwell's order and was not carried out by him.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell falls victim due to the actions of one of his predecessors in the dynasty – Thomas Cromwell – in the century before.
Cromwell's impressive representation in the hands of sculptor Sir William Hamu Thorncroft, is evidence of the view in the 19th century and part of the historiography of a character many think is still worthy of paying tribute to.
Mr Goldsmith ‘ said to the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell was perceived by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than he is today, as defending Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the royal.
The question of whether this is a completely accurate assessment is the subject of a continuing historical controversy.
The irrefutable fact is that the struggle in the mid-17th century shaped the development of our nation later, and Cromwell is one identified figure representing one side of the barricade at the time.
His achievements as the Lord Protector ‘are also worthy of honor and commemoration.'
A deadly pig who would drive a Chinese farmer to death.
Local media sources report that a pig attacked a farmer's death in a market in southwestern China.
The man, identified by his last name "Ewan", was found dead with a torn artery covered with blood near the pigsty in the market in Lufenshaw County, reportedly the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A farmer prepares to inject vaccines into a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Shining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled on Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan County to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day his cousin found him dead, and found that a door to a pigsty nearby was open.
He said there was a large male pig with blood on his mouth.
A criminal investigation confirmed that the pig weighing 250 kg attacked the farmer, according to the report.
"My uncle's feet were full of blood and torn off," said a cousin whose last name was Wu, as quoted in Guiyang Evening News.
In security camera footage Yuan was seen entering the market on Thursday morning at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Owen or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked behind bars to prevent him from attacking more people, while police were collecting evidence at the scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although the phenomenon is rare, pigs have previously been reported to have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused mortal injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig pinned a farmer in Wales to his tractor until the farmer's wife drove the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but the taste of blood may be "Trigger".
“ They just play.
They're like naughty children, very inquisitive... They don't mean you any harm.
All you have to do is give them the proper measure of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall in vast areas in the southwestern United States
Depending on the forecast, Hurricane Rosa weakens while moving over cooler waters on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
However, Storm Rosa will bring flooding rains all over northern Mexico and southwest U.S. over the next few days.
The winds in the Rosa storm reached a speed of 135 km/h, meaning a Category 1 hurricane and as of Sunday at 5 am on the Eastern Coast time, the storm's epicenter is 620 km southeast of Punta Yugeina, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a channel over the Pacific Ocean that is moving eastward towards the eastern coast of the U.S. as Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in tropical storm form, it will begin to push deep tropical moisture northwards into the southwest U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain to parts from Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical moisture that will combine with the approaching channel will create heavy rainfall in vast areas in the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 100 mm of rain would cause flash floods and risk landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will cause rain amounts to reach 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfalls in quantities of 50 to 100 mm are expected in parts of the Southwest United States, especially in Arizona.
There may be flash floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is highly recommended to avoid walking long distances in the desert when tropical rain is threatened.
Heavy rain may turn malls into raging rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong blowing winds and dust storms.
The approaching channel will bring local rainfall to parts of the Southern California coastline.
There may be total rainfall amounts of over 13 mm, which may cause waste erosion and smooth roads.
It will be the first rain in the region in this rainy season.
Scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning, and the rain will grow stronger and will spread later Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the four corners" on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In October there may be sharp temperature changes all over the U.S., while the Arctic region cools but the tropics remain rather warm.
This situation sometimes leads to dramatic changes in temperature between short distances.
On Sunday there is an excellent example of extreme temperature changes throughout the U.S. Center.
There are temperature differences of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis Lade Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days, prolonged summer heat will try to evolve and expand again.
In early October the temperatures would be warm in most central and eastern U.S. areas, moving between 27–31 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
In New York City the temperature may reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is approximately 5 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast shows high odds for temperatures higher than average in Eastern USA in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Cavanaugh's hearing
Over 20 million people watched Thursday, in six television networks, in the fascinating testimony of the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Cavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political debate continued, with news bulletins in the middle of regular broadcasts to announce a surprise development on Friday: an agreement written by the Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation into the examination of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Cavanaugh felt her body while drunk and tried to undress her during a high school student party.
Cavanaugh, in the heated testimony, said he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers was even higher than the report on 20.4 million viewers according to Nielsen Index.
Nielsen Corporation tested the average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available for other networks broadcasting the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen usually finds it difficult to measure people who watch offices.
In comparison, it is an audience watching a scale similar to that of the football playoff game or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen's data, Fox News Channel, whose commentators enthusiastically support Cavanaugh's appointment, led among all the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing.
ABC placed second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.5 million, according to Nielsen's report.
The level of interest remained high after the hearing.
Senator Flake was the main character in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the moderate Republican senator's office issued an announcement that he would vote in favor of Cavanaugh's appointment, he was filmed by CNN and CBS photographers when a group of protestors yell at him while attempting to get into the elevator to reach a hearing at the Judiciary Committee.
He stands in a humiliated gaze for several minutes while the exhibitors rebuked him, with all of this being filmed live on CNN.
"I'm standing here before you," said one of the women.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office posted a message saying, before the elevator door closed, that he would say further things at the committee hearing.
Broadcasting and cable networks all aired live hours later, with the Legal Committee about to point out Cavanaugh's application for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would vote in favor of the nomination only on the condition that an understanding was accepted that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate over the next week, which required Democratic minority members.
Flake was partially persuaded following conversations that existed with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After a conversation with Koons and with a number of senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had power, because it was clear that Republicans would not have the majority to confirm Cavanaugh's appointment without an investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Cavanaugh.

Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters supporting independence collided with forces of riot police, and while thousands joined anti-annual protests to mark the first anniversary of the party's vote on Catalonia independence.
A group of masked separatists who were blocked by the riot cops, egged and sprinkled paint powder, creating black dust clouds on the streets that are usually stunned by tourists.

For several hours, independence advocate groups who sang “not forgotten, not forgiven ” were faced by supporters of the unity that called“ the long live of Spain. ”
In the local press, fourteen people were reported to have been treated for minor injuries sustained by the protesters.
Tensions remained high in independence support areas a year after the referendum held on 1 October was tried illegally by the Spanish government, but celebrated by the Catalans supporters of independence.
Voters chose a large majority of votes to become an independent country, although the vote percentage was low when those opposed to the separation in most of them boycotted the vote.
Government authorities in Catalonia reported that nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to prevent voting in polls throughout the area in violent clashes.
Independence support groups set up camps for the stay of the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the National Police.
The demonstration was held but had to be conducted on a different course.
Narcisse Thrams, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he had lost hope of Catalonia's chance of independence.
“ Last year we had our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy for being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan separatist parties have won an important, albeit pressing victory, in last December elections, they have had difficulty maintaining momentum this year when many of their best known leaders stay in voluntary exile or prisons awaiting trial for their part in organizing the referendum and following which the Declaration of Independence.
Juan Poig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police support demonstration on his phone, said that the debate was inflamed by politicians on both sides of the barricade.
“ It gets worse, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Yonkers, one of the nine Catalan leaders who are sitting in prison awaiting trial since the late of last year, announced that he will run for the European Parliament election next year.
“ Standing up as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce its regression with the democratic values and oppression we have witnessed from the government of Spain," he said.
Lundundry: A number of men were arrested after a car butted in the house.
Three men – aged 33. 34 and 39 – were arrested after a car was rearranged several times at the House of Blondie.
The event took place at Blinaggarg Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. on the UK clock.
Detective Investigator Bob Belmings said that the gates were damaged as well as the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point an arrow was fired from a bow to the car.
A manga kick gives Livingston a 1–0 win over Rang ‘Russ'
Dolly Manga's first goal for Livingston promised the victory.
Livingston, who had just made the league, stunned Rangjers and coach Stephen Gérard which is only his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Aberocks Club.
Dolly Manga's kick meant a lot because Gary Holt's team moved up a notch with Hibernian in second place.
G'Rarr's team is left without a home win in the Premier League this season, and will face lead Harts, behind which it is eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangjers would host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends the lack of home losses streak to six games, and head coach Holt has not experienced a break since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities in front of a weak guest group.
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before they scored a goal, when their directness caused Rangjers to various problems.
Scott Robinson broke forward but dragged his attempts ahead of a goal, and then Alan Lethgoi could focus his efforts only laterally after slipping in to meet Craig Helgt's header before the goal.
The hosts were willing to allow the Ranger to play before them, knowing that they could make it difficult for the group to host free kicks.
And that was how the decisive gate took place.
The Herngjrs took a free kick and Livingston created an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to block Manga, who made a touch and scored a goal from the center of the expansion.
At this point, the Rangers controlled possession of the ball but found that the home protection was impenetrable, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained virtually unthreessed.
This pattern was drawn to the second half, although Alfredo Morelos did force Kelly to save the gate.
Scott Pitnam was tackled by Rangers goalkeeper spies Alan McGregor and Leith "Goy touched a cross ball from another Levigston free kick".
Crossballs continued to enter Livingstone's wide and brake, while two penalty balls—after a penalty offense of Hellcat on replacement Glenn Middleton, and one on hand touching—were removed.
? Amazing ? From Livingston - Surgery
Alastair Lamont, BBC Scottland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Amazing game and amazing outcome from Livingston.
All players were excellent, and continued to exceed expectations in this upward swing.
Their acting style and player personnel have hardly changed since returning to the leading position, but it should be given much credit to Holt for the way he has consolidated the team since his arrival.
He had so many stars.
Captain Holkett was awesome, leading a remarkably organized defense, while Manga retained Connor Goldson and G. Jo Waral in high detail all along.
However, the Rangers were uninspired.
Although they were quite good sometimes under G'Rar, they did not meet these standards.
They lacked the final ball – just once they opened the home team's defense – and this is a red light bulb for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the field.
A mixed reception for Erdouan in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met on Saturday (29 September) for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdoğan's controversial visit to Germany — whose aim was to amend the relationship between the two NATO Alliance member states.
They were disagreements regarding issues such as human rights, press freedom, and Turkey's acceptance of the European Union.
From there Erdoğan continued to Cologne to participate in the opening of a new giant mosque.
Cologne is the largest city of Turks outside Turkey.
Police announced security reasons for blocking a public of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters rallied nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of opponents Erdoğan – many of them Kurds – also voiced, protesting both Erdoğan's policy lines and Germany's decision to welcome him in the country.
The opposing protesters reflect the controversy surrounding the guest that some of the Turks in Germany praise him as a hero and others condemn him as a tyrant.

Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in the riot
Six guards were injured in a riot in a secure prison for men, so the prison office delivered.
The riot broke out at the Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 09:30 p.m. on the UK clock, and it continues still.
Special police from a tornado unit were brought to the scene to eliminate the riot, which includes eight prisoners and halted into one wing.
Guards were treated at the scene due to minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “Extraordinarily skilled prison guards were recruited to deal with an ongoing event at Long Lartin Prison.
Six guards were treated for injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those involved will be handed over to the police and their prison periods may be extended."
Long Lartin Prison houses 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June the prison governor was reported to have received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, riot cops were called into prison to deal with a serious riot where guards were attacked with pool sticks.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flash floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (shaped areas may benefit)
It is rare for a tropical outlet to strike Arizona, but that is exactly what is expected to happen at the beginning of next week, when the remains of Hurricane Rosa will cross the desert in the southeast and bring danger to flash floods with them.
The National Weather Service has already declared danger to flash floods on Monday and Tuesdays for West Arizona into Southeast Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Storm Rosa is expected to pass a direct course over Phoenix on Tuesday, and approach in late Monday with rainfall.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only “ten tropical cyclones have remained in the status of a tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina Storm (1967) was a hurricane in a range of 64 km from the Arizona border."
The final models of the Arizona Hurricane Storm Center view 50 to 100 mm rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm on the margins of Arizona Mogulon.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, are expected to receive 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated locations receiving a total of 50 mm.
For those outside the flood zone to risk flash flooding, the rain of the Rosa Storm may be a blessing because the area suffered a drought.
Although floods are a serious danger, some of these rains will be helpful as the Southwest area is currently suffering from drought conditions.
According to U.S. drought tracking, over 40% of Arizona is in a severe drought, which is the second category in severity," reported siteweather.com.
First, the route of the Rosa Storm will reach landfall across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa Storm, still at hurricane power on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, is 620 km (620 km) south of Punta Yojina, Mexico, moving north at approximately 20 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific, and therefore weakens.
It is therefore expected to land in Mexico at the intensity of a tropical storm in the afternoon or the evening of Monday.
The rains across parts of Mexico can be heavy and cause a strong flood hazard.
“ Rainfallfalls including 75 to 150 mm are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a chance of up to 250 mm, reports siteweather.com.
The Rosa Storm will then continue into Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical outlet, which will then continue across Arizona into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from Rosa storm, or from its remains, is heavy rains in Baja California, Southwest Sonora and the Southwest desert in the US", delivered the National Center for Hurricanes.
These rains are expected to cause flash floods and improper flows from dangers of living in the desert, and landslides in the mountainous areas.

Trump said Kavanaugh suffered the conviction and anger of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a vote to reject Democratic Party's shocking rudeness and tactics," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kwano “suffered the wickedness, anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the entire process of appointing him.
Cavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, while strongly denying and emotionally the accusation of Christine Blazi Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her accusation.
The President said on Saturday that "US residents saw Cavanaugh's brilliantness and quality and courage" that day.
"Vote to approve Judge Cavanaugh's appointment is a vote to approve the appointment of one of the most excellent legal minds of our time, a court man with excellent public service history," he told his supporters audience in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Cavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the importance of Republicans coming to vote in the mid-prime election.
“ Five weeks to one of the most important votes of our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but actually I am a candidate," he said.
“ So I run around everywhere to fight for great candidates. ”
Trump claimed the Democrats were on a mission to “oppose and interfere.
A senior Republican party aide informed CNN that the first central procedural vote in the Senate Malay on Cavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds are killed in earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, and the number is rising.
At least 384 people were killed, many of them swept in huge waves crashed on the beaches, when a strong earthquake and tsunami struck Indonesian island Sulawesi, so official sources reported on Saturday.
Very many people were gathered for a beach festival in Palo City on Friday, when waves carried on 6 m (18 ft) high crashed on the beach at sunset, and swept many to their deaths and destroyed everything in their way.
The tsunami occurred following a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“ When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still dealing with their affairs on the beach rather than immediately fleeing, and they were being victimized, ” said Sotopo Purvo Nuruho, a spokesman for the BNPB Disaster Management Agency, in a briefing at Gjakata.
“ The tsunami did not arrive alone, he towed cars, logs, houses, he hit everything on the ground," said Nurho, adding that the tsunami advanced across the open sea at 800 km (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and they survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
Air footage published by the Disaster Agency showed destruction to numerous houses and shops, bent bridges and courses and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subshocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area where 2.4 million inhabitants.
The agency for the assessment and implementation of technology (BPPT) in Indonesia stated in a message that the energy released in the Friday's powerful tremor was 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to him, the geography of the city, which sits at the edge of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nurho described the destruction as "major" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
Bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nurho said the death toll and damage may be larger along North Palo with a 300 km long coastline (190 mi), an area called Dongla, and which is closer to the epicenter area of the earthquake.
The media “has completely collapsed and there is no information" from Donegala, Nurho said.
The area houses over 300,000 people" said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its people and volunteers are on their way to affected areas.
“ This is a tragedy now, but things could get much worse, ” he said.
On Saturday, much criticism was directed towards the agency for not announcing that a tsunami had hit Palo, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning had been issued.
In an amateur video distributed on social media, a man can be seen on a tall roof of a building shouting hysterical warnings about the tsunami approaching people on the street below.
Within minutes a wall of water crashes on the beach, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify that the photo was authentic.
The tremor and tsunami caused widespread power outages that cut off communications around Palo and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending transport aircraft with assistance from Gjakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but the survivors still desperately need food and other essential supplies.
The city's airport was only opened for relief efforts and would remain closed until October.
President Jóku and his friend were scheduled to visit rescue centers in Palo on Sunday.
The death toll in Tsunami in Indonesia climbed to over 800.
It's very difficult.
While the people of the World Vision organization from Donegala arrived safely in the city of Palo, where workers sheltered in shelters made of tarps erected in their office yards, they passed mirrors of destruction on their way, Mr. Dosbah said.
“ They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed, ” he said.
It's very difficult.
Even as relief groups began the unfortunate operations of the disaster relief gear drive, some complained that they had avoided reaching the Palo of experienced foreign aid workers.
According to Indonesia's regulations, funding, supplies, and people from other countries can only be started if the affected area is declared a national disaster zone.
This thing hasn't been done yet.
“ It is still defined as a county-level disaster," said Olia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“ After the government says, "Okay, it's a national disaster," we can open the door to international aid, but that position has not yet been announced. "
Upon the second nightfall on Palo after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, members and family of the missing people clung to the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that light up the bleak stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue men rescued a woman buried under rubble for two days, with her mother's body beside her.
Gandon Subandu, the coach of the Indonesia floating parachute team, coached two missing paragliding paratroopers towards the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped in the hotel see Raheem, including Mr. Mandagi, were his disciples.
“ I am carrying my own emotional burden, ” he said.
Mr. Gandon recalled how in the hours after the news of the hotel collapse sees a common among the floating paratrooper community, he desperately sent the WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palo, who took part in the beach festival.
However, his messages showed only one gray sign of criticism, instead of a pair of blue markings.
“ I think it means that the messages were not delivered, ” he said.

Kenya West: Rapper changed its name to Ye
rapper Kenya Vest changes its name to Ye.
In announcing the change in Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The entity that was known as Kenya West."
41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used the nickname as his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes first for his performance on the television show Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande who canceled her participation because of “emotional reasons, ” said the show’s creator.
In addition to being shortened to his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible the word means 'you'", West said earlier this year, when discussing his album name with radio broadcaster Big Boy.
“ So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It passed from Kanye, which is the one and only meaning, to just Çye ‘just a reflection of the good in us, the evil in us, or the confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He's one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs became known as Puff Daddy, P Daddy or Diddy, but this year declared that he preferred the names . . . . . . love and . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
A former partner of West, J. Z., also passed between versions of his name with no dash and uppercase letters.
The President of Mexico has pledged not to use the military against civilians.
Mexico's elected president, Anders Manuel Lopes Overdoor, pledged never to use military force against civilians, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody oppression against students.
Lopes Overdoor promised on Saturday in the Square of Nalko “never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people.
Army forces fired on a nonviolent demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when leftist student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
Lopes Overdoor pledged to support young Mexicans by providing financial support to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education opportunities urge young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funding of artificial intelligence.
Upon increasing China's activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it invests in research in the field, so says the researcher engaged in the field of artificial intelligence Kai-Po Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His words come after various parts of the U.S. government have issued statements regarding artificial intelligence, even while the U.S. government has no official artificial intelligence strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its program last year: it aims to be No. 1 in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“ Multiplying the research budget in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," he told me.
The funding multiplier can double the odds that the next great AI achievement will be achieved in the US, telling me to network CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, China, China, China, China, and the New World Order", was published this month in the New York City Department of Marine Species, is the CEO of China's most prominent intelligence agency: F+.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated a first ranked Barbarsian player in the U.S., and later served as Senior Director at Microsoft Research and President of Google Branch in China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the agency's robotics challenge for advanced research projects, and asked when you would be next, to help identify the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, told me.
“ It is not China that takes our top researchers at the academy, it is the business companies that do so, ” he told me.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited stars in recent years from the universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said that also changes in immigration policies could help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think Green Card should automatically be offered to PhD owners in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the China State Council published its AI program for the next generation.
The National Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences gives funding to people in academic institutions similar to the way in which the National Foundation for Science and Other Government Organizations Department of Appropriations for U.S. Researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence, designed to involve partners from the industry and the academy, and the White House announced the establishment of a special commission for artificial intelligence.
And the month announced a $2 billion investment in the initiative in the field of artificial intelligence under the name AI Next.
As for the NSF, she currently invests more than $100 million a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, a US legislative initiative designed to create a national security committee for artificial intelligence, has been inactive for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the name of the country
On Sunday, Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a step that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that prevented it from joining the European Union and NATO
Greece, in which a district called Macedonia exists, claims that its neighbor's name of conscience is a claim to Greece's territory and vetoed its joining NATO and the European Union.
Both countries signed in June a deal based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would damage the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population in Macedonia.
President George ‘Ivanov said he would not vote on the referendum and a boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the amount of voters would withstand the minimum amount of 50% needed to make the referendum valid.
The question in the ballot note is thus formulated: "Are you/are you in favor of joining NATO and the European Union with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaib, claim that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, which is one of the states created from the dissolution of Yugoslavia, can join the bodies such as the European Union and NATO.
"I have come today to point out the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live in freedom under the European Union umbrella, because it means a protected life for all of us," said Olivera G. George of 79-year-old Yazbeka in Skopia.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will comply with the results of the vote to make it a fixer.
To change the name would take a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said there were no irregularities as of 1300 hours.
However, the percentage of voters stood only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary final election, in which 66 percent of voting rights owners came to vote.
"I've come to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old G'osa Tanevsky, a voter in the capital of Skopia.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaib, his wife Zorarica and his son Duško rule out their ballot in Stromitz, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, in the Macedonia referendum on the change of state name, which will open the door to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the House of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardraków prepared a small stage and chairs in front of tents that established those who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with the upright head, not through the servants' entrance," Kawardrkov said.
“ We are a poor country, but we have honor.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can appeal to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian union."
Prime Minister Zaib said NATO companies would bring most necessary investments to Macedonia, in which unemployment rates exceed 20%.
“ I believe the vast majority will be in favor of over 80 percent of our citizens supporting the EU and NATO," Zayev said after voting.
He said that a positive outcome would be “security of our future. ”
A poll published on Monday the Macedonian Policy Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum – less than the required participation percentage.
Another referendum, conducted by the Macedonian television network Telema TV, found that 57 of the captors are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to succeed, the voter percentage must be at least 50 percent plus one.
Failure of the referendum will be the first significant loss of pro-West government policy since it seized power in May last year.
Video: Manchester City player Sergio Aguaro navigates through all Brighton defense to score goal
Sergio Aguaro and the Sterling Rahim broke through Brighton's defense in a 2–0 win by Manchester City Saturday at Ithyahad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguaro seemed to easily occupy the gate.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defensive players, before breaking into the open field.
At this point Aguaro found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one shield before running for a few additional defenders on the Brighton Extension border.
Then he kicked a pass to the left, and found Sterling.

"Agoro suffers from foot problems," said the manager of Manchester City to reporters.
“ We agreed that he would play for about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the sky's contents the starting advantage of major league rivalry.
This gate came in the 29th minute.
Aguaro received the ball deep in Brighton's territory during this.

Scherzer wants to play spoiler in front of the Rockies.
With the Nationals exiting the playoffs, there was no good reason to force another start.
But Scherzer characterized by much competition, hopes to win on Sunday against Colorado Rockys, but only if there are still consequences for the playoffs for the Rockies, who lead one game over the Los Angeles Dodges in the NL West League.
The Rockies have at least booked an open card place with a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but have not yet secured their first place in the house.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can be able to play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the viewers and the other team will probably play at the highest level at any point that I face you this year.
Why wouldn't I want to deal with it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the starter for Sunday, but reportedly they tend to let Scherzer serve in such a situation.
Scherzer, which would be his #34 start, held a Bulgarian practice on Thursday and will serve on his day of rest – Sunday.
Washington's right-hand pitcher is an 18–7 record holder with ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 rounds 2/3 this season.
Trump. There's a rally in West Virginia.
The president indirectly hinted at the situation surrounding his elected candidate to Supreme Court Brett Cavanaugh, while he spoke about the importance of Republicans coming to vote in the Mid-Prime elections.
“ Everything we did is at stake in November.
Five more weeks for the most important election of our lives.
It's one of the most, most -- I'm not running, but actually I am running, and that's why I'm running everywhere and fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, “You see this horrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And if determined to take back the power by any means necessary, you see the convictions, the despicable ones.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that's what they want is power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats, he says, are on a mission to “oppose and interfere. ”
“ And you see it during the last four days, ” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and wicked and despicable and dishonest."
He mentioned in her name the minority leader on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which provoked booing levels from the audience.
“ Remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, whatever.
No, uh no, I waited until -- that was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a pluralist place.
She's not tolerant of those who express their opinion.
When momentum movement activists at my local party branch voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
After all, I am the last in the line of Labour MPs to be told they are not welcome—and only because we have expressed our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she strongly stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the decision to censor me criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, to Europe—to most irony, issues similar to those to which G. R. R. did not agree with previous party leaders.
In the East Nottingham Liber Party meeting committee on Friday it was said that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour Party MP, the general commission meetings on Friday nights were just like that.
Today’s step is not the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of politics “more kind, gentler ” long forgotten, if ever began.
It becomes increasingly apparent that the Labour Party has no tolerance for different views, and any opinion is judged by its being acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This situation began shortly after Gjrémy was elected head of the party, when colleagues I previously thought we shared a similar political view, began to expect him to make a U-turn and take positions that otherwise I would never have agreed to – whether it was national security or one European market.
Every time I speak in public -- and it doesn't really matter what I say -- immediately comes an abusive flood of reproof on social media with calls for impeachment, condemning the politics of the center and readings that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than my colleague, because the comments aimed at me tend to be political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of racial abuse every day but never withdraw.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse became a common interest.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are already in the same pluralistic place, and with any "untrust" decision or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes more trouble.
Over the past two years, many have advised me to keep my mouth shut, not be so loud, and then I will be “fine. ”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, horrified by the neglect of the Thatcher government that caused my public school class to almost fall apart, I was looking for how to fight for better social services for those in need of them most - whether as a local council member or a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my political views, including the last election.
No man in East Nottingham could be confused as to my political positions and issues of controversy with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the decision on Friday, all I have to say is that while the country is crawling towards Brexit that would hurt families, business and our public service, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of Labour.
But to be honest, the one message I have is not for the momentum movement in Nottingham, but for my constituency, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of impeachment threats or political utilities will deter me in a way that I believe serves most of all of your interests.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: The Unbeaten Air to the Summit
Two recent fresh ones slightly tipped the final score, but surely Air deserves a win in the wonderfully entertaining game held today in the Scottish Premier League.
They are now at the top of the table, the only unbeaten side of the ten.
In the end, it was their better defense, as well as taking much more risks, played for the good of the home team, and coach Peter Murtzchi had all the reasons to be satisfied.
“ We have stood the test in our games so far, and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of the Melrose group said: "Air deserves all the credit, they've taken better risks than we have."
Trey's Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, converted by Fraser Callimo, placed Eir in the lead position, but a yellow ticket to Scotland team player Rory Hughes released to the game by the Warriors, allowing Melrose to score and Jason Baggot caught Troy who was not Homered.
Kalimo raised Air's lead with a foul, before at exactly halftime, he captured and then converted Trey Solo to obtain 17–5 for the air at halftime.
But Melrose opened the second half well and Patrick Engerson's Trey, converted by Batgot, reduced the gap to five points.
There was then a long delay due to a severe injury by Rudrich Knut, taken away in Alonka, and starting with the game's regeneration, Air increased the gap through Stafford McDowell's Trey, which was converted by Clemo.
Acting captain of Air Blair McPherson then absorbed a yellow card, and again Melrose took advantage of the other person with Trey who wasn't Homer of Bruce Colvin, at the conclusion of a series of tremendous pressure.
But the home team recovered, and when Struan Hatchünson received a yellow card for attacking Clemo without a ball, from the penalty line, McPherson scored a touchdown ‘Down behind Air's progressive mole.
Kaleimo converted, as he did again almost from the return to the match, after Kyle Roy Ess kicked David Armstrong's punch and sent the Greg Henry wing to the sixth Trey of the home team.
Star Still Game seems ready for a new career in the restaurant field
Star Still Game, Ford Kiernan, seemed ready to move to the restaurant branch after it was discovered that he had been cited as manager of a restaurant company on license.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of J. K. Jarvis on BBC's popular show, which he writes and where he stars along with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season would be the final season of the show, and Kiernan seems to be planning life after Krylang.
According to the official records, he is the manager of Adriptmoren Limited.
The player refused to comment on the story, although Scottish Sun's source implied that Kiernan was looking for ways to get into the thriving restaurant business in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia that can't be found to the sea hopes that the court will open a path for her to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the Naval Headquarters covered in La Paz ships.
Public buildings raise a blue-sea flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon carry the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
It is our duty to reclaim it."
All over Bolivia that cannot be found to the sea, the memory of a shoreline lost in favor of Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century, still alive – as well as the yearning to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be at their peak for decades, while Bolivia awaits the international court's decision on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
“ Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and tranquility, and is, of course, expected out of a positive attitude to come," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will treasure the international court decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia's demand that after decades of fragmented talks, Chile will be obliged to negotiate a sovereign approach to the sea to Bolivia.
The charismatic native president of Bolivia, Ave Morales—who faced a controversial struggle to re-election next year—hangs a lot of decision on Monday.
“ We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean, ” he promised in late August.
But commentators don't think there's much chance that the court will decide for Bolivia, and that even if it decides for its own good, it won't matter much.
The United Nations court sitting in the Hague has no authority to grant Chile territory, stating that it will not determine the results of possible calls.
The fact that the decision of the International Court came only six weeks after hearing the closing arguments indicates that the case “was not complex, ” but Paz Zarata, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's claims, the last four years may even have weakened them.
"The issue of access to the sea is hijacked by the current government in Bolivia," Zarata said.
Morales' war rhetoric eliminated any remnant of goodwill from Chile, according to her.
At some point Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to have discussions after that.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors between them since 1962.
The previous president, Eduardo Rodriguez Veltza, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a "great opportunity to open a new era in a relationship with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreements in favor of both sides," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – makes use of the naval issue as a political lever.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, ” he added.
"Stopping is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says that nuclear damage is not going to happen unless she can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ree Jung said Erzzo would never unload her nuclear weapon first if she could not trust Washington.
Ree spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the U.S. to keep the promises she made during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His words come as the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompau, is on the verge of reopening the diplomatic contacts on nuclear weapons that have reached a dead end more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim J. Hong On.
Rie said it was a "dream in Aspemia" to think that continuing the U.S. sanctions and resistance to declare the end of the Korean War would force North Korea to kneel.
The U.S. is afraid to agree to an announcement without North Korea taking significant steps first for nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, are interested in a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that North Korea is serious about giving up its nuclear arsenal, in which it is likely that it sees the only way to protect its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
A fashion show in Paris reveals the new trend in giant hats found on its way to the luxury stores everywhere.
The solution is to anyone who wants to expand the collection of hats or receive complete protection from the sun.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a series of huge and crazy headdresses for their SS19 collection, in a fashion show that stunned the fashion week scene in Paris.
Unpractical caps in the plot occupied Instagram this summer, and these designers brought their extraordinary works to the fashion show track.
Valentino’s notable item was a falcon-colored overcoated hat ‘ decorated with broad feather-like margins that covered the models' heads.
Other shattered-sized fixtures included decorated watermelons, a magician's hat and even pineapples—but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Tom Brown also revealed a selection of odd masks – checked in time for Halloween.
Many of the coloured masks included sewing lips and more blood to Hannibal Lecter than to Hot Couture.
One piece mentioned a diving mask including snorkel and glasses, and another one looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And those who want to continue with a huge fashion statement -- their time has come.
Fashion commentators predict that the giant top hats make their way to the high-end stores everywhere.
The giant hats are the next hit after Çla Bomba", the straw cap with a half-metre margin observed on everyone's head, ranging from Mariana to Emily Rataykowski.
The Cult Label behind the highly impractical hat that flooded the social networks gave birth to another large piece on the track – a nearly as big a key sea bag as that of a swimsuit model who carried it.
The written-painted relaxation bag, with the margins of rephyllation strands and a white leather handle, was the notable item in the G.S.19 collection of "Klin Le Ribeira at Fashion Week in Paris".
A celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I predict that large caps and large sea bags will reach the luxury stores next summer—because the design has made a huge impression and will be difficult to ignore the demand for exosoriz in excess size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the citizens of the world
The independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another cluster of outstanding test results, which receives strengthening from individual and group success in sports, art, music, and other fields in the community.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to give the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, for a career where they will choose and place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of planning and assimilating a custom curriculum, we discover that modern languages continue to accumulate popularity as a school-wanted field.
Nelson Mandela said: “Talking to a man in a language he understands, it gets into his head.
Speaking to a man in his own language, it gets into his heart."
It's an important reminder that we can't rely only on English when we want to build connections and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of recent tests this year, languages can be seen to be at the top of tables with the highest success rate in independent schools.
A total rate of 68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages has achieved a high A grade.
The data collected from 74 schools members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students achieved a high A grade in Mandarin, and so did 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish.
These data show that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and teenagers will no doubt need in the future.
Today the field of languages as a matter of choice is considered to be the same level as STEM issues (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the independent schools' curriculum and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the British Board of Employment and Skills found that of the reasons employers noted Cody to fill vacant positions, 17 percent were attributed to the lack of language skills.
Thus, to an increasing degree, language skills become an essential need to prepare students for future careers.
In the face of increases in language requirements for future job opportunities, these skills are essential in the world of globalization.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he learns a second language, he will have a significant advantage in the future because of this lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries is automatically stable a person in a position of advantage over competitors.
According to a YouTube survey that included more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak foreign language on a sufficient level for conversation, and French was the only language in which there was a bi-digit number of spokesmen's percentages, 15 percent.
That is why it is important to invest in teaching children languages today.
Knowledge in many languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different as to the languages taught in it.
Some schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will learn languages that are considered the most important for Britain in looking forward to the 21st century 20s, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever the child's interest, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in the independent schools, with a faculty specializing in the field.
The independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills it takes to succeed, in any predictable future.
There is no denying today, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, so this fact should be expressed in education.
Yes, modern languages need to be viewed as “international communication skills. ”
Independent schools will continue to offer these levels of choice, diversity and excellence to the children of Scotland.
It's the order of the hour.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools
LeBron is expected to play for the first time in the Lakers uniform on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait ended for fans waiting to see LeBron James play for the first time in the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the opening preseason match against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
But we haven't determined how many minutes he'll play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48", written on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted on Twitter that James would likely play a limited number of minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six Lakers preseason games.
“ At this point in my career I don’t need pre-season games to prepare, ” he said.
Trump rally time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is being developed in a flood of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, the Virginia system.
This is the first of five scheduled Trump rallies this week, including stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While voting his confirmation for a Supreme Court judge, Trump aims to build support towards the upcoming mid-term election, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can it be viewed online?
Trump's Assembly in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 1900 Eastern Coast time, Saturday 29 September 2018.
Trump's rally in West Virginia can be watched online in direct streaming on YouTube.
Trump will likely refer to the hearings held this week for Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh, and have become tensions around allegations of sexual misconduct and resulting in the Senate voting delay in a week while the FBI investigates the charges.
But the main goal of this flood of rallies is to help Republicans facing challenging November elections to achieve some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that the purpose of these five rallies next week is to “incentivize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to defend and expand the majority they hold of the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
“ Control of Congress is so critical to its agenda, that the president is willing to visit as many countries as possible with the introduction to the crowded election season," told Reuter a spokesman for Trump's campaign who sought to remain anonymous.
Tonight's rally, scheduled to take place at Wesbanko Stadium in Wheeling, can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract press coverage from the Pittsburgh media, to the West Virginia Metro News evaluation.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month Trump visits West Virginia, the country in which he has won over 40 points per cent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican candidate St. West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, who is behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should come to try to improve his situation in the polls," said Simone Haider, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuter.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows a willingness to struggle to maintain hope for the individual games on Sunday
After three single-sided sessions, the Sunday afternoon 4th Games are perhaps exactly what the Ryder Cup needs.
Momentum's propulsion pendulum is a totally invented sports concept, but the players really believe in it, and never more than in competitions like this.
So where do they think momentum is now?
"They had a six-point lead and now he's four, so you can see it as a little momentum," said Gjörn Sepith at the end of the day.
Europe has the advantage of course, four points ahead with 12 more in the game.
But the Americans, as Sepith says, feel that they have a little wind in sails, and have a lot to cheer up about, rather than the last of them in spiny form) and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boasts three points out of four.
Sepith was deadly from the green Hetty Al and is a leader in a personal example.
The cries of joy grew stronger as his turn continued, as he sank critical Pat to win the four-all-square match and Thomas dropped two after two.
His Pat who won Game 15on won a similar cry, the kind that shows that he believes the American team still has hope.
"Really all you have to do is dig deep and worry only about your own game," Sepith said.
That's all any of these players have left to do.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than a threshold" and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the lead story undisputed by the Ryder Cup.
The odd, yet charming duo of Europe are four out of four and are all sympathetic.
Mollywood were the only duo not to hit over the device on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the Bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and backwards nine on Friday morning.
The same rotation, and the way their energy seems to flow into the enthusiastic audience and from it, establishes the fact that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and will not be a more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to sign the potential European victory with the sun going down on the golf course Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is early to talk about European fame.
Boba and Tasson Webb Simpson finished with Serge ‘Yo Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he robbed you with Alex Norén.
Boggy and two doubles in the front nine dropped the Spaniards and Swedes into a hole they never came close to coming out of.
However, on Sunday there is no one to help you get out of the pit.
It's fascinating to look closely at the four balls and fours because of the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and leads significantly towards the last day, but this fourth session has shown that the American team is full of battle spirit that some, mostly within the United States, have doubted it.
Europe leads 10-6 towards the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe is in a healthy lead towards the Ryder Cup's last day after finishing the Saturday's four-ball and four-ball games in a 10–6 score against the US.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Lorenzo Molinari led the change with two wins over struggling Tiger Woods, and raised the gap so far at Le Golf National for four points.
The European side players of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to protect the trophy they lost in Heiseletin two years ago, dominated the Americans who missed the four-ball games this morning, bringing the series to 3–1.
The American players showed greater opposition in the fours games, winning two games, but were unable to close the gap.
To keep hold of the Cup, the friends of Jim Forick need eight points from the only 12 games.
Fleetwood is the first European Tirken to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were nicknamed "Mollywood" after an outstanding weekend, are only the second team to win four points from their four opening games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reid at the four-ball games, they continued a miraculous harmony together to defeat the weakened Woods and American rookie Bryson DeChambaugh with an even more prominent result of 5 and 4.
Woods, who towed himself across two games on Saturday, demonstrated random bursts of excellence, but so far he has lost 19 of the 29 games of the four balls and fours, and seven games in a row.
J"Steen Rose, who rested during the morning's four-ball games, returned to join Henrik Stanson in the fours games to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copeca – ranked first and third in the world.
However, not everything went easily to the European players in the pleasant weather and the light wind that sat southwest of Paris.
The notable three-time winner Jordan Sepith and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a pushy win 2 and 1 over John Ram of Spain and Ian Polter at the four-ball games and later returned to defeat Platter and Rory McElroy 4 and 3 in the fours games, after losing the first two dimples.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup Group returned from a negative four-point gap to the individual games, though as the holders of the Cup, Forick's men only need a draw to keep hold of the Cup.
However, after being placed second for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says that "no way" it will not disarm unilaterally without trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister announced on Saturday at the UN that continuing sanctions deepens its distrust in the United States and that there is no chance that the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under these circumstances.
Ree Yong Ho announced at the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken “a meaningful goodwill course ” during the past year, such as the cessation of nuclear missile trials, the dismantling of the nuclear testing site, and a commitment not to develop any more nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we see no corresponding response from the U.S.", he said.
“ Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national defenses and conditions like this under any circumstances will we not disband ourselves unilaterally from nuclear weapons first."
While Sherry repeated North Korea's recognizable complaints about U.S. opposition to a "classified" approach to nuclear dissolution, that North Korea would be rewarded while taking gradual steps, his statement seemed important in that she did not reject on the verge of nuclear dissolution, as did North Korea in the past.
Ree referred to a joint announcement released by Kim Jüng On and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim pledged to act towards nuclear dissolution of the Korean peninsula while Trump promised to protect the safety of North Korea.
North Korea sought an official end to the Korean War that took place in 1950–1953, however the United States said North Korea must give up its nuclear weapons first.
The U.S. also opposed calls to reduce international sanctions on North Korea.
“ The United States insists on ‘ nuclear dissolution first' and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its purpose in the way of coercion, and even resists ‘ declaring the end of the war,' Rye said.
“ The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is a dream of people who are ignorant about us.
But the problem is that the overwhelming sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ree did not mention any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the President of the United States highlighted in his speech at the UN earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jia-In over the past five months, adding: “If the other side of the nuclear dismantling issue was South Korea rather than the United States, the nuclear dissolution of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a stalemate."
Nevertheless, Ree's speech tone was dramatically different from that of last year, then told the United Nations General Assembly that attacking U.S. soil in North Korea missiles is inevitable after Mr. President of Evil called Kim a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened the "absolute destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarmament, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and that the sanctions must remain vigilant until the nuclear dissolution of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a definite time frame for it, adding that "if it takes two, three years or five months—it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argued that the United Nations Security Council should reward North Korea for measures taken.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompau, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue decisively and unbridled until we achieve a complete and verifiable nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously supported the toss of sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding of its ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri at the margins of the United Nations General Assembly and said later that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare the next summit.
Pompeo had already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left A Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been achieved, but hours later North Korea condemned him for placing “the demands of a gangster.
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear facility, if the U.S. took "compatible measures".
He said that Kim told him that "the appropriate steps" he was interested in included security guarantees for which Trump had pledged Trump in Singapore, as well as changes in the normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year teaches the participants how to sleep more, trying to struggle with the expanding macho culture of learning by staying up all night with caffeine.
Academic research found that university students number one in the world often have no idea as to the basic principles of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Casseisler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham & Wimnes Hospital, designed the course, which he estimated to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to open the course after a lecture that gave about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
“ At the end of the talk, one girl came up to me and said: › Why am I only told this now, in my senior year?")
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleeping – what surprised me," he told the Telegraph newspaper.
The course, delivered for the first time this year, explains to students the principles of how good sleeping habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improves their overall condition.
Paul Breira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a senior health care executive at the university, said the university decided to open the course after discovering that students had suffered a severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a dorm room, where students press coffee mugs, curtains, sports clothes and books—to get explanations for the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of a walking routine to sleep.
In another part, participants are told how continuous sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Subsequently, a map of campus, if interactive symbols, encourage participants to think about their daily routine.
“ We know that this will not change the behavior of students overnight.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Professor ‘Czeler.
He said that pride culture on sleepless nightfalls" still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students cause the problem of sleep deprivation growing.
Concern for adequate sleep, and good sleep quality, should be the secret weapon of each student to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation transfers the brain to hunger state, so we are hungry all the time.
Raymond Sue, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical biology and physics, helped Professor Zeisler design the course, having participated in one of his first-year classes at Harvard.
He said the course enlightened him and prompted him to encourage a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all students for advanced degrees to complete a similar teaching program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Zisel recommended students to look at the possibility of setting a clock that would ring when it was time to go to bed, and not only at the hour when waking up, and being alert to the harmful effects of blue light that electronic screen emitters and LED lighting, could violate the circade rhythm and thus cause problems in hiermouth.
Livingston 1 - 0 Range: A Gateway of decisive manga to Gérard's players
Herngjrs suffered another offensive of loss in an away game when Dolly Manga caused Stephen G. Gerard's rebel players to defeat 1–0 in Livingston.
The Aberox players hoped to achieve their first away game win since the 1–4 victory in February at St. Johnston, however Gari Holt's team caused only Gérard's second loss in 18 games as manager and left the team behind eight points after the Scottish Premier League team.
Manga attacked seven minutes before halftime and the uninspired Rangers did not appear to equalize.
While the Ranges now plummet to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place and immediately after Hibernian by goal margin.
And he may be waiting for another Rangejers double after the Kwon Callum Spence needed treatment due to a head injury after an object was probably thrown at him from the stands.
Gerard made eight exchanges in a team that passed Air to the semifinals in the Tefred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, rose with those eleven Livingston players who took a point from Harts last week, and he could be satisfied with the way his players tackled the opponents in any situation.
The res may have controlled possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball he had in their hands.
They almost scored in the second minute when Manga sent a ball to Scott Patman who kicked for Alan McGregor's goal, but midfielder kicked the ball too far.
Then a deep free kick by Keegan J. Cobb found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Leth Goy could only kick out of Corra.
The Rangers did take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have ruled in his favor a felony after a quarter-hour match, when he and Stephen Lawless collided, but Judge Stephen Thémson swung against the Colombian actor's urgings.
The Herngjrs only managed to kick twice to the goal in the first half but the Aberox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily brake the headbutt of Lesana Colibali and Obi Ajaria's weak kick.
While Livingston's opening in the 34th minute was contrary to how the game was conducted, no one would deny that they deserved it at least for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed to deal with a deep free ball of Jacobs.
Scott Artfield did not comment while Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who maintained calmness in moving the manga to a simple finish.
Gerard did an act at halftime when he replaced Colliby with Rain Kent, and the exchange resulted in an immediate impact almost when the extreme/wing inserted a ball into Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston continued to force the guest team to play exactly the kind of game they liked, with Leith ‘Goy and Hellcat continuing to send long balls.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the other stages, but McGregor stood well to prevent J.C. Jacobs' experience before Lithguy rammed from the corner.
The replacement player for the Rangejers Glenn Middleton later had another claim to foul against J. Jacobs, but Thomson ignored again.
Almanach: Inventor of Geiger Mona
And now to stand from the widow of Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and continue... the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Gallagher was born in Germany.
Geyer developed a method that allows the identification and measurement of radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then the device has become a pillar in science, but in 1950 it has also become a pillar in pop culture thanks to the film Bells of Coronado, where Roy Rogue starred Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as two odd cowboys/scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that thing?"
Roger: “This is a Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put on the headphones, you can actually hear the effects of radioactivity on the atoms."

A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see" cancer cells and eliminate them
Inoculation teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells as part of treatment.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, and modifying the cells in the lab
Then cells can see a protein that is associated with many cancers and then injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
In one woman treated for a vaccine, which teaches the immune system to detect cancer cells, ovarian cancer disappears for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, modifying cells in the lab so that they can “see" a protein called HER2 which is shared with many cancer types, and then injecting the cells back into the patient.
Professor J. Brasofsky, of the National Cancer Institute of the United States in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
Her2 “starts the development of a number of cancers, including breast cancer, ovaries, visibility, and colon, explains Prof.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to attack cancer cells was successful in treating the type of leukemia.
Kenya West broke out in a support-trump reproof speech, with his head a MAGA hat, after his performance at SNL.
That didn't go well.
Kenya West responded with booing in the studio during a confused performance on the Saturday Night Live show, while praising US President Donald Trump and saying he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song on the show, called Ghost Town, which during his performance wore a Make America Great hat, he broke out in a reproof speech against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to white people who say, "How can you love Trump, is he racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL episode began with a sketch starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, regarding allegations of sexual assault raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the reproof speech was not broadcast on the show, the segment was put on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to roll on West in the release of the segment.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he suffered backstage criticism of the hat he wears.
“ They attacked me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out on the stage with that hat on your head."
They attacked me!
Then they said I was in a dark place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say: "Do you want to see the dark place?" by saying that he was "wearing my Superman hat, because that means no one can tell me what to do.
Try to show love."
His words were booed at least twice by the audience, and it seemed that members of the SNL staff were embarrassed, Variety reported, and one of them told the newspaper: "Silence of an abysmal fell in the entire studio."
West was attached to the show as a last-minute substitute instead of singer Ariana Grande, whose former partner, Mac Miller, had died just days earlier.
West Hmm many when performing the song I love it as he dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West gained support from the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the bravest souls: thank you for not giving in to the crowd."
But the Actual Program presenter Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West simply “was who he was and that's absolutely wonderful."
“ But I chose not to reward (by purchasing his music or clothing or supporting his "art") that I thought was an effort and propagates ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
And so did we," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that from now on he was “the entity formerly known as Kenya West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Papi and P Didi.
Another rapper, Snoop Doc, held the name Sanoff Lyon, and of course the noted musician Prince changed his name to sergeant and then artist who was formerly known as Prince.

The show's star Game of Thrones, Keith Harrington, attacks the toxic manhood
Kit Harrinton is recognized as Jon Snow swings swords from the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often convey to young children the message that they must be tough to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married another star at the Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31 years old, admitted to being → very troubled about handling this issue.
“ Personally, I feel very troubled right now — where were we wrong about manhood? ” he said.
“ What do we teach men during their growing years, from the point of view of the problem we are witnessing now?"
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity, due to the very masculine characters it presents.
He continued: “What comes from within, and what will we learn from outside?
What can we learn from television, and on the street, that makes young children feel they must be on this particular side of being a man?
I think that's really one of the great questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because there is no doubt that something has gone wrong for young men."
In an interview he admitted that he would not participate in any follow-up series or derivative series of Game of Thrones after the series ended next summer, saying that he had "done with battlefields and horses".
Beginning in November Keith will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's play . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The actor recently found out that he saw meeting his wife Rose as the best thing that happened as a result of Game of Thrones.
“ I knew my wife in the series, so in this way the series gave me my future family, and my life from then on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The two married in June 2018 at the Leslie estate yard in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China declared a 14% leap in its number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have the disease, thus providing official health factors.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
The great majority of new cases have been contracted as a result of sexual intercourse, which is a change compared to the past.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, according to official health factors in China at a conference in Yunnan County.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
Adhesion with HIV as a result of sexual intercourse constitutes a burning problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality ceased to be against the law in China in 1997, but it was said that the discrimination against the people of LGBT is broad.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70–90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of infection of the disease are the result of not using sufficient protection measures in these sexual relations.
Since 2003, the government of China has secured universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a man from her team leaked information about a Republican senator and condemns the "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
American Senator Maxine Waters rejected Saturday the allegations that a member of her staff posted personal information about three American senators on the Senators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democratic Senator estimated that the claims were distributed by websites and visitors "extremely right".
“ Lies, lies, and more vile lies, ” said Waters on Twitter.
Reportedly, the information published included the residence and telephone addresses of American Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the hearing before the Senate Committee on sexual misconduct charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh.
The leak took place some time after the three senators asked Cavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Fundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to Waters' office and posted the information on a member of the Waters staff, according to Hill's report.
“ This baseless accusation is completely incorrect and a total lie, ” Waters added.
“ A member of my staff — whose identity and personal details were revealed and his confidence were compromised by false accusations and errors — was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless accusation is completely wrong and a total lie."
Waters' announcement quickly drew criticism online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
“ This shows that she does not have the temperament required by members of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't react with anger.
He can't react defiantly.
He can't question the accuser's motives.
He must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer seemed to compare Fleischer's response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, whom visitors accused who seemed too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tries to defeat Waters in the mid-prime election, also brought up his thoughts on Twitter.
"Big if it's true," he tweeted.
In her announcement, Waters said that her office had addressed “the appropriate authorities and law enforcement officials regarding these false claims.
“ We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered, ” she continued, “and that they will stand trial for all their destructive and dangerous actions toward my crew members.
Review of the film â Johnny English 3.0 → – A weakened spy parody starring Rowan Atkinson
It is now common to search for meanings regarding Braxit in any new film with a British perspective, and it does seem fitting for this revival of the Action-Comedy parody in the G. Johnny English series – which began somewhere in 2003 with G. Johnny English and awoke back to life in 2011 with Johnny English returning.
Would an ironic self-slap on how worthless we are become our country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the gaping-eyed Johnny English and Rubber Face received another opportunity to spoil matters – and his name symbolizes more than anything it is a broad comedy work designed for film viewers in countries that do not speak English.
He is of course the stupid English agent, who despite his strange pretence to slick glare seems a little like Clouseau, a little Mister Bean and Plenty of this guy who donates a single note to the tune of the fire chariots in the opening text of the 2012 Olympics in London.
It is also originally based on the mysterious international passenger played by Atkinson in the forgotten television commercials for Barclaycard, which leaves chaos behind.
There's one or two nice minutes in the last edition of Johnny English.
I liked the part where Johnny English approaches the helicopter wearing a medieval armor suit, and the propeller blades ring for moments on his helmet.
Atkinson exhibits his comic physical abilities, but humor feels rather weak and strangely unnecessary, especially since the "serious" type of spy films such as 007 and an impossible task themselves now includes a comic component.
Humor feels like he's addressing children instead of adults, and for me, the crazy failed adventures of G.I.N. English are less brilliant and focused on Atkinson's silent film-style jokes in the character of Mr. Bean.
The film's plot begins when great danger threatens Britain.
A computer hacker penetrated the super-secret Internet network of British espionage, revealing the identity of all UK agents in the field, to the anxiety of the lead agent—a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a Prime Minister in an arrogant and combat-oriented form, already suffering a complete breakdown of political popularity: Emma Thompson does her best to fulfill the role of Teresa May, but she has little to work with from the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy has been exposed, she will have to bring someone back from retirement.
And that means the Rabbinical Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a school principal in a prestigious institution, but gives informal lessons in how to be an undercover spy: some good jokes here, with English offering an academy for spying in the school style of .
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former assistant to Mode Suffering Buff, which Ben Miller plays again.
Boof is now a man married to a submarine commander, in the role of an annoying squad queen" on which Vico Pepperdine is slightly wasted.
So Bateman and Robin of Her Majesty's secret service entry into a terrible mess returns to action, with them Pam Pam-Patal as a beautiful Ophelia Bultova played by Olga Korilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls back dangerously under the charms of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems – the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacey.
English and Boff begin their own Odyssey which is more a farce of two clowns: disguised as waiters, they set on fire a fancy French restaurant; they form a fancy French restaurant when they smuggle themselves in the grand yacht of Volta; and Anglicanst is a complete operator in his attempt to use a virtual reality scheme to learn the interior of Waltha's house.
There is no doubt that all efforts are made to lead to the final sequence, but despite the amiability and playfulness, it has a sense of television for children.
Pretty mediocre level.
And like the other J.W. English films, I couldn't help but think: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice with his talent?
The Labour Party denies making a plan for the British to work four days a week but get paid for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbin considers a revolutionary plan that the British will work four days a week – but will be paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants company managers to move savings as a result of the AI revolution (AI) to workers in the form of another rest day.
I mean, employees will have a three-day weekend, and they'll still get the same salary.
Sources said the idea would fit the company's economic agenda and its plans to tip the country in favor of the workers.
The Professional Union Congress supports moving to a four-day work week as a way the workers can enjoy the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: “A policy examination is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“ It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a ambition that corresponds to the party's approach to the rebalance of the economy in favor of the workers, as well as the total industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party called for a four-day work week during its general campaign in 2017.
However, the ambition is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “Four-day workweek is not party policy and the party does not consider it."
Labour candidate for Finance Minister John McDonnell used the party conference last week to draft his vision for a socialist revolution in economics.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to bite back power from "faceless executives" and "price raiders" in service companies.
From the finance candidate's plans, it is also suggested that current shareholders in water companies may not regain their full investment as the Labour government may make › reductions › on the grounds of displaying inappropriate behavior.
It also confirms that there are plans to bring workers into the board of companies and create a total-inclusion fund to transfer 10 percent of the private sector's capital to employees, who will pocket annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told the TV show "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh would change their minds
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court in at least a week, raising the question whether the investigation findings could convince which of the Republicans to withdraw his support.
In an idea aired Sunday on The 60 Minutes, reporter Scott Pelley asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina party counterpart.
“ Of course, ” Kennedy said.
"I said for the hearing, I said I talked to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that the accusation came up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, determined, unequivocal."
In contrast, Graham's vote appears to be engraved in stone.
“ I have already decided about Bert Cavanaugh and will need a blown accusation, ” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it strongly," Graham added, referring to Christine Blazi Ford.
“ And no one she mentioned could confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see how anything can change."
What is the World Citizens Festival and did it contribute anything to reduce poverty?
The New York Sabbath will date the World Citizens Festival, an annual music event with a most impressive list of stars that will appear and an equally impressive purpose of ending world poverty.
The World Citizens Festival, which takes place this seventh time, will bring to it tens of thousands of people who will flock to a large lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Gjant G. Jackson, Cardi B. and Sean Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real purpose of the event – to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The 2012 World Citizens Festival is a continuation of the World Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless willing to pay for a VIP card), concert islanders must complete a series of tasks, or “actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, calling, or other significant ways to help increase awareness for the purpose of ending poverty.
But how much success did the festival really accomplish, with only 12 more years ahead of him to fulfill its purpose?
Is the idea of giving a free ticket to a concert to people really a way to convince them to demand a call for action, or is it another case of "clictiveism" — people who feel like they're really affecting their signing a petition online or tweeting on Twitter?
Since 2011, the World Citizens Organization has said that it has documented more than 19 million “actions ” from its supporters, pushing for a variety of different goals.
He said these actions helped spur world leaders to declare commitments and policies that are equivalent to over 37 billion dollars that would affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by the year 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements as a result of its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already begun distribution or fundraising.
The group estimates that funds have been allocated so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key obligations include the Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and action personnel committed to "helping children grow to their full potential", promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help put an end to malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from ‘World Citizens'.
“ With support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and ‘World Citizens' like you, we can turn social justice on a subnutrition issue into a footnote in history," said Ambassador The Power of Notary Ultraman to the audience during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions had been made that called for Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the appropriation for the project, Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children with nutrition intervention.
In response to one of the questions common on their website that asks, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
› The people of the world replied: “It will be a long and difficult course — sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great movements before us of civil rights and opposition to apartheid, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
G.Net G. Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B. and Janelle Monet are among some of the shows that will be featured in the New York event this year, which will serve Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh J. Kaman.
The U.S. can use the Navy for a "marine quarantine" to delay the export of Russian energy - the Interior Minister
“ If necessary", Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy reaching for markets, including the Middle East, revealed U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zink, as quoted in the Washington Examiner.
Zinz argued that the Russian involvement in Syria—which became, important to mention, in ordering the legal government—it would be an excuse to spread to new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to mediate energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said according to the report.
And according to the official source, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“ The United States is able, with our fleet, to make sure that the seaways are open and when necessary to lay siege to make sure that their energy sources do not reach the market, ” he said.
Zinxi addressed the attendees at an event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group defining itself as "the voice of the energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued his words and compared Washington's attitudes to dealing with Russia and Iran, stating that they were indeed the same.
“ The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, leverage and replacement of fuel types," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come when the Trump administration embarked on a mission to boost its condensed natural gas export to Europe, replacing Russian energy sources, which are a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's officials, including the President of the United States, Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw its participation in the "unsuitable" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, according to Trump, made Moscow's "sponsor".
Moscow has often emphasized that the Nord Stream Pipeline project 2, which cost $11 billion and that should double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion m2, is only an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's decisive opposition to the project is motivated solely for financial reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“ I believe that we share the opinion that energy cannot be a tool for stress management and consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," said Russian energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting in Moscow with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, in September.
The U.S. position received a severe counter-reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industry Organization (BDI), the leading organization in the German Industrial Sector, called for the US to stay away from the European Union Energy Policy and from the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“ I have a big problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kampf, head of the German Industrial Organization (BDI) following a final meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin.

The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "consider seriously" the possibility of running for president after the midterm election.
Warren confirmed the intention of running for president during a meeting at Holyoke Township, Massachusetts.
“ It is time for women to come to Washington to repair our broken administration, and to do so, it is necessary for a woman to take the lead," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider the presidential race".
Warren expressed her opinion of President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying that he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.
I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren strongly criticized Trump for the appointment of Brett Cavanaugh as a justice in the Supreme Court.
In a tweet published on day and day, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before voting".
However, a survey published on the day of the ‘showed that most of Warren's own constituents do not think she should run for the 2020 election.
Fifty-eight percent of voters "potential" in Massachusetts said that the Senator should not run for election, according to a survey by the Centre for Political Research of Suffolk University and the University of Boston Globe newspaper.
Thirty-two percent supported the intent of running for senator's presidency.
The survey showed that there was more support for former Governor Duval Patrick's run, with 38 percent that supported his running option against 48% who opposed it.
Famous figures from the Democratic Party whose name rose in connection with a possible run for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Bidden said he would make an official decision in January, according to IP agency reports.
Sarah Palin cites Trak Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump's rally
26-year-old Truck Palin spent a year in Iraq after his enlistment into the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence a day at night.
“ What my son has been going through, what he has been going through since he returned, allows me to identify with families experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are returning to, ” she told the audience participating in the rally for Donald Trump in the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other veterans, "they come back slightly different, they return rigidly, they come back and wonder if what they gave the country their soldiers and airmen, and all the other military personnel, is honored.

18 Countries and District of Columbia support the challenge of the new state asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to the fleeing victims from situations involving gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and district filled out a "member of the court" type deposition on Day and ‘ Washington in order to support the challenge of asylum seekers' policies, according to the NBC report.
The full name of the complainant in the case of Grace v. Sessions, who submitted the American Civil Rights Association in August, was not disclosed.
She said that her “violent partner, ” members of the gang, abused her but officials in the U.S. government rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace's state defenders described the states of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, of which numerous requests for asylum are served in the United States, as nations dealing with many problems regarding gangs and family violence.
The new U.S. state asylum policy abolished a 2014 decision by the BIA Council for immigration appeals that allowed immigrants without escape certificates from domestic violence situations, to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement on the day and ‘that the new policy ‘is ignoring tens of years of state law, federal and international laws'.
“ Federal law requires that all discussions regarding the asylum requests of the state will rely on the special facts and circumstances of the request, and the barrier placed by the new policy violates that principle," states the court's friend's statement.
The lawyers also argued in a statement that the policy, preventing the introduction of immigrants, is damaging the U.S. economy, as they tend to become entrepreneurs and "provide needed work", according to them.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant political asylum to victims fleeing from domestic abuse and gang violence situations in June.
“ The asylum is open to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a specific social group or due to political opinion," said Saschens in a message about the policies he delivered on June 11.
The goal of state asylum was never to ease all the problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.

I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're in a safe place."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with › propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in American Dayon, while an aggressive promotion of the U.S. and China trade benefits, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump, referring on the last Wednesday to a paid supplement of the Chinese newspaper China Daily, in the 2003 Moine Register : The best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa – after accusing China of attempting an intervention in the U.S. Congress election on November 6th, claimed that China had been rejected.
Trump's accusation of China attempted to intervene in the U.S. elections, marked a new stage, according to U.S. official sources, on the escalation campaign run by Washington with the aim of putting pressure on China.
Although foreign governments are natural to publish ads for the promotion of trade, Beijing and Washington are now stuck in a Goa trade war in which each country raises and compares customs rates on its imported products from its rival.
Customs tariffs, which China raised as retaliation early in the trade war, were intended to harm exporters from countries such as Iowa who supported the Trump Republican Party, said American and Chinese experts.
Terry Bernstad, U.S. Ambassador to China, a former governor of Iowa for many years, and an important exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had damaged workers, farmers, and American businesses.
China, Bernstad wrote in an opinion article in a Sunday edition of The Des Moines Regjister, “published the acts of bullying by publishing ads in our free press.
“ In spreading its propaganda, the government of China uses the tradition of free speech and the precious press of America, and publishes a paid ad in Des Moines Regjister," wrote Bernstad.
“ On the counter, at the newsstand on the streets of Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflections of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on the alarming economic route, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s prominent newspapers had eluded the offer to publish ” his article, although he did not say what newspaper it was.
GOP distances women's votes before mid-term elections with the Cavanaugh incident, warning analysts
While many GOP leaders stand by the candidate Brett Cavanaugh and defend him in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned that they would see a counter-reaction, especially from women, during the next mid-term election.
The feelings surrounding the matter were particularly vivid, and most Republicans officially demonstrate their desire to move forward in the voting process.
“ This kind of thing cannot be turned back, ” said Grant Rieher, a lecturer in political science at Syracuse University School for The Hill newspaper in an article published on Saturday.
Rieher said he doubted that Senator J.F. Flake's last-minute efforts (from the Arizona Republican Party) to launch an FBI investigation, would suffice to appease angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday – they are not going to forget it tomorrow or November", said on the day and ‘Karin Zjen-Pierre, senior advisor and national speaker of the Progressive Movement Mov-on, according to the newspaper Tsarn Zhepierre D.C.
On the morning of day and day, protesters cried out "November Arrival" as they protested in the Senate corridor, while Republicans ruling the Senate Judiciary Committee chose to continue promoting Cavanaugh's appointment, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaisy Ford, according to a report by the Mick website.
“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation levels will break new records," said the news site Stu Rutenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
“ People say they were already high; they were right.
But they can be higher, especially among floating voices of women in the suburbs and among young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who despite their lack of sympathy for the president, are often prevented from voting".
Even prior to Ford's public testimony, which detailed her allegations as to the sexual assault of the High Court candidate, analysts argued there would be a counter-reaction if Republicans continued to promote the nomination's approval.
"The appointment caused Republicans to serious entanglement," said Michael Steele, chairman of the former Republican National Committee, early last week, the NBC News Channel reported.
“ It is not just the committee's vote or the final vote or whether Cavanaugh gets the nomination, but also the way Republicans handled it and the way they treated it," noted the news channel Guy Cecil, director of USA Priorities, a group that assists in selecting Democrats.
However, Americans seem to differ somewhat on the extent of their belief in the testimony of Ford and Cavanaugh, with slightly higher support for Ford.
A final survey of YouGov, shows that 41 percent of the restorers believed for certain or probably for Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed for certain or probably for Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was lying for sure or probably during his testimony, while only 30% said so about Ford.
After the pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as allegations made by at least one more complainer, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian newspaper reports.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Cavanaugh attacked her while drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez argues that the Supreme Court candidate revealed Eber Mino to her during a party where they participated during their time at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web Network plans to start a new web network to beat Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web Network, launches a start-up company in order to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of the man who became a legend in the technology world, is a company that will open Solid, the Berners-Lee Open Code Platform.
Solid platform allows its users to choose where their data will be stored and who people allowed to access the different data types.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the meaning behind Inrupt is "control of the world".
“ We have to do it now, ” he said about the start-up.
“ This Is a Historic Moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create a "personal online database" or POD.
The reservoir could include a list of contacts, lists of operations for execution, schedule, music library and other personal and professional tools.
Imagine Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify being available all on one browser, simultaneously.
What distinguishes the personal online database is that the user alone will decide who can access the information and what kind of information can be accessed.
The company calls it personal empowerment through data.
According to the words of John Bruce, the company's CEO, it means that Inrupt will find the resources, process, and capabilities suitable to assist in impacting Solid for all.
Today the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a team featuring several developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer code programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world will be able to create distributed apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team do not discuss “Facebook and Google their consent or refusal to instill a complete change, which will result in a complete and overnight makeover in all their business models.
“ We do not ask their permission.
In a post published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission “is to provide commercial energy and an environmental system to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the face of the Internet when he established the network's standard organization, W3C at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in discussing network neutrality.
Also during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as the founder and organization manager W3C, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“ I am particularly optimistic about the next age of the network, ” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Event to mark the cleric who won the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only cleric from the Anglican Church to have won, as a warrior, the Victoria Cross during World War I was noted in an event held in his hometown, 100 years after the win.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Van, won the Victoria Cross on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Belenglies and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned he had won the highest British merit badge.
A commemorative stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren, in a parade held in Rashden, in Northampton County, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that exposing the stone exactly 100 after his grandfather won the merit badge is “excellently symbolic".
According to the London Gazette newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his regiment and crossed the San Cantan Canal “through heavy fog and under heavy fire from field tensions and machine gun subs.
He then rushed to the line of fire and "greatest gallantry" led the line forward before rushing to take one hand over a machine gun and dropped three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – one month before the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Van, said that his grandfather's actions were “something I know I could never match but something that humbles me.
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also laid a bouquet after the parade, which led the Brentwood Royal Youth Orchestra.
Michael Van said that he “felt a great deal of respect for taking part in the chart" and added "the bravery of a true hero is displayed in support that will be given to many people.
Combined martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch the 206 Balator, and instead received Peppe Pig
Imagine staying up all night to watch the action of Baltor 206 and eventually watching the main event was excluded from you.
The San Jose program included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was featured live during the night on Channel 5 British.
At 6 a.m., just as Jagard Musasi and Rory McDonald prepared for battle, the UK viewers were shocked as coverage changed to Pepe Pig.
Some of them were unimpressed by the change after staying up until the early morning especially to watch the fight.
One fan on Twitter described the transition to the children's cartoon as "a sort of sick joke".
“ It was a government ordinance that states that at 6 a.m. the original content was not appropriate so they had to go to the children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, a senior vice president of marketing and communication in the Balator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppe Pig, yes".
The president of the Blatur Company, Scott Coker, said they intend to work on their schedules to include in them the future British viewers.
"I think that when I think about the replay, I think we can probably work this out," said Coker.
“ But it is 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday, and we will not be able to solve the problem until Sunday ‘ in our time zone, that is, a day in ‘ their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, during the transition, a lot of text messages were exchanged between the parties and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it. We thought it was a technical malfunction.
But no, it was a government problem.
I can assure you next time it's not going to happen.
We'll only have five fights instead of six - like we usually do - we tried to give the fans more and we just overdid it.
It's a matter of misfortune."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Tom Daly, the Olympic water jumper, said that while growing up he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexual orientation—but that feeling gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old jumper said he didn't know until he got to middle school that "not everyone's like me".
In an interview he gave on Desert Island Discos, of Radio Channel 4, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he expressed himself on the issue of gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
The regular host of the long-time program, Kristi Young, went on a several-month sick leave.
In his appearance as the star of Laverne's first show, Daley said that he felt “comfortable ” from the others when he grew up that“ it was socially unacceptable to love boys and girls.
He said: “To this day, the feelings of inferiority, and the feeling of differentness, were real things that gave me the strength and power and allowed me to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so that he would not let everyone down when he finally found out what his sexual orientation was.
The man who won the Olympic bronze medal twice became a highly acclaimed leader of the LGBT community campaign and used his participation in the British Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to grant legal status to homosexuality.
He openly expressed himself on the subject because he felt lucky that he was given the opportunity to live openly and without consequences and wanted to give others “hope. ”
The Triple World Championship winner said that falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “surprised me by surprise.
Daly married the Oscar winner, 20 years older than him, last year but he said the age gap was never a problem.
“ When you go through so much at such a young age" — He participated in the Olympic Games for the first time at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later — he said it was difficult to find someone his age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray BlackDaily, and Daly said that his "all perspective" had changed.
“ If you had asked me last year, it all revolved around › I should have won a gold medal, ” he said.
“ You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Ruby".
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daly said that his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 Olympic Games in London – that he wanted to be in the front row.
“ I couldn’t tell him you wouldn’t be here to be in the front row, Father," he said.
“ I held his hand while his breath stopped and it was only when he stopped breathing in the truth that I finally recognized that he was not invincible, ” he said.
The following year, Daly competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
“ I just knew that's what I've been dreaming about my whole life -- diving in front of a home audience at the Olympic Games, he said.
It is also what inspired him to choose his first song – the Proud of Heather Small – with whom he identified himself during preparations for the Olympic Games and which still makes him duck-skinned.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 p.m., according to British Summer Time.
Michaelson failed in performance and got off the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American golfer Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday] When he plays for the 47th time in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to upgrade performance so the event doesn't become a miserable milestone.
Michaelson, who participates in the biannual event for the 12th time and sets a record, dropped to the bench according to the decision of G. J. Fyrick during the Four Balls and Four Balls (forsomes) on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as his practice in playing games with the United States national team, Michaelson, who won five times in the Major Tournament, spent half the day as a cheerleader and the second half working on his playing margins in hopes of fixing the ill evil from which he suffered.
Even at the height of his career, the player's performance suffered from downs and ups.[citation needed] Thus, 48-year-old Michaelson is not the ideal choice for "La Golf National", in which the long grass tracks are not usually forgiving for stray batting.
And if the competition itself isn't deterrent enough, Michaelson, in the ninth game of the first day, competed against the Exactly British champion, Francesco ‘Scoe Molinari, who collaborated with the starting player Tommy Fleetwood and won all four of their games this week.
If the ambition of Americans, who lost four points in the early 12 individual games, was to succeed in the first stages, Michaelson's game could have been decisive.
Fjorick expressed confidence in his player, though we did not expect him to say anything else.
“ He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, wrapped his arm around me, and said he would be ready tomorrow, ” said Fjorick.
“ He has a lot of confidence.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has added a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but that's how it turned out and that's how we thought we should proceed.
He wanted to be on the track, just like all the other players."
Michaelson will break Nick Paldo's record with the highest number of games in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may be the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never really matched his personal peaks.
Michaelson's credit stands 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, though Fjorick said his presence added certain intangible benefits to the team.
“ He is amusing, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of people, and he is fun to be in the dressing room with, ” he explained.
“ I think the younger players also enjoyed playing with him this week, and it was nice to see it.
It has much more to it than the game itself."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great advantage may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from a significant advantage prior to the last day of the Raider Cup's only games may change badly.
The Danish player started his way in the 1997 game at Valdrama, with his playmate, Seb Ballesteros, had a 5 point lead on the Americans, which he lost almost crossing the finish line with a minor lead and won 141°2′131′′2.
“ I keep reminding myself that we had a great advantage at Valderrama; that we had a great advantage in the game in Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Walderama where we won but with a minor advantage," said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching the 5–3 victory, in the 2018 tournament both day and yesterday, leading to a 10–6 lead at La Golf.
“ So history will prove to me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
We have to give it all up tomorrow.
We need to get out on the track and do all the right things.
It's not over until the dots are on the board.
We have a goal, to try to win the Cup, and we need to focus on it.
I said all along, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are very aware of those who are standing in front of us on the other side -- the best players in the world."
Bjorn was happy with the performance of his players on the hard golf course, adding: “It is important that I never get ahead of myself when it comes to golf.
Tomorrow could totally different.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on the individual performance, which is completely different.
It's a pleasure to be on the track when everything goes well, but when you're out there alone, then your full ability as a golfer stands the test.
And this is the message to the players: you have to make the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to make the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, rival team captain Jim Fjorick will expect better personal performance from his players, compared to their performance in the doubles games, except for Jordan Sepith and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Fjorick himself knows both the winning side and the losing side, during the important closing days of this type of tournaments, having participated in the Brooklyn winning team before losing, with the European team miraculously winning the final game, as recorded in the film "Miracles at Medinah".
“ I remember every word, ” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players toward the last day.
“ We have 12 important games tomorrow, but I want to make it through the early stages, as you have seen in Brooklyn, and as you have seen at Medinah.
When this momentum moves to one side, it exerts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We're preparing our lineup accordingly and putting the guys on track by the way we feel we have, you know, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the fight and he would face Rory McElroy in the summit game, with Paul Cassay, J.S. Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Folter, who are the other Europeans at the top half ranking.
“ I chose the cast in that order because I think he can get us to the finish, ” said Bjorn, referring to his only choice.
The acceptance of Germany's new warship was rejected once more.
Germany's new naval frigate was scheduled to be accepted in 2014 to replace the aging warships from the Cold War period, but it was rejected in at least a year, due to damaged systems and reduced cost, the local media outlets reported.
The acceptance of Rheinland-Pfalz, the leading ship on the new Baden-Wuertberg-Class line, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper D-Tait which cited a military spokesman.
The vessel was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but alarming issues after the supplies closed the roll on the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuertemberg-Class, which the Navy ordered back in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are expected to include a powerful cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile batteries as well as stealth technologies, such as acoustic signatures, infrared and reduced radar.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the newest frigates could be deployed for up to two years away from the naves of the house.
However, the meaning of repeated delays is that the innovative ships—which should allow Germany to send troops overseas—will already become obsolete by the time they enter the service, noted quite a cit.
The F125 Lucky Shame frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to build ships after its delivery.
Not much is known about the reasons behind the recall, but the German media cited from a critical ‘ software and hardware eclipses that made the warship useless for the use of a battle mission.
The software impairments were particularly important as the Baden-Wuertemberg-class naval tools would be operated by about 120 sailors—about half the crew used in the older frigates, of the Bremen Class.
In addition, it was revealed that the ship has a dramatic overweightness that reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The weight of the ship Rheinland-Pfalz is 7,000 tons, and is twice as heavy as ships of similar type used by the Germans in World War II.
Besides the poor software, the price label of the project rule – which also includes staff training – also becomes a problem.
It is rumored to have reached a shocking height of 3.1 billion euro (US$3.6 billion) – beyond the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that fascinate the newest frigates become particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartles, the head of the German Parliament Security Commission, confirmed that today, the Navy is now "out of ship's supply capable of deployment".
The official source said the problem gained acceleration and increased over time, as old ships were decommissioned but were not replaced by other vessels.
He expressed his regret for not being able to join the Navy no Baden-Woertemberg-class frigate.
The National Foundation of Scotland Listens to the Secret Life of the Bats
A new study conducted at the estate in the Highlands of Scotland aims to reveal the way bats use the landscape to hunt their food.
The hope is that the findings will newly illuminate the behavior of the unique flying mammals and will help guide future conservation activities.
The study conducted by scientists at the National Foundation of Scotland will follow common bats and European telephones as well as brown, ear-long Dubnton bats in Inberio Gardens in Worcester Ross.
Special recording devices will be located on key sites around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
The National Health Service staff (NHS) and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using manual detectors.
An specialized sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequencies of bat readings and which of the species is responsible for them.
In the next phase, a living areas map will be drawn to create a detailed image in the order of the landscape's surface, of their behavior patterns.
Rob Dewar, Natural Conservation Advisor for the National Foundation of Scotland (NTS) hopes the results will find out which living areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the advantages of the management work of the habitats, such as the creation of meadow vineyards and how to best maintain forest spaces for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have greatly decreased during the previous century.
They are under threat from development and construction work, which affects nesting and the loss of living areas.
Wind turbines and lighting may also pose a risk, and this is also true of fly traps and certain chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks from house cats.
Actually, the bats aren't blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, bats ears are more useful when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated technique of echo-tracking to locate insects and identify obstacles to their flight path.
The NTS Foundation, responsible for handling over 270 historic buildings, 38 important genes and 760,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
She has 10 skilled experts, who fluently conduct surveys, nesting tests, and sometimes rescue.
The organization also established the first and only reserve dedicated to bats at the T‘Rival Estate in Dampriz and Galloway, which serves as home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Manor manager David T. Thompson said the estate is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at T.R.I.E., we have a great area for the bats," he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the proper living areas.
But many things are not yet known about the bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us understand more what they need to thrive."
He emphasized the importance of testing to find the bats before performing maintenance work within the assets, as the unintentional destruction of a single populated nest may destroy up to 400 females and cubs, and may also destroy an entire local population.
The bats are a protected and killing species, harassment and disruption to bats or destruction of their nesting areas, legally prohibited.
Elizabeth : Pearl, a Scottish official at the bat conservation fund, encouraged the public to shoulder and help.
She said: “We have much more to learn about our bats and many of our species. We just don’t know the state of their populations."
Ronaldo dismisses the rape charges as the lawyers prepare to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape charges against him "Pike News", saying that people "want to promote themselves" through using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Çdar Spiegel, who has released the charges.
The striker of the Portugal and Juventus constituency was accused of raping an American woman named Katharine Mirga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He suspected that he then paid her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Dr. Spiegel reported on the day and ‘.
33-year-old Ronaldo turned to his 142 million followers on Instagram in the video lived several hours after publishing the claims and booed the "Fike News" reports.
“ No, no, no, no, no.
What they said yesterday, Pike News, said to the camera the player who won balloon d'Or five times.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all is well," added the actor with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations, to which they referred to as an "unacceptable report of suspicions in the field of privacy", according to Reuters' report.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for “a moral damage in the amount that matches the severity of the breach, and this is probably one of the most severe violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident occurred according to the June 2009 claim in the suite of the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mirga returned, according to the report, to the actor's room and actor allegedly raped her, according to documents filed in Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mirga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her that he was a "good guy" in "99 percent" who had failed at "one percent".
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed the couple had sex, but that they were consensual.
Muurga also claims that she had gone to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but that she subsequently agreed to a settlement outside the courts because she felt “shocked by acts of vengeance" and was afraid of being“ publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old girl says she is now interested in repealing the arrangement as she is still suffering from trauma due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and moved summer to the Italian Juventus Club in a deal worth 100 million euros.
Brackzit: Britain will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
Britain will regret forever" if you lose its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after the Breczit, UK Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that Toyota UK's interview to the BBC, in which she said that if Britain left the European Union without an agreement it would stop production at its factory in Branston, near Derby, would be "concerning".
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effect of delays within borders in the case of Breczit without an agreement may rise in jobs.
The plant in Branston – producing the Oris and Aventis models of Toyota – produced close to 150,000 vehicles last year and of which 90% were exported to the other EU countries.
"According to my point of view, if Britain comes out without an agreement from the European Union at the end of March, we will see the production break at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Branston.
Additional car manufacturers in the UK raised concerns about leaving the European Union without an agreement and how would affect the cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW Company, for example, says it will shut down its "mini" factory in Oxford, for a month after the Breckazit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call 1⁄2 risks of the supply chain ‘in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is run on a "right on time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes, providing British and other European Union, for the production of cars on order.
If Britain leaves the European Union without an agreement on March 29, there may be boundary disruptions, and sector factors say they may lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota won't be able to hold a stock worth more than one day at a factory in Derbyshire, says the company, and therefore production will be discontinued.
Clark said that Teresa May's . . . . program, detailing Britain's future relations with the EU, “is precisely calibrated to prevent these tests at the border.
We want to reach the best agreement possible, as I said, not only to enjoy success in the present, but also to take advantage of the opportunity," he said on the Today Show on BBC Radio 4.
“ The evidence from Toyota and other car manufacturers is that the possibility of continuing the successful array of supply chains that we have at our disposal to this day is absolutely essential.
Toyota did not say how long the production break would last, but in the longer term, she warned that the additional costs would damage factory competitions and would eventually result in dismissal.
Peter Tsovalaris, who had worked in Branston for 24 years, and serving as president of the United States Union in the factory, said that union members are increasingly concerned: “From my experience, if jobs are reduced, they will never be returned.
A government spokesman said: “We proposed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who many depend on, may “be postponed another week ” while the fight for the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Cavanaugh, continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, ties between Trump aides and Russia and possible disruption of investigation proceedings by the President.
Washington gossip has been about whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General and risk Muller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a wire to record the conversations with Trump and cause the President's oust through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on the last day, he came to the White House, and reportedly was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for the day of the ‘Trump, who stayed at the time of Rosenstein's arrival at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would rather not fire Rosenstein but at this point the meeting was postponed to prevent a clash with the hearing on the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which Cavanaugh testified and one of the women accusing him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On the day and ‘, Trump ordered an investigation of the FBI for a week regarding the allegations against Cavanaugh, and repulsed the vote in the Senate.
Trump's spokesperson, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
In answer to the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “No date has been set for the meeting yet, it may take place this week, and I can see a postponement for another week given the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'm always happy to update the press."
Some reporters will appeal this determination: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the frequency of briefings did not result from the "taking a stand" of television reporters, although she said: "I will not deny the fact that they are taking a stand.
She then offered to increase the direct link between Trump and the press.
“ The president holds more questions and answers than any president before him, ” she said, adding without quoting evidence: “We have checked the numbers.
The press briefings will still take place, Sanders said, but “If the press has an opportunity to present questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do so in many cases, and you've seen that we've done so in many cases over the past few weeks, and sessions that will allow the President of the United States to talk to the United States, will replace the press briefings."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences while visiting dignitaries.
His press conferences alone are rare.
This week in New York City, the president may have demonstrated the reason for this, at a released and at times odd performance in front of reporters gathered instead.
The Health Server writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland and addresses concerns about Braxit
The health minister wrote to the EU staff, employed in the National Health Service of Scotland, to express the country's gratitude and to request that they remain after the Brexit.
Scottish Parliamentary Member Gene Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before the exit of Britain from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already pledged to stand the cost of permanent status requests for European Union citizens working in its distributed public services.
Ms. ‘ Freeman wrote in her letter: “Over the summer, the negotiations between Britain and the European Union about the departure continued, and he progressed toward the upcoming decisions in the fall.
But the British government also increased its preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know this time can be very disturbing for all of you.
So I wanted to go back and say how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the team, regardless of his citizenship.
Fellows from all over the European Union and the world, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is obviously your home and we want you to stay here very much."

Foreign buyers will be charged with higher stamp tax while buying property in Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher stamp tax while buying property in the UK and the addition of revenue will be used to help homeless people, according to the new Conservative program.
The move will neutralize Corbin's move success to attract new voters.
The incident of stamp tax will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects the tax to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will charge at a higher rate of stamp tax when they buy property in the UK – the addition of revenue will be used to help the homeless, declare Teresa May today.
The move appears to be an attempt to counteract the move success of Gjrmy Corbin to attract young voters, with promises to provide cheaper housing and focus on higher revenue holders.
The stamp tax will be imposed on people and companies who don't pay taxes in the UK, and the addition of revenue will strengthen the government's move to help those who are old under difficult conditions.
The payment, which comes as an addition to the current stamp tax, including higher tax levels on secondary residence and real estate investments for rentals – may reach a height of three percent.
The Treasury expects the march to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
According to the estimate, 13 percent of the new properties built in London are acquired by foreign residents, a situation that causes price increases and makes it difficult for people who first purchase an asset to set foot on the housing ladder.
Many wealthy areas in the country—and especially in the capital—became "ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris G. Johnson called for the stamp tax cut to help young people acquire a first home.
He accused large building companies of taking land but not using it, and urged the back to ‘ May to abandon the quotas on affordable homes and to repair Britain’s housing reproach.
Corbin announced a series of attractive reforms offered in the housing field, including rent control and the cessation of evacuations “without guilt.
He also wants to give councils greater power to build new homes.
Mae said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my term of office to restoring the British dream — that it was more important for life to be better for each new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unjust that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies based in foreign countries, could purchase homes of the same ease as hard-working British residents.
The dream of becoming landlords has become too far away for too many people, and the humiliation of sleeping in difficult conditions is too realistic".
J.K. Ross: My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland"
Director of Sunderland G. K. Ross said his ultimate ambition was to become Director of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman relishes the North East Club CPR challenge, currently in third place in the First Division, three points away from the ranking advance.
He moved to the Summer Light Stadium after leading St Mirren back to first place in Scotland in the last season.
I wanted to play for my country as an actor.
I once participated in an international game and that's it," Ross said to the Scottish BBC program Sportsound.
But when I was growing up, I watched the Scotland team play a lot of Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it was always something that drew me back.
Anyway, this opportunity will only come if I manage the team."
The previous managers of Sunderland include Dick Egbelt, David Moise, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Foya, and Paolo di Canio.
Aloha Athletic's former manager says he was not afraid to come after such established names in such a large club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich' Town.
"For me, success will now be measured by Ç Can I return the club to Premier League?".
Because of the structure and facilities in this club, it certainly belongs to Premier League," he said.
“ It is not an easy task to get him there, but I can only see myself as a success story here if I can get the club back there.
Ross began his management career only three years ago, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbberton and 15 months as team coach for the Hearts Group.
He next helped Aloa out of Liga G. ‘ and raised St. Mirren from the brink of the abyss to her position as champion of the championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his acting career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkirk, St Mirne and Hamilton Academical.
“ It was probably a real node, ” he recalled, about taking command of Eloa.
“ I really believed that management was more appropriate than the game.
It sounds weird because I played fine, earned reasonably, and enjoyed a few reasonable records.
But an actor's career can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still dealing with them when it comes to stress and stress at work, but management just feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, and I've never felt more comfortable with myself as an adult."
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound, Sunday : September 30, on Scotland Radio between 12:00 and 13:00, according to British Summer Time
The perfect time for a pint of beer is at 5:30 on Saturday, in the poll.
The summer heat wave increased profits of the British pubs struggling for their existence, but caused pressure on the restaurant networks.
Groups of pubs and bars enjoyed an increase in sales at a height of 2.7 percent in July – but the revenues in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent, revealed the data.
Peter Martin, of the CGA Business Advisory Company, who compiled the data, said: “The significance of the bright weather continuity and long participation from England's expected participation in the World Championships is that July had a pattern similar to June's, in that the pub revenues increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants suffered an even harder blow.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant trade observed in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focusing on beverages recorded the strongest performance, with a higher increase than the revenue decline in the restaurant business, compared to the previous period.
Food-focused pubs also suffered from the sun, although their condition was less dramatic than that of restaurant operators.
Seems like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars networks, the liquor sales percentage increased 6.6% over the month, and the food sales contracts dropped by three percent".
Paul Newman, author of RSM for recreational and hosting data analysis, said: “These results have continued the trend we have seen since late April.
Weather and the influence of sporting events or important social events are the most important factors regarding the outdoor recreation market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle, though a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to last year, will be particularly painful in addition to all regular costs pressures.
The long, warm summer could not have come at a worse moment for food-focused businesses, and time would tell if the milder temperatures experienced in August would result in a respite of what, which they needed so much for".
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, stood at 2.7 percent in July, and reflected a slowdown in brand launch.

One of every five children has social media accounts they hide from their parents.
A survey revealed that one out of every five children – some of them only 11 years old – have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey, which included 20,000 middle school students revealed an increase in fake "insta" pages
The news has increased concerns about the publication of sexual content
20 percent of students said they had a "principle" account that they show parents
One of five children – some of them are only 11 years old – creates accounts on social media that he keeps secret from adults.
A survey consisting of 20,000 middle school students revealed rapid growth in counterfeit Insta accounts – as a reference to the photo-sharing site, Instagram.
The news has increased concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said that they operate a clean "prime" account to show their parents, but that they also have private accounts.
A mother who encountered the secret account of her 13 - year - old teenage daughter found that she was asking others to “rape me. ”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the School Administration Association (HMC) of the UK Independent Schools found 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles and half of them admit to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Bucanan said: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them.
Eild Doyle will serve as "voice for athletes" on the Scottish Athletic Board
Ailed Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletic Board as an outside minister in the annual board general meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated light athletic athlete and Chairman Ian Beatty has described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those who guide sports to benefit from her internationally rich experience over the past decade.
“ Ealid has been honored by the Scottish, British, and World Athletic Community, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit greatly from your coming to the board," Beatty said.
Doyle said: “I am thrilled to serve as a voice for athletes and hope that I can contribute and truly help with the guidance of sports in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200 and 400 m races at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, and four Olympic gold medals overall, and is now used regularly as a commentator on the BBC network, lost his ability to walk after suffering a passing stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or to what extent.
It was hard labor, but I fully recovered, relearned how to walk and is currently performing quick exercises and reaction speed!
Thanks for the pep talk!
Publicity for milk pumps comparing mothers to online party cows
A company for milk pumps split opinions online with an ad comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
To indicate the launch of the pump that should be “the world’s first quiet and clothingable milk pump", the technology company for private users Elvie, released a humorous video ad to demonstrate the freedom of action that the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay to a song that included words such as: “Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed it's not bristles, but my breasts."
The chorus of the song goes on to say: "Suck, pump, I feed the babies, pump, suck, I milk my girls".
But the ad, published on the company's Facebook page, caused a controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of responses, the video received mixed responses from viewers, and many said it sheds light on the milk industry's "terrorities".
“ A very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and have a baby to make milk, but their babies are stolen from them within days of the litter," wrote someone.
Elvie's milk pump discreetly blends into the breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment stated: “Traumatically to the cow and calf alike.
But hey, why not use them to advertise a milk pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?"
Another comment said: "Advertisement is completely cut off".
Others defended the commercial, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was "laughing".
“ I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
The suction made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I was referring to her content.
It's a genius product," wrote someone.
Another comment said: This is a funny commercial designed for mothers who pump (often in their workplaces or bathrooms) and feel like cows.
It's not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group discovers that they were all dancing with the discreet pumps inside their bras.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women, who use milk pump, say they feel like cows.
But Elvie's pump is completely quiet, without pipes and wires, it secretly blends in the breast breast breast breast breast and gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out while pumping.
Anna Blarin, a co-manager of the early development department in childhood in Mother, noted: “A Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
In creating the comparison between women expressing themselves and dairy cows, we wanted to place the milk pumping and all the challenges it has in the spotlight, and demonstrate entertainingly, with which it can be identified, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will give.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the track for designer Martha Jacobowski using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children were quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of immigrant children in custody increased although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, and one of the reasons for this is that Trump's discourse and policy made the transfer of children to sponsors difficult.
Generally, most sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and were afraid to risk their ability to remain in the country by applying for responsibility for a child.
The risk increased in June, as federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult households would have to hand over fingerprints, and that these figures would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior immigration and throne official, testified before Congress that the Authority arrested dozens of people who applied for unsupervised minor sponsorship.
The Authority subsequently approved 70 percent of detainees had no prior criminal record.
“ Nearly 80 percent of their sponsors or households are in the country illegally, and many of them are criminals from foreign countries.
That's why we keep chasing these people," Mr. Albans said.
In order to address solutions for the children more quickly, officials introduced new laws that would require some of them to appear before a court within a month of their arrest, rather than after 60 days as acceptable according to previous regulations, shelter workers reported.
Many will appear through video conference call, instead of face-to-face, to present their arguments for receiving legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are not found eligible for release will be quickly deported.
The longer these children remain under cover, the more likely they are to develop anxiety and depression, and this situation may lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, said the shelter workers and reports that have been published from the system in recent months.
Consultants say these fears increase in larger facilities such as Tournillo, where it is likely that signs of the child's difficulties will be neglected, due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving the children to tent town without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or to break up with friends could make the trauma that many have already faced worse.
Syria tells the American, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately.
Turning to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Usema also called for Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Improved, also serving as Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally, under the excuse that they are fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly".
“ They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally, ” he told the rally.
His employer insisted that the "war on terror was almost over" in Syria, in which over 360,000 people had died since 2011 and millions more were displaced from their home.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we purge the Syrian lands" from terrorist organizations and from "any illegal foreign presence that is" alike.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and consulting for Kurdish and Syrian forces opposing the president asher al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 fighters on the war-ridden country soil.
As far as the refugee issue was concerned, he said that the conditions for their return were good and accused “some Western countries ” of spreading irrational fears that prompted refugees to stay away.
“ We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to assist their return, ” he said.
They're politicalizing the issue that's supposed to be humanitarian only".
The United States and the EU warned that no assistance would be sent to Syria's rebuilding until a political agreement between Assad and opposition was accepted in order to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say that a recent time agreement between Russia and Turkey for the establishment of a buffer zone in Idlib, the last great rebel outpost, created an opportunity for progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a broad-scale assault by Syrian forces in support of the Russians on the province, in which three million people live.
However, it was emphasized that the agreement had ‘obvious end' and expressed hope that the military action would focus on the jihad fighters, including fighters from the victory front associated with the al-Qaeda organization, which would be "destroyed".
UN envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes to soon convene first meetings of a new committee, which will be composed of members of government and opposition, to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
His employer set conditions for the participation of the Syrian government on the committee and said that panel work should be limited “to the examination of the clauses of the current constitution, ” and warned against intervention.
Why would Trump win a second term?
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers hope, impeachment and scandal will end his presidency before its time.
When there is no doubt the most dramatic finale in presidential history of all time!
Right now, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, ratings in peak times have increased by over doubles and reached 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled themselves to 1.6 million viewers on MSNBC.
The average of Fox News stands at 2.4 million viewers in peak hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the "Rachel Meadow Show" broadcast on MSNBC, reached the top of the cable ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers on important news nights.
“ It is the fire that people are attracted to because it is not something that we understand," said Neil Barr, executive producer of the ABC drama series The Designated Survivor, who engages in a Secretary of State who becomes president after an attack destroys the capital.
Nell Scoble, an old comedy writer and writer "Only the funny parts: ...and some hard truths about infiltrating into the Hollywood men's circle" have another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
She asked.
“ He said, “Because he makes me laugh, ” said Mrs.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike all other television programs, the plot lines coming out of Washington may determine the future of the ruling "Rue vs. Wade", whether immigrant families can be reunited again and the health of the world’s economy.
Changing a channel or ignoring is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you exceed the bounds of being an educated citizen when you find yourselves watching six hours of the President's work done in "secret informants" as the source of the book Fear, Zhectt Humpist at the end of the 20th century.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“ Part of what he does, which feels similar to that of a reality show, is that he feeds you something every night," said Brett Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show "History for Sale", about the alternate team at the Daily Show in the plot (the war with the NFL, praises Kim Gyeong-on).
You can't afford to lose one episode or stay behind.
When I got to Mr. Place this week, it was clear outside with a temperature of about 26 degrees on the north coast of Kaoai Island, but he closed down to watch MSNBC, recording the CNN parallel.
He was unable to disengage, not when Brett Cavanaugh prepared to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.
“ I remember the times when we did all these crazy shows in the past and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Place told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Funds from outside sources flood the race into Congress' closest mid-term elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district faces a flood of funds, thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts, which resulted in the race of two congressmen on the same seat.
The district, Pittsburgh's suburb whose borders have recently been re-drawn, has placed Democratic representative Connor Lamb—who won his seat in another county, in a special election last spring.
Lamb runs against another congressman, Republican Keith : Ruth ‘Puss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, who overlaps heavily with the new 17th District boundaries.
The maps were re-drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the division of the previous districts had been discriminated against, and against the Constitution, the results in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a financial blowout battle in the campaign between the financial weapons of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Commission (DCC) and the Republican Campaign Committee (NRC).
Lamb became a recognized name in Pennsylvania after a close win in the March Special Election, which was widely watched, for the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The seat belonged to Republicans for over a decade, and President Trump won the county by a 20-point margin.
Political commentators predicted a slight advantage for Democrats.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for support in China, and subsequently withdrew
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with slight opposition from Washington.
Trump had a hot meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varella, in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump management team.
Foreign Ministry officials decided to return the heads of the American diplomatic expeditions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in response to "the final decisions not to recognize Taiwan", said Heather Navart, the office spokeswoman, in a statement at the beginning of the month.
But the levy of penalties was only considered against El Salvador, which was estimated to have received $140 million assistance from the United States in 2017, which included drug control, development, and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included economic aid cuts and targeted restrictions on admission visas, could have hurt the country from Central America suffering from unemployment rates and high murder rates.
At the time of the advances of internal meetings, officials from North and Central America rejected an emergency conference that was to focus on safety and economic prosperity as continuing to a similar conference last year which was perceived as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from reaching the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials made their desire for the promotion of the conference clear, ending with all penalties against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference participants, currently scheduled for mid-October, as a symbol of the importance the administration attributed to him, said the diplomats.
And three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new messages or hard sentences from Washington.
A White House spokesman on Bolton's behalf refused to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal discussions, provided they remain anonymous.
Their explanations were corroborated by an external analyst, close to the administration, who also spoke anonymously.
Studying History
The next obvious thing may come from the report of Special Counsel Robert Muller for obstructing Trump's alleged investigations, which now have significant evidence in the public records.
Muller points out his investigation, reportedly, to whether Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in its attacks on our campaign.
If congressional control changes, Trump will find himself accountable to this body, just as soon as he prepares to face the voters again, and possibly a jury.
There are a lot of questions here that begin with "if" and I'm not going to argue that Trump's downfall is inevitable—not even of his counterparts in Europe.
On either side of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect the duration of the struggle that may take.
In 1938, German officers would have been willing to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West had opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to prevent the years of carnage that occurred as a result.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the march of unstoppable democracy, accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing several such turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly record the president and speculated about his inadequacy to the presidency.
Rosenstein said the Times report is inaccurate.
“ How will we respond if the F.B.I. investigation into the newly requested Brett Cavanaugh case is not full or fair — or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term election and appoint a Congress to hold Trump responsible?
If we fail these tests, democracy will fall into a long winter nap.
But I believe we won't fail, because of the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime who had also previously conquered the glorious home I had.
She survived, immigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light Saturday candles on the same table bearing the swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Durance of the Range - Optimizing for the conflict at Rapid Vienna
The Rangers host Rapid Vienna on the day of the ‘day', and know that winning the Austrians, after the impressive draw against Viarial in Spain earlier this month, will place them in a strong position to qualify from Group G in the European League.
A knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Durance from appearing for the first time in the season until a 2–2 draw with Viriel, but he believes the Rangers could use this result as a jumpboard for better performance.
“ It was a good point for us because Viriel is a good group, ” said the 31 - year - old footballer.
We went out into the game believing we could accomplish something and score a point.
We might have won at the end, but, all in all, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out of stasis in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday's gonna be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it's gonna be a tough game because they got a good score on their last game, but with the audience behind us, I'm convinced we can push and get a positive result.
This past year has been really hard, with everything that's happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but there's a good feeling about the place right now.
The team is good and the guys are really enjoying it; the training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, put the last season behind and succeed.
Women stay awake because of that fear of pension savings.
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea as to how they wanted to be treated, only a few people talk about it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the National Survey said they were talking to their partners about the cost of long-term nursing care.
Only 10% said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take steps to have the conversation," said Holly Schneider, vice president of the National Life Insurance Society.
We can do it the next way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare the family to provide care if you do not express your wishes long before the time is right.
Use your advisor and family to discuss where and how to be treated, as these choices may be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Share it with your financial advisor: the counselor can also help you find a way to pay for the expenses.
Your funding options for long-term nursing care may include a long-term traditional insurance policy, a hybrid policy for life insurance with a sum of money to help cover expenses, or self-insurance with your capital—as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal papers: find an early solution to legal struggles on this occasion.
Find and appoint a health care force, a reliable person to oversee your medical care and make sure that the professionals fulfill your wishes in case you can't communicate.
Consider also signing power of attorney when it comes to your finances.
Choose a reliable person to make financial decisions in your place and ensure payment of bills if you are unfit.
Don't forget the little details: imagine that your adult parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer any questions about medication or allergies?
Mention these details in a written program to be prepared.
“ The financial side is not the only important point, but also who are the doctors? ” Martin asked.
“ What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare the program".

Palin is being held in custody at the Matt-Soo Pretriel facility under a $500 self-cost, according to a report of the KTU TV channel.
According to network reports, he appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, for sure", when asked to make his case.
Palin was accused of three Class A conduct offences, and may therefore, be jailed for a year and fined for $250,000.
He was also accused of a B-class conduct offence, which could be imposed a day sentence in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently in front of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing the report of a domestic violence crime, and possession of weapons under drunkenness in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he punched her in the face.
Groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to posttraumatic stress disorder stemming from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami wave and earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds were killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that hit Indonesian island Sulawesi by day and ‘.
The earthquake, at a magnitude of 7.5, caused a tsunami wave and destroyed thousands of homes.
The power and communication grids have been cut off and the loss rate is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck close to the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, G.K.A.

Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate at a beach festival in Palo City when the tsunami wave shattered on the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek a rare death penalty to suspect a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York seek the death penalty for Scipiovan, the suspect in the New York City terrorist bombing who killed eight people—a rare punishment that has not been carried out for federal crime in the country since 1953.
A 30-year-old Safeov used the claim of a rental truck of Home Depot to carry out a bike track bombing at the side of the West Side Highway in southern Manhattan, and a pedestrian and cyclist who got on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Sifov had initially killed the eight victims and had "intendedly" caused serious injuries to the body, according to the statement of intentions for the death penalty request, submitted in the Southern borough of New York.
According to the court's document, the death penalty can be demanded on these two counts.
Weeks after the bombing, a federal jury slapped Sifov with an indictment that included 22 counts, including eight counts of extortion-assisted murder, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and charged with violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The bombing required “a significant premeditation and intent, ” said the prosecutors, describing the way Seifov carried out the bombing as "a low, brutal, and sickly one".
"Sypholov caused damage, damage, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Anglicans, Ann-Lure Drake, Hernán Prodigali, Hernán Pramese, Hernándo Nacionalo Nagoku", written in the statement of intents.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the Southern District of New York sued for capital punishment in a case occurred a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after their conviction of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union two years before.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair, on 19 June 1953.
According to court documents, Sifov, a native of Uzbekistan, expressed no remorse in the days and months after the bombing.
He stated to the investigators that he felt good about his actions, said police.
Saifov told authorities that he had been inspired by the bombing after watching videos of Dhash on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to police, he also sought to hang a flag of dhash in the hospital room where he was staying.
He claimed he was innocent in response to the 22-count indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal defense attorneys representing Sifov, said that they were "disappointed of course" by the prosecution’s decision.
“ We think the decision to seek the death penalty rather than to accept an admission of guilt that would lead to life imprisonment without the possibility of release, only to date the trauma of these events over all involved," Patton said.
Saifov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Prague should be appointed in charge of negotiations for Braxit.
"Nigel Prague : Vow to enlist the People's Army » Today during protest at Conservatives' Conference".
The former leader of the UKIP party said politicians must whisper pressure ‘from the Europeans - when a Member of Parliament from the Conservative Party of Theresa May claimed to be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Boone said on the march in Birmingham that Britain → would already be out → by this time if Prague → had been served as Secretary of Breczit.
But the challenge facing him stands May, reconciliation of the very divided ranks of the Conservatives, was highlighted by the joining of Conservatives supporting the remaining of the European Union for a different demonstration against the city's barracese.
The Prime Minister struggles for leaving her settlement plan, the Ch.Cress, on its way despite attacks by Brekzeit supporters, supporters of the stay and from the EU.
The Allies insisted that she continue to try and achieve an agreement with Brussels despite counter-reactions—and force the aeroscaptist and Labour Party to choose between her agreement and ‘Chaos,'.
Boone said at a meeting of the Leive Means Live Group in Solehall that he wanted Çä to break up with the Hooks.
He claimed Prague had to be accepted as a friend and to be in charge of negotiations with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we'd be out by now", he said.
Member of Parliament from Wallingborough added: › I will defend the Brexit but we have to say good-bye to the Hooks.
He emphasized his opposition to the European Union and said: › We did not fight in both world wars to be enslaved.
We want to make our own rules in our own country".
Mr. Boone dismissed the claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: › The idea that the British people had changed their mind and wanted to remain is entirely false ‘.
Conservative MP and supporter of the Andrea G. Jenkins was also on the march and told reporters: › I say simply: The Prime Minister, listen to the people.
› The Cress program is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular among our party and among our activists who took to the streets and chose us in the first place.
"Please abandon the hook and start listening."
In a critical message aimed at May, she added: › Prime Ministers keep their job when they keep their promises.
Prague ‘ said at the convention, politicians should be made to feel the pressure ‘if they are going to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
It is now a question of trust that we have, the people, and our political status," he said.
They're trying to betray Braxit and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to let you get away with it.
He added, in a message to the enthusiastic audience: I want you to make our political status, which is about to betray Braxit, feel pressured.
We call this country's People's Army, which has given us the victory in Braxit and will never rest until we become Britain independent, self-governmental, and proud ‘.
At that moment, the remaining supporters marched in Birmingham and then held a two-hour conference downtown.
A handful of activists waved Conservative announcements against Breczit" after the group was formed over the weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis mocked the opening of the Conservative Conference on the security issues from which they suffered with the party app.
› These are people who tell us they can have IT systems and all possible technology for the existence of an agreement such as Canada Plus Plus, for border crossing without friction and free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
That's totally ridiculous.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he added.

Grand Prix Russia: Lewis Hamilton ends with a world title after team rankings awarded him a victory over Sebastian Vettle
It was clear, from the moment Waltery Botas qualified to the next level before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, that Mercedes team rankings would play an important role in the race.
From the first moment Botas had a good start and he left Hamilton almost alone as he defended his place in the first two rounds and invited Wettel to attack his teammate.
Wattle went out for the intermediate stop first and let Hamilton fit into the movement in the competition's tail, a crucial decision apparently.
Mercedes team went out for a intermediate stop later and returned to the race behind Wettel, but Hamilton moved forward after a tight wheel fight that ended up the Ferrari driver had to leave the inner route to hold off without risk after a double move in the third corner.
Max Verstafen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back row of the ranking and was seventh at the end of the first round.
He then led for a large part of the race and did not change tires to achieve a quick finish and bypass Kimi Reyconen for fourth place.
He eventually dropped to a intermediate stop in the 44th round and failed to step up the pace in the remaining eight innings when Raynon took fourth place.
It's a tough day because Waltery did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me get around it.
The team did extraordinary work to reach the Double," Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at the conference on Saturday, in reference to her insistence on not leaking a letter from Christine Blaise Ford, accusing Brett Cavanaugh of the Supreme Court nominee, of sexual assault.
While speaking at a conference in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and instead said that the occurrence of the Senate shows that people are "bad and despicable and liars".
“ The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see angry and mean people and liars, ” he said.
“ When you look at the publications and the pages, they say, “Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
So, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak," he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford detailing the charges against Cavanaugh in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“ I did not hide Dr. Ford's charges, I did not leak her story," Feinstein said to the committee, according to the newspaper The Hill.
“ She asked me to keep his secret, and I kept the letter as secret as she asked me to.
But the senator’s denial did not appear to have been accepted by the president, who responded to it during the conference on Saturday evening: “I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe it's not [the leak], but it's the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, and claimed Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
“ They are determined to return to power at all costs.
You see the convictions, the despicable, they don't care who they hurt, who they run over on the way to power and power," said the President, according to a report of Mediaite.

A plane crashed in Micronesia: Air New Guinea says one person was missing after a plane crash in Laguna
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says that one person is missing, having previously stated that all 47 passengers and crew personnel were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air New Guinea said in a message beginning in the afternoon on Saturday, she was unable to say what had become of one passenger.
The airline said it works together with authorities, hospitals and local investigators to try and find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or citizenship.
Local boats helped rescue the passengers and other crew after the aircraft hit the water, while attempting to land at the Tschick Island Airport.
Officials said on day and day that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained on Saturday at the hospital and that the condition of all remaining is stable.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the aircraft landed in Laguna a short distance from the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
American passenger Bill G. Gaines said the plane had reached a very low orbit.
"That's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others were able to make their way to the emergency exits in the waist-high water on the sinking plane.
He said the plane crew panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby on dock improvement, also helped with rescue operations, using an inflatable boat that brought people ashore before the aircraft sank in water that placed about 30 metres (100 ft).

Analyst details the course of events the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution proved its case on Saturday, in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman while alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Revolt of the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the defendant's movements, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the movements of the victim, 19-year-old Jessica C. Chambers, on the night she was murdered.
According to the Clarion Report to the Ledger, Revolt said he received the location data from several cell phones that showed Tallis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his earlier claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with that of Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went out to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had spoken the truth when he said he was with Sanford that night, Sanford said he had "lied, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was that Tillis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicated they only knew each other for a week.
Revolt said that some time after Chambers' death, Tallis erased the text messages, calls, and contact details of Chambers from his phone.
“ He erased her from his life, ” Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing speech on Sunday, according to planning.
The judge said he expects the trial to be transferred to jury litigation later that day.

Another black man?!
New York City nanny sues a couple for firing after text message "racist"
A therapist from New York is suing a couple for discrimination after receiving a text message that was not intended for her from the mother who complained that the therapist was “another black person. ”
The couple denied being racist and compared the lawsuit to blackmail.
Linsey Flasco-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she found out that her new childcare therapist, G. Hazel Morris, was black when she arrived on the first day of work in 2016.
"Noooo Another Black Man", Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
According to a report by the New York Post, after paying attention to the mouth emissions, Plasco-Falzman fired Mrs. ‘Morris, and said that the former therapist, who was of African-American descent, did a poor job, and that she now expected to hire Filipino instead.
Ms. ? Morris was paid for one day's work and sent to her home with Uber.
Now, Morris sues the couple for firing, and asks for a $350-a-day compensation for six months of work and living in a place for which she was originally hired, though without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do things like that," she told the Post on the day and said, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple fought back on the claims that they were racists, saying that Maurice's termination of employment was requested, out of fear that they could not trust her after she was hit.
“ My wife sent her something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," said her husband Joel Flasco to the post.
But would you put your child in the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was an accident?
Your soft baby?
Come on."
Flasco compared the lawsuit to blackmail and said that his wife was only due two months before the event and was “in a very serious situation.
“ Do you want to pursue someone like her?
Not nice to do such a thing," added the investment banker.
The legal case is still in progress, but the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, eliminating their behavior and arguments used.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Gjnkel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It is hard to imagine yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very amusing to know now what we know about Paddington's enormous success."
After saying that her father, who worked at BBC as a photographer before being inspired to write the children's book from a small toy bear, would become bloodthirsty about his rejection of work, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "merry-sweet", after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of his success, eventually, of Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of our family".
“ He was a quiet man, not an arrogant man, ” she said.
“ But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who accomplished something: you are proud of him even though it is not really you.
I think he saw Paddington's success about that.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always said it was because of Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say hi to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Ned called fluently saying that she was in really bad shape, that she wasn't expected to last." Mrs. Adenan-Lafros said.
“ Then I got a call from Ned saying that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I needed to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating slowly disappeared and exited her system.
She died sometime before, and it's over. It all stopped.
All I could do was sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't whine or scream or cry because I was surrounded right now by families and people.
I had to really hold on."
In the end, Mrs. ‘Ednan-Lafros, in mourning now for the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane alongside other passengers, unaware of the last ordeal journey.
No one knew," she said.
My head was bent, and tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had a stunning sense of sympathy with Ned.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women mourn openly on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries hung postcards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to which people could call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don't want any other parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Davis, the 45-year-old, who lived in Leidney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“ Everyone recognized him for his smile.
They always said his smile lit up every room."
But he stopped working before he died, for he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I'm constantly afraid of a chain reaction."
Ms. • Davis created the postcards, “so that people would know that there was someone to talk to, even if it was a friend.
Don't sit still - you need to talk".
Ms. ‘Hampries, Mrs. Davis' friend for years, has lost Mark, a life partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“ He did not say that he was feeling depressed or depressed or anything else, ” she said.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was at rock bottom on Christmas Day – when the kids opened the presents he didn't make eye contact with them or anything."
She said that his death was a huge trauma to them, but that they overcame it: “It creates a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must all continue to fight."

Brett Cavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI begins his investigation.
“ I thought, if we could really get what he asked for — a timely and limited investigation — perhaps we could bring a little to the union, ” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee had been ‘ torn apart ’ in the authorized party's impasse.
Why were Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters not interested in the FBI investigation?
Their deterrence comes entirely from timing.
The mid-term elections will be held just five more weeks, on November 6th, and if, as expected, Republicans do not succeed in them, they will be greatly weakened in their attempts to bring the choice of the man they want to the highest court in the country.
George ‘W' Bush picked up the phone and called the senators to lobby them to support Cavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met him through his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI gets his report out?
There will be a vote in the Senate, in which 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently in office.
It is not yet clear whether Cavanaugh will be able to receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, to allow Vice President Mike Pence, to break the tie and approve his appointment to the Supreme Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea › Download → Under Kim
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea, has declined since Kim G. Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean lawman.
Park Byung-sig, quoted data from the South Korean Union Office saying the number of defections last year was 1,127, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the key factors for this were the stricter boundary criticism between North Korea and China and the increase in the sums charged by the people's smugglers.
Pyongyang did not make a public statement.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the conclusion of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, with which North Korea has the longest border and which is easier to cross compared to the military territory (DMZ) which is well-guarded between the two states of Korea.
China refers to deserters as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
The relations between the North and the South—which are technically still at war—have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier in the new, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the stuck negotiations on nuclear disarmament issues.
The meeting took place after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim G. Jhong-un in Singapore, in which the two generally agreed to act towards an era in which the Korean Peninsula would not hold nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has blamed the sanctions the United States has imposed for the lack of progress since then.
“ Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally dismantle our weapons first," Ree said in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh "historic" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Commons, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate “historic ” and said that his character did not allow him to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi responded in an interview on Saturday, at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever shown up like this, they would have said Çhistri", Pelosi said about her comment on Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the day of the ‘.
Cavanaugh emotionally rejected the allegations that sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Cavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes almost shouted and choked when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee and called for arguments against him “a coordinated and grotesque character murder ” organized because of the Liberals’ anger over Hillary Clinton losing the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she thought Cavanaugh's testimony proved unable to serve in the Supreme Court because it showed prejudice against the Democrats.
“ I think he dismissed himself with these statements and the way he pursued the Clintons and Democrats, ” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked whether you would try to depose Cavanaugh if his appointment was approved, and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House.
“ I will say this — if he is not telling the truth to Congress or to the FBI then he is not fit, not only for the Supreme Court term, but also to the court where he is currently in office," said Pelosi.
Cavanaugh currently serves as a judge in the District of Columbia Federal Appeals Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she has concerns about possible rulings by Cavanaugh against Obama's health reform or judgment against Wade ·, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh evaded questions regarding the possibility of repealing certain Supreme Court decisions.
“ There is no reason for a hysterical, biased person to come to court and expect it to be said, “Isn’t it wonderful, ” Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
It is a keen criticism, months and years of rage overflows, and she cannot express them without crying.
“ We cry when we get angry, ” said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, do you?"
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager elsewhere, who said that she too cried when she got upset, but she developed a technique and every time she got angry and started crying, she used to say to a person she spoke to,“ You may think that I am sad because I am crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are given as an outlet for rage, among other things because they are not fundamentally understood.
One of my most significant memories of a position early in my life, in an office with a majority of men, is that I once found myself crying in unexpressed rage, and an older woman grabbed my neck, it was a cool manager from which I was always a little scared—and dragged me into the stairwell.
“ Don’t ever let them see you cry, ” she told me.
“ They do not know that you are furious.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they managed to get you down."
Patricia Schroeder, who was at the time a Colorado congresswoman, worked with Gary Hart during the campaigns he ran for president.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business and exited the race, Schroeder, who was deeply frustrated, realized there was no reason why she would not consider the idea of running for president herself.
“ It was not a decision that I thought well of, ” she told me 30 years later and laughed.
“ There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another contestant.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because she joined the campaign late, she was behind in fundraising, so she swore she would not join the race unless you raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"They think I'm getting a discount"?
At the time of the speech in which she announced that she would not launch an official campaign, the emotions overwhelmed her so much – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration from the system that made it so difficult to raise money and focus on voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexual discrimination – she choked with tears.
“ You'd think I had a nervous breakdown, ” recalls Schroeder in the way the press responded to her.
“ You would think that I was sponsored by McClinx.
I remember thinking, what would they say about my tombstone?
"She cried"?
How the U.S.-China trade war might benefit Beijing
The opening barrages of the U.S. and China trade war were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a rift between the countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the opening shot earlier this year when taxing important export products of China including solar, steel and aluminum receptors.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new rates affecting $200 billion worth of products (150 million pounds), in actually taxing half of the goods imported to the US from China.
Beijing responded each time in the same coin, and recently raised rates by five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to return a blow to every US strike, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will surrender in the near future.
A request from Washington to retract means surrender to its demands, but a public bow to the United States would be too embarrassing for the President of China, Shi Jjing.
Experts, however, say that if Beijing manages to handle things correctly, the pressures from the trade war with the United States may positively support China in the long run, reducing the mutual dependence between the two economies.
“ The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of economic spin in any of the countries is in fact far more dangerous than previously observed," said Abigail Grace, a research partner who focuses on Asia, on the New American Security think tank.
"Syria is ready for the return of refugees," says the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance to rebuild the country that has been destroyed in a long war that has lasted over seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mullem said the conditions in the country are improving.
“ The situation in a more stable and secure territory is now due to progress in the war on terror, ” he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to restore the situation to normal.
All conditions now exist for the return of refugees of their own free will to the country they left because of the terror and unilateral economic measures, aimed to damage their daily lives and livelihood.
According to UN estimates, over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million other people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Umem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the ruined country.
But he stressed that the regime would not receive conditional assistance or assistance from countries that funded the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The 2018 European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated the U.S. national team with a final score of 16.5–10.5 on La Golf National out of Paris, France.
The U.S. has so far lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe once again won the crown as the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points it took her to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Michaelson, who struggled throughout the entire tournament almost, sent his swing from a tee stake to the water at the 16th hole of Par-3, losing the game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari polished in all of his rounds, becoming one of the four players to reach 5-0-0 since the start of the tournament in the current formation, in 1979.
American actor Järden Sepith" was defeated 5 and 4 by the lowest ranking player on the European team, Thérvjörn Olsen of Denmark.
Dustin G. Johnson, the world's first ranked player, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Folter of England, who may be the last time to play in the Ryder Cup.
With a seniority of eight participants in the Ryder Cup, Spanish Sergejiyo Garcia became the European player with the highest number of tournament wins with 25.5 career points.
“ I don’t usually cry, but now I can’t help it.
It's been a rough year.
So I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have the trophy back.
This is about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said Garcia emotionally after the European victory.
He delivers the torch to his son John Ram who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in the only game on Sunday.
“ The tremendous pride I feel, defeating Tiger Woods, in which I watched as I grew up, ” said 23 - year - old Ram.
Woods lost all four games in France and his record now stands at 13–21–3, as a Ryder Cup pitcher in his career.
It is strange statistics from one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 important titles, with only J.K. Niklaus in front of him.
The U.S. national team struggled all weekend to find its way through the lawns, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Pineau who played high-level golf throughout the entire tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Fyrick spoke after his staff's disappointing performance, “I am proud of these boys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We failed.
Good for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American Professional Golf Association and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
Gotta take your hat off.
We've been defeated."
