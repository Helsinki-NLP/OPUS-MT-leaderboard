Fire deleted in French chemical plant
The large burn in a chemical plant in the northern French town of Rouen was wiped out. This announced the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire was broken on Thursday night. No one was injured in the incident. The firefighter was in use with about 200 dropping vehicles.
Fire could be stopped.
Anrainers were called to not leave their houses. Buildings were evacuated within 500 meters, schools and gardens remained closed on Thursday. Chemicals manufactured on the shores of the Seine. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billion Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive.
About 400 people work in the factory. In the past, the chemical factory provided headlines - for example, when in 2013, by a leak, the gas methanthiol escaped and the surroundings widely rocked by lazy eggs. In 2015, after an operational accident, around 2,000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city’s wastewater system.
Woman announces her job to look for her disappeared dog 57 days
For two months, a woman from Washington looked for her disappeared dog - and announced extra for her job. Seven-year-old Border Collie was left out of the hotel room during a short holiday in Montana. 57 days, the dog missed every trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got bad," Carole King told Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left Hundin Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie was disappeared. They were looking for the beast, but without success.
Donner has painked dogs
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, 'She's traveled about four, four and a half hours ago'," recalls Carole King to Daily Inter Lake. When the automatic door opened, Katie immediately came out.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But from days were weeks. "I have never abandoned. I have never lost hope," Carole King told Daily Inter Lake, who announced their job as postal employees to continue their search for Katie.
"The tears flow"
57 days after Katie disappeared, Carole King received a call: A man reported and said that Katie was found in her courtyard. But when King arrived there, Katie was already disappeared. She was looking for the neighborhood and suddenly her puppy was thinking that she had holded under a tree.
Losses at the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without trace
Friday, September 27, 2019
Six machine guns of type MG3 are still disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of fire ammunition, including three machine guns. The remains is unclear in most cases. The opposition is talking about a "fearful" extent.
At the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition are repeatedly disappearing - many of them so far untracedly. Since the beginning of 2014, the troops have lost 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and almost 20,000 fire ammunition. This results in a closure-classified list of the Federal Defence Ministry, reported by the editorial network Germany.
According to the paper from the Defence Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one part and 3474 shooting ammunition have been reappeared until now, including six machine guns of type MG3, eleven guns of type G3, four guns of type G36, six signal guns of type Pro8 and two guns of type G3.
The scope of weapons and ammunition losses at the Bundeswehr is "shocking," said Martina Renner, left-stage member of the Bundeswehr. This was more, since the result of the investigation had hardly been found a convicted wound of the race.
Oil tank "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tank "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas today on Friday. As Refinitiv's ship observation data showed, the tank moved and left the Iranian port. As a target port, Port Rashid was indicated in the United Arab Emirates.
The tank was actually released by the Iranian government on Monday, but initially it remained in Iranian waters.
The Stena Impero was accused on July 19 by the Iranian revolutionary gardens in the Hormuz Sea Road to violate security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran responded to the controversial, temporary establishment of an Iranian oil tank before Gibraltar belonging to the UK.
The Hormuz Road is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil exports are shipped by the sea. The tensions in the region had been enormously exacerbated in the past months. The commercial shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the USA and Iran.
Merkel honors the courage of people in the peaceful revolution
Chancellor Angela Merkel has recognized the commitment of the people in the GDR who went on the street 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In autumn 1989, courageous citizens would have broken the GDR regime at the time, Merkel said in a festivity of the Thuringian CDU.
Musk seeks extradition record
Tesla’s quarter may keep record ready, and despite the boom of delivery, there were last losses in the electric car company.
New York.Tesla chief Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the exchange with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail published by the industry blog "Electrek" to Tesla employees.
The demand was strong, so Tesla could make 110000 orders, said Musk’s newsletter, the challenge is to bring the cars to the customer quickly, and Tesla needs to offer as many resources as possible to the quarter end.
Investors liked that: Tesla’s shares were traded with more than 6%. So strongly the price has no longer increased for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered about 95,000 cars, thus achieving its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high targets. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, in the current and coming quarter of the year, six digits need to be made. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is demanded, but here are low winning margins. Despite the boom there were last losses.
Resolved puzzles: That's why we can't kitzel ourselves
A kind of brake in the big brain prevents people from kitting themselves. This found scientists from the Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday night, progress has also been made in the question why children are so strongly opposed to the kitting, only to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why the approximation of a kitzelling hand only triggers laughter, which lies at a deep layer in the great brain, which triggers the laughter in the expectation of the kitzel.
According to previous research, rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasonic area when they are kicked by people, which is conveyed by the part of the large-brain ridge, which serves to centrally process the haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touch
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can differ between self-touch and self-touch by others, so that people cannot get themselves, but the Berlin researchers now found in the experiments at the rats that laughter as well as the activity of the activity of the large brain have been enhanced by the self-touch in the brain.
However, passing self-touch and touch by others at the same time, laughter is also suppressed. This suggests that the rat's brain cannot distinguish between self-touch and touch by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot kitty themselves because self-touch activate a brake in the great brain.
The rats have also been trained to kitzel themselves, and they break this initiation in the experiment therefore sometimes prematurely, demonstrating escape behavior or scary stars. This ambivalence equal to the behavior of children. The ambivalence of the kitzel is a behavioral reaction that is equal in rats and people.
Removed catastrophe: Large fire deleted in French chemical plant
The large burn in a chemical plant in the northern French town of Rouen, which was particularly dangerous, has been deleted. This announced the Normandy prefecture of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire was broken on Thursday night.
According to the authorities, no health-threatening substances are supposed to have stopped. The samples taken are not anxious, as said Prefect Pierre-André Durand on Friday morning at a press conference. No one was injured in the event, and the firefighter was used with about 200 dropping vehicles.
Schools and gardens were closed
Inhabitants were asked not to leave their houses; buildings were evacuated within 500 meters, schools and gardens remained closed on Thursday.
Factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by US billionaire Warren Buffett
In the chemical plant on the shores of the Seine, additives for lubricants are manufactured. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the EU’s so-called Seveso Directive, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements. The factory works around 400 people.
In the past, the chemical factory provided headlines - for example, when in 2013, by a leak, the gas methanthiol escaped and the surroundings widely rocked to lazy eggs. In 2015, after an operational accident, around 2000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city’s wastewater system.
Brexit: Johnson's own sister's criticism
Boris Johnson's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first meeting in Parliament after the compulsory pause on Wednesday evening, but the Premier threatens to lead the country from the EU on 31 October without agreements should not enter Brussels on his demands for amendments to the Brexit agreement.
About Cox, who had served for Britain’s remaining in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: “The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and re-evering this country would be to take place the EU exit.” Cox was murdered in 2016 during the referendum election struggle by a right-wing extremist.
Reminder of attacks from Oslo and Utoya
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utoya with 77 deaths, a reminder in Norway is revealed on Saturday in honor of the victims. The monument "Jernrose" (German: the iron roses) consists of around 1,000 iron roses. They remember the roses that thousands of people had held in the days and weeks after the attacks before the Dom in Oslo.
The project of artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be revealed at the same place – the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and members of the victims, and Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are expected to open.
On 22 July 2011, legal terrorismist Anders Behring Breivik initially fired a car bomb in Oslo’s government district and afterwards killed dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Worker Party.
Iran releases British tanks
The UN General debate did not bring a solution in the Iran conflict, but there is now a less problem. The British oil tank "Stena Impero" held in Iran could get back into the sea. It could be a puzzle piece in the Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tank "Stena Impero" held in the street of Hormus in Iran since mid-July is back in international waters. After release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on the way to Dubai, as the ferry company Stena Bulk said.
The Stena Impero left the port of Bandar Abbas and now drive the crew to Dubai for medical examinations, Erik Hånell said. At midnight, the ship left the Iranian waters. "Beautifully it's over," he told Swedish television channel SVT.
"This is part of a pattern of attempts to impair the freedom of the seas. We work with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," he said in a statement on Friday.
The Iranian revolutionary gardens had set the tanker on July 19 under the accusation of violating sea law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members had been doing well according to the circumstances, Hånell said.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar: in early July, a super tank with oil from Iran, designed for Syria, was placed on the chain. The delivery was stopped by the authorities against EU sanctions against the country of war against Syria.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released, assumptions that it was a exchange business to get the "Stena Impero" free, London veebly returned.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the world's oil exports are shipped by the sea. The tensions in the region have been enormously exacerbated in recent months. The commercial shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington, the nuclear dispute of both countries stands. The Americans argue the Iranian leadership to wish to build nuclear weapons. Iran refuses that. The US was expanded from the international nuclear agreements in 2018, which should strictly prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb, and at the same time stop its political and economic isolation.
Due to the dispute about the Stena Impero and other incidents with tanks in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the U.S. works on a coalition for military protection of trade vessels in the region.
Iran’s President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for safety and peace at the UN General Assembly in New York, with the initiative “Coalition of Hope” for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protective powers, wants to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined to the "war-profit" in the face of the penalties imposed by President Donald Trump against Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic seem to be forced to redispone to a billions in the worldwide.
However, India itself has now been focused on Trump's focus. Devaluating the "Royal of Tariffs" in the White House, America has removed the threshold in early June the trade advantages for 2000 products. The US prohibit India of high tariffs and demands a better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, and other motors.
On the World Map of Trade Wars, however, the farms with India are merely a side-show. Also, America considers the world’s largest democracy through security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combines concern about China’s power claims in the South Indian Ocean. Therefore, a salve of American penalty duties against India is unlikely to come at a second time.
The problem lies in another place, however: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development, has a serious stand in the socialist Republic of India. It is also under modes. Its reformism seems to aim primarily to take advantage of the bureaucratic transport foolishness, which has been maintained in the many peoples.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. In the first five modes of India, economically, a lot of things have turned to better in the first five modes, but this does not apply in the trade policy. The national conservative government has even built new barriers to protect internationally little competitive companies from foreign suppliers.
In the West, the modes of the nimbus of the energetic reformer, which renews his country economically radically. This impression is not least owed to the circumstance that the charismatic prime minister is only too well knowing which vocabulary and political leaders of their western branches are forced to be the vocabulary of their branches.
Burial of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
Former French President Jacques Chirac is expected to be buried in Paris next week. The former head of state will be buried Monday at the Montparnasse Cemetery in the south of the French capital, reported the news agency AFP as reported to the Chiracs family. The burial will be held in the close family circle in Paris.
Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Cup of Athletics
In the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba was not hazardous to switch around the Armenschweig. As a sudden half of the Armenschweig. As a sudden half of the Armenschweig. As a sudden half of the Armenschweig. As a sudden half of the Armenschweig.
"I just wanted to help him. Everybody in this situation would have done the same," Dabo said after the race in Mixed Zone, when he was completely unexpected to draw the attention of the gathered journalists, he was only gone away, he wouldn't have been invited to talk about my heroism at all.
He did that on the evening, and much more intensely than he probably thought, because this heroic statement will remain remembered. Zumal Dabo even left his competitor Busby in the target and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, five minutes after the Ethiopian Busle, Selemon Barega, who won this target, was came from the end of the world.
Dabo, who lived in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, started to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha, which, according to official data, was disappointed at 18:10.87 minutes, "I wanted to walk 17:55 minutes. I was once under 18 minutes."
Millions: Egyptians are preparing for wild protest day
In Egypt, safety measures have been strengthened in advance of possible governmental critical protests. In the centre of Cairo, a stronger police presence was observed on Friday. Several metro stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir square were locked.
In recent days, the police had strengthened their street controls and the phones of pedestrians were partly searching for news and photos related to the protests, and hundreds were arrested, according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend it came to protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. They focused against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic for corruption and misunderstanding. The most criticism of the country today. A so open protest against the political leadership had not been made in Egypt for years.
The number of arrests related to the protests continued to increase two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people have been "arbitrarily arrested" only because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time," said HRW in appeal of lawyers. The charges against the detainees range from "distribution of false information" to membership in a "terrorism association" in Cairo, in Alexandria and in other cities.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country, thus blocking the government in Cairo websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online Dealers: Shipping Dealers Can Donate Returns Easier
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods, so about 20 million returns land on the garbage, but there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies could not be freed from sales tax on donations, the Ministry declared on a matter of the Green Bundesday fraction, which reported the newspapers of the Funke Media Group on Friday, but the traders could apply the market value of unsale returns so low that they need to pay no or only little sales tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that the federal citizens returned every sixth package on the Internet, and about four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - landed in the waste. They would cost the companies more money, as the financial authorities evaluate sales donations such as a revenue on the revenue tax.
Katrin Göring-Eckardt urged Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with an agreement that companies cannot rate selling products accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organizations. Companies should rely on the market to not be punished for donations, but also to be punished for fashion.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
Streetart-Star Banksy's well-known work, "Devolved Parliament", is to be auctioned soon.
Banksy's work underlines the "reforming of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic housing characterized by animals and tribes". From Saturday, the painting will be issued at Sotheby's in the UK capital until it is to be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated at 1.5 to 2 million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in southwest Britain where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had re-exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. At this occasion, the work, previously called "Frage Hour", was renamed "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parlife").
The image could change the owner for a million.
Lastly, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had delivered a hard blow exchange with the opposition on Wednesday at the first meeting of the Under-House after a forced pause imposed by Johnson by the Upper Court. Johnson wants to take the Brexit already twice displaced on 31 October, if necessary, even without agreement with the EU.
It’s not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, blends into the Brexit debate. In Dover, in southeastern England, he painted a picture that represents a man that breaks a star of the European flag. The work watches thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day when they enter the UK.
Brexit debate is like a “walk in the park”
The heavy verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, in comparison to the 2016 election campaign before the Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a "walk in the park," said Dominic Cummings on Friday in a booking.
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament in recent days and accused them, among other things, of "betrayal" to the people, accusations that he could threaten MPs because they could become a target of death threats, he declined as "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to rest is if the members would finally respect the British decision to exit the EU, and it is not surprising that people were bothered that Britain has not yet exit the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood on Friday, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for retention. "We should talk with respect to each other," he said in a statement. "And we should listen too."
Pakistan’s Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan once again urged the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at his first appearance before the United Nations General Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India probably, Khan said on Friday at the UN General debate in New York. "If it goes poorly, you hope to be prepared for the best, but be prepared for the worst."
India and Pakistan have led three wars since their independence of British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each dominate a part of Kashmir, another part belonging to China. In early August, India had removed the state of autonomy of the Indian Kashmir region, thereby increasing tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
Demonstrators in Cairo call for the fall of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government reacts against the current protests in Egypt with a harsh hand. It shoots the population with a sharp ammunition, more than 2000 detained in prisons, among the 60,000 political prisoners who are already in prisons. Protests in Egypt was never hazardous. But since the power of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is taking all of the state in 2013.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, perspectivelessness and the feeling of being sucked by their own government drove millions to the streets. And that is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi doesn't manage no matter how hard it happens against opponents. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, each third market in Egypt lives under the poverty limit. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is about 10 percent. Those who want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who they have financed: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military's old.
Tüv tests in the Terminal: BER-Head: No "Showstoppers" more for capital airports
Two months have been checked whether the complicated installation mixture works in the interaction with the BER-brand protection. The operators are satisfied with the course, but the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale Tüv tests at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year, safe, Chief Supervisory Board Rainer Bretschneider said after a meeting of the Control Board.
Chief airport Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed examination, but also said that there are still shortcomings in the terminal. "We have many detail topics, but we don't have a real showstopper." He assured that the schedule until the launch still contains buffers.
However, there are evidence that the time reserve would no longer be too large, and the construction planning announcement will now be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, which was intended for the beginning of the year for this autumn.
Hundreds of deficiencies in electricity cables are still to be fixed, and the Tüv wants to examine them until February. "In order to create the requirements for the start of the flight operation, it has to continue to work intensively on the processing of deficiencies," the statement said in a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases there is a lack of evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all the dubles on which the cable roads hang. The airport chief expects that this will be available until the end of the year.
Furthermore, the fire protection at the transition to the railway station under the terminal has not yet worked satisfactory. The problems had led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke screws that can be shut down in a fire like a canvas so that the smoke doesn't spread. They're going too far down. 36 engines have to be replaced.
Fire protection problems and other tree deficiencies and planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it should go into operation in 2011. The costs have increased from two billion since the beginning of 2006 to approximately €6.5 billion for opening next year.
Because the numbers of passengers in Berlin have increased significantly since then, the responsible are planning the expansion of the airport, which is why it should be held at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on October 18, as the Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Financial chief Heike Fölster is shifting to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, personal chief Manfred Bobke von Camen is retiring next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put the airport finances on solid feet.
Chemnitz: Automates for Drugs Exploded - Police Captures Man
He needed money for drugs - and hunted some machines in the Chemnitz city area for that! Now the perpetrator finally sits in prison!
Over the past two years, the number of exploded cigarettes and parking tickets in Chemnitz and the region has increased significantly.
After two detonations at the end of May, the police seized a 33-year-old German at the citizen road and Further road in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: “In the investigation of explosions in act unit with particularly heavy theft led by the Chemnitz criminal police, this suspicion against the 33-year-old was not only confirmed.”
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now made a total of eight actions.
The police spokesman: "With the prey he has apparently financed his anesthetic addiction." Only four times the bomber had exploded parking machines on the citizen road between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The total damage resulted is at least 60,000 euros!
The machine bomber is now in detention, and the police investigation goes on against him.
He was also responsible for further machine explosions in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
In the midst of the price fight with cheap flights such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa daughter AUA "acquires the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna," a press spokesman of Austrian Airlines to APA has confirmed on Friday.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa Billigflyer Eurowings is de facto dissolved. Of the current seven Eurowings aircraft remain four in Vienna. The AUA takes over from January 2020 on the "Wetlease" route, which includes Germany's Eurowings-personal. In Salzburg, three Eurowings jets will be stationed to Salzburg and Eurobruck Inn.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA torque and the network planning, said the spokesperson. The flight times are to be matched to connecting flights. The aim is on the one hand to strengthen the torque in Vienna and, on the other hand, to expand the decentralized traffic from the federal countries.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a "Production Company" for the group sister AUA. Thus, among other things, Barcelona and Rome would be served with AUA flight number, but primarily with Eurowings device.
Ryanair’s daughter Laudamotion announced only on Thursday to increase the fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost flight sending four Ryanair machines and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called “wet-lease”, which the union will be sending four aircraft to Vienna.
Ryanair’s chief Michael O’Leary’s battle announcement that Lauda will have overcome the AUA in five years, AUA Board Andreas Otto said on Friday: “We will remain the number one in the location, in five, six or ten years.”
Queen-Daughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William, and Harry: As a kid, cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four is married. Beatrice is married!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: Earlier month in the Italy holidays, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) will have stopped the hand of his friend, Princess Beatrice (31), announced to the palace on Thursday.
“We are exceptionally happy to announce our engagement. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can’t wait to actually be married,” the couple, according to British media reports, told the official news release.
“We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us very much in the coming years full of love and happiness.”
Sister Eugenie knipped the pictures
The official engagement photos have recorded her sister, Princess Eugenie (29) – and also released on her Instagram account right away.
A Royal Feast
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More information on the date, place and everything else will be announced in the next few months.
It is certain, however, that the marriage of the number nine of the British throne succession and the real estate mogul will be a similar big festivity as Eugenie’s traulation on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what really triggers a heart failure or an infarct? Hamburg researchers now want to look at the inheritance of 9000 healthy and ill people.
About the analysis of the inheritance of 9,000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to get the causes of cardiovascular disease more detailed.
The research project is the largest of this type in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kuhne Foundation is promoting the project at 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the High Mountain Hospital Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diet are one of the essential influential risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is not sufficiently known. Now, the scientists want to compare the complete inheritance of 8,000 healthy people with the inheritance of 1,000 former patients of the UK’s of the university heart and vascular heart heart.
In more than 4,000 of the 20,000 relevant human genes, DNA’s potential disease-causing changes – so-called mutations – were currently known, the clinic said, and about 200 were added every year.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options, such as prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm, heart weakness and heart attacks. The data could also benefit in the exploration of other people's diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, head of the university's heart and vascular center, as well as new insights to interact with heart and heart.
The president of the Kuhne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also emphasized that there is a strong will to use the data to explore other diseases. The Davos Foundation's clinic has so far been treated with allergies especially. Now, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine and a professional for bioformat has been created in the Hamburg campus.
The biosamples of healthy participants come from Hamburgers who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, this is the largest local health study in the world. The inheritance encryption is strictly respected for the protection of anonymized data, the scientists insured. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabytes) from the University, Mogerch said.
The inheritance of a person can be decrypted today within 24 hours, according to UKE. The pure costs for this will be at 1300 euros. The first gene sequence, which was published in 2001, has costed several hundred million euros. The study is expected to start on 1 October 2020, and all 9000 samples will be analyzed at the end of 2020.
Nigerian police released hundreds of mistreated boys
In Nigeria, the police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Coran school. According to indications by local inhabitants, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the minor victims, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. "The victims were abused. Some of them said Sabo was raped by their teachers.
Indeed, the protectors of their teachers were held under "most decent and inhuman conditions," Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children nine years old, were chained in a small space.
According to the information, the Koran school has been for about ten years. Inhabitants had informed the authorities of repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents had been shocked when they were teached about the states in the Koran school, Sabo said. They had not seen the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested, according to police.
In the mainly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Coran schools. They often replace the lack of state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed gangs. According to the UN refugee aid, more than 40,000 people fled over the borders in the neighbouring Niger state over the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria’s police releases 400 children from school
Police officers in a school in northern Nigeria have released nearly 400 students from accidental circumstances. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries indicating torture," said Yakubu Sabo, police spokesman in Kaduna.
The children were discovered on Thursday after a statement in an Islamic-pronounced school. The states were “humanly indignant” there. The officials held the school leader and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were held in their school as slaves and put in chains. Some were sexually abused. Television pictures showed default and injured students in a remarkably poor health condition.
World football election: further accusations of Messis and Klopps Cur
Football "Not valid signature"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gala in Milan, the World Football Association FIFA is the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth honor and therefore record.
After Nicaragua’s captain declared he never voted at the World Football Election, charges from other countries come to the FIFA. Egypt was not rated - with a curious reason.
In the past few years, the FIFA has proven to be accurate: the World Cup spending, the dubious plans of her President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials, but the FIFA World Footballers' vote has not yet been suspicious of the national sympathetics - if you refrain from the vote of the national person.
However, after Nicaragua’s captain had already complained he did not vote at all, further unreligious statements are now complaining that the voices of National Trainer Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account, in fact they did not dive in the official and publicly viewable vote.
The FIFA apologizes that "the signatures on the election forms were issued in large letters and therefore were not valid" and that the Egyptian association has been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without answer.
Sudan trainer also surprises
While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that the trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally officially rated: with Lionel Messi on the place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three.
Nicaragua’s Captain Juan Barrera also claimed, “I did not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All my voice is wrong, thank you,” he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan football association simply voted in his name.
The report came from the association on Friday: True, but of course it was no intention. The completed election documents were "improperly" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan FIFA choice, but it was said in a statement of the association.
The other cases now examine the FIFA in an investigation, but emphasizes that the election process was supervised externally by the advisory company PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains an undisputed winner of the World Football Choice - and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the Year.
Ukraine Affair: Ranghohe Republicans speak for official investigation
"I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the US state Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this can lead from here, it will be determined by the facts of the President's actions that he wants to know more about the whistleblower.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky in a telephone call to investigate the activities of the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have so far retained criticism of Trump because of the whistle blower affair, but only a few have seen discomfort. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's party, and the moderate governor of Virginia had already turned against Trump's politics several times, such as the relief of environmental protection laws and the heaging of immining.
As another higher-range Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, spoke for the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and go on her ground."
Scott and Baker, as Governor of the United States, formally did not participate in the proceedings against Trump, which will be decided in the Congress, so their statements are mostly symbolically important. Nevertheless, the first senators of the Republicans have also critically expressed themselves on the situation.
The affair might incur in the initiation of an official deletion proceedings against Trump, Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation, and they claim him abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefits.
There is no precise schedule for the removal proceedings. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impeachment. The decision on actual removal fell in the Senate, where Trump's republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects of success of such a proceedings are small.
Were torturers at the board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, raped and killed in Libyan refugee camps.
German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had unlawfully attacked the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Lybian refugees on board.
New heavy accusations against rackets are now loud, so three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects have been captured in a receiving camp in Messina (Sicily) after German migrants have recognized their migrants in Italy.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured, and even killed, Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24).
NGOs and aid organizations now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes to the ships. "We cannot scan who people are. They come without passports," said Neuebauer. Torture was one of the main reasons why people flee Libya. Therefore, it is very likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships.
Italy's former right-wing internal minister Matteo Salvini called for an apology immediately by Rackete, which is still identified in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk Seeks Extradition Record at Tesla
Tesla’s chief Elon Musk has given its electric car company a strong boost on the stock exchange with the view of new record numbers.
“We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries,” Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the Electrek blog.
The demand was strong, so Tesla could make 110,000 orders, said Musk’s newsletter, the challenge is to bring the cars to the customer quickly, and Tesla needs to offer as many resources as possible to the quarter end.
Investors liked that: Tesla’s shares were traded with more than 6%, so strongly the rate has no longer increased for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered about 95,000 cars, thus achieving its best value to date.
Musk needs records to achieve its high targets. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, in the current and coming quarter of the year, six digits need to be made. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is demanded, but here are low winning margins. Despite the boom there were last losses.
US budget dispute: Again only one bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without an ordinary budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional funding until 21 November.
Although the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the expenditure limits for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again before the new fiscal year starting on 1 October without expenditure schedules. The Senate has followed the administration of the Representative House on Thursday and has a transitional financing of the President on Monday until.
Shutdown turned off
Preliminarily, the Federal Administration is now financed at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the 2019 financial year ended on Monday. This is because the Congress has failed to agree on the 12 expenditure laws in time that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the expenditure laws reflect priorities of the Democrats who have hardly opportunities in the Senate dominated by the Republicans.
In the Senate, the Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion for wall building, one of President Trump's major priorities. The Democrats are disturbing the wall building plans and their funding, which had actually been intended for other military buildings and projects in December 2018.
In the wall building, the ghosts divide
It is currently unclear how the parties want to approach this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve expenditure laws in the coming seven weeks is a renewal of transitional funding beyond November 21, and then a shutdown is not excluded.
In the context of the Congress's continued inability to agree on the twelve expenditure laws in time, and the associated risk of a shutdown gain ideas for the automation of the process of popularity.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization is expected to be open to alone women and lesbians: the Paris National Assembly voted with a large majority for a government legislation, according to which all women can use an in-vitro fertilization, which is expected to increase the demand for anonymous seed donations.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that in the future numerous "children without father" could grow up.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, Minister of Health Agnès Buzyn defended as a “chances” for society. It forms the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or homosexual parents. According to her idea, the costs of artificial fertilization for all women are to be borne by social insurance.
Fertilization with sperm by dead husband continues to be prohibited
With a small majority, the National Assembly, however, rejected an amendment that widows should give access to the sperm of their dead husband. In Belgium, Spain and the UK, the artificial fertilization is allowed to be made "post-dead". In Germany, there was in the past a case in which women were in vain on the issue of the sperm of a dece.
Many members of the Government Party La République en Marche (The Republic in Movement, LREM) by President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had pronounced for the artificial fertilization of the deceased partner's sperm.
The initiators of the now failed amendment believe it is unfair that, although a widow can be fertilized in the future with the sperm of an unknown, but not with the sperm of her own partner.
Until now, artificial fertilization in France is allowed only heterosexual couples who cannot be born children. They must be married or live together at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in summer that the motherhood will continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian couples it is nevertheless often difficult.
Climate compensation: U.S. calls for flight fee becomes louder
A lot will be flighted to universities, so in the future the country wants to leave climate taxes there, and the rectors say they have no money for it, but now they are also under pressure internally.
The universities should also be limited when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschule
The debate on a climate taxation on flights from universities and universities, which was delayed before the summer pause, has been reinforced. After the National Rectors Conference has not reacted skeptically to a corresponding prompt from the Greenen-Black Coalition, the plans must be given support from the universities.
Russia once again captures North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB, the detainees were fishing illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. There was a shooting change between the border protectors and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, the fisherman was later injured.
The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortage, and the North Korean fishermen were travelling in Russian territorial waters, where Russia’s coastal guards, according to their own information, patrols to protect their marine biological resources.
30,000 ink fish captured
30,000 ink fish were discovered and captured on the boats, and three fishermen and two motor boats were captured and brought to Nachodka and Posjet to Vladivostok.
Russia’s fisheries authority had not issued fishing licences to North Koreans this year, and thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been occasionally arrested this year.
The head of the Association of Russian fisheries companies in the remote eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also accused of high environmental damage by North Korean fishermen. They fished with prohibited in Russia. They would also be pushed out of the sea with small living beings, where they would simply be equipped with 200 years.
Future only 18,000: US reduces asylum revenue
The "largest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country on Earth is shot against protective seekers: As the Foreign Ministry confirms in Washington, the upper limit for the legal admission of refugees is further decreased; in the future, the most vulnerable believers and Iraqi asylum are to be obtained.
The U.S. government wants to lower the already historically low border for the receipt of new refugees again. In the 2020 commercial year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, no more than 18,000 people will be left to the country, as the U.S. Foreign Ministry said.
President Donald Trump’s government has dramatically lowered the readiness to receive protection seekers from all over the world in recent years, and under Barack Obama’s predecessor had earned much higher receiving boundaries.
The highest limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee program in 1980. The Foreign Ministry nevertheless called the U.S. a "most merciful and generous nation in history", a formulation that strongly recalls the language use of the U.S. president.
“Responsible dealing” with refugees aims to allow refugees to return to their homelands to help rebuild there, Trump said. For his tough course in migration policy, he gets much encouragement from followers, but there is also massive criticism.
A big point of dispute is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to remove. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the National Emergency Status. Whether there is a time-connection between the current action and the current internal policy developments in the US capital is unclear.
The U.S. government, according to representation from the Foreign Office, wants to focus on the receipt of two groups of refugees: people who are persecuted because of their faith and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are in danger, as stated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The U.S. wants to achieve that people from this "northern triangle" of Central America apply for asylum in other countries, and in this context the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras to prevent immigration on the U.S. southern border to Mexico.
Court orders release of Orang-Utan from Zoo
An Orang-Utan female was transferred from the former Buenos Aires Zoo to a capture station for human monkeys in the United States at the request of the Argentinean justice. The "Sandra" born in 1986 at the Rostock Zoo was declared the rights of a "non-human person" but was assigned to Gilgue.
Since the 53 kilograms of human affins are unable to adapt to their lives in the wilderness, they are expected to live in the field of the Center for Great Apes in Florida, where there are already 21 other orangutans and 31 shimpanses, including "Bubbles" in the county of Kansas, formerly the popstar of Michael Jackson's pets.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent a few years in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before being moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 prospected process for "Sandras" by animal protectors has helped the Zoo of Buenos Aires to be transformed into an ecopark of education.
Record for Swiss Extremeberger: 550 meters in 46 minutes

Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
U.S. sports product manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant profit profit despite the trade conflict with China. Net profit increased to $1.4 billion in the expired quarter (about $1.3 billion). That is 25% more than in the previous year.
Revenues increased to $10.7 billion in the three months until the end of August.

Investors were pleased to respond to the quarterly numbers - the sports product manufacturer’s shares increased by more than five percent.
Life-long stadium ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments on football professional Juan Jesus from AS Rome, the Italian capital club has imposed a lifelong stadium ban against a fan. The Brazilian defender Jesus was scorned by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news from Rome and urged his club to take action at 2016. "@officiallasaAsTo know what you already do.
The club responded late Thursday. He reported the fan's account at Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma fans can never visit a club game again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly scandal racism scores against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. We must identify the responsible at the Sunday Party and throw out of the stages.
The Italian authorities have now devoted 38 fans of Juventus Turin's record master with stadium bans. Four of them are expected to no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, police said.
The fans are in connection with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups around Juventus. Twelve are accused, among other things, of severe depression, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched the investigations with an announcement last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra leaders are supposed to put tickets behind the black trade. They are supposed to have “military controlled” the ticket trade for the fan curve, and are supposed to have Juventus employees expressed themselves to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, the generation Z is politically - all years are considered with handsome names. Look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well these labels describe the respective feeling of life of young people?
"The Crabs Come!" This reputation officially launched on September 21 the crab catch at the Gucheng Lake in Gaochun, which also announced the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as was announced by the Nanjing Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern excursor of Nanjing in Jiangsu province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. The city offers all its ideal conditions in environmental respects with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent waters."
The people of Gaochun have already started crab growing in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a major industry that provided high income and became an important part of the economic development of Gaochun.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform for the "distribution of power, optimization of administration and authorities" and has carefully built the service network for "approval under one roof, a law enforcement team, a network of services, a platform for loans", which is intended to provide the city's environment for approvals, services and development.
Gaochun has made the advantages on the site, along with the connection to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui, and has made use of the development zone and its position as the international "Slow City" as a keyword for the agriculture, as well as intelligent high-end production companies, companies for biomedical technology, energy and environmental protection,
Conflict between Iran and the United States: Ruhani speaks of End of Sanctions - Trump
Iran’s President Hassan Ruhani, after returning from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged U.S. offer to revoke sanctions. The United States would have put an end to all sanctions in exchange for talks with the Tehran leadership, Ruhani said on his official website.
However, U.S. President Donald Trump contradicted the Iranian colleague on Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed against him so that there will be a meeting.
Ruhani indicates this: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron have been present in New York and have concluded that a meeting will take place. "And America says I raised the sanctions," Ruhani said clearly.
However, this incident is not in an acceptable manner, Ruhani criticized; in view of the current criminal measures and the "poisoned atmosphere of the maximum pressure" no one can predict the outcome of negotiations.
Early this week Chancellor Angela Merkel had met with Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreements negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This aims to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 aftershadows
After western Turkey was shot by two earthquakes within a short time, the fear of a disaster grows. 34 people were wounded in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake earlier, there have been almost 200 aftershots, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for safety reasons, and hundreds of buildings were damaged. The earthquake of strength 5.8 shocked the Marmara region from Istanbul on Thursday and triggered panic in the million metropolis. Now the government wants to use a Commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said. In the city itself, the latent danger is always ignored. Each year, poorly built residences fall down - among other things, in need of the many smaller earthquakes that Istanbul regularly shake.
City planners like the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas registered in the center as refugees have long been grown. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August the Istanbul Engineering Chamber had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake.
The epicenter of the earthquake on Thursday was in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and about seven kilometres depth, as the disaster protection authority Afad reported. A smaller earthquake caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu reported on Twitter that injured or damage had not been reported. The state station TRT showed people who ran in panic from the houses. Students were brought from the district of Silivri for safety reasons. Some students were crying as they were seen on pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly threatened to earthquake. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called Northern Anatolic Disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earthquake. Turkey is always shaken by earthquakes. One of the most fatal was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul.
Researchers feared that an earthquake of strength could threaten 7.1 to 7.4, but when the earthquake occurs, it is unclear. The earthquake on Thursday already occurred the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called Go-Bags packed with all the needs, standing next to home doors, and schools teach children how they have to behave when the earth waves. When the next big earthquake comes, be unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York, eight people were injured, some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu pursued the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom). According to his report, two minarets of mosques dropped into the Avlar and Sariyer districts.
Warning for shots in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users reported panic. Buildings cracked. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Phone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than Tuesday, a user writes. The head of the Turkish Red Half Moon, Kerem Clinic, warned of retreats via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that were visible damaged.
According to the official information, the date of the earthquake is indicated at 13.59 a.m. (local time) and only minutes after the first earthquake, according to CNN Turkey, there was a subsequent earthquake that was indicated with a strength of 4.0 on the Judge scale.
On Tuesday, there was an earthquake of strength 4.6 that shocked the Turkish Marmara region – it was to be felt until Istanbul, and its epicenter was located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropolitan areas, the Disaster Protection Authority Afad said on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that provided headlines on Tuesday: even Pakistan was hit by a heavy earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul could occur - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe it will unload at some point - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. It has become more likely, he told CNN Türk. "This could be the signs of a larger earthquake," Ersoy said in a statement. "Earlier or later the big earthquake will also come."
There had been an incident a few weeks ago - the earthquake also caused great concerns in Istanbul. There had also been a heavy earthquake in Albania only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Even this year, at the lake of Boden, the earth had been injured.
Parliament: New combustion in Ukraine Affair

USA: United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - flight redirected
Because a passenger was imprisoned in the board toilet, a flight was redirected by United Airlines. The toilet door was blocked during the flight from Washington to San Francisco in 1554, the airline reported, according to US media.
During a non-planned landing in Denver on Wednesday evening (local time), the woman was finally able to be freed from the narrow cabin, about an hour she had been locked in, US media wrote on appeal to other passengers, and the passengers had to switch the plane to San Francisco for the next flight.
In a video widespread on the Internet, which is intended to come from flight 1554 according to US media, it is to see how several people try to free the woman. "We're working now to open the door, Ma'am. We're going to get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it. The airline apologised to all passengers.
Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan Writes Brexit Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan work with the entire Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unrecognizable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka’s famous narrative “The Transformation” British success author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel "The Kakerlake" (original: The Cockroach) will be published in German on November 27, the Diogene publisher (Zurich) told that it is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams" who has been ignored or hated by nothing in his previous life, but now at once the most powerful man in Britain.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "When the parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged in a critical moment when ministers lie shamelessly as once the Soviet leaders, when Brexiteers appeared in high positions to bring about the disaster of a no-deal, then a writer must wonder about what he can do in the early."
Kafka's first published narrative in 1915 is Gregor Samsa, who one morning awakens and sees himself "to an immense ungarn" gradually excluded by family and society and eventually destroys. "Ian McEwan bows himself before Kafka to describe a world that stands head," Diogene publisher said.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria’s railway infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary get fluster brakes to reduce noise load by goods trains, and sections of the train connections between Graz and Györ and Vienna Neustadt and Sopron are modernized and electrified.
According to the EU authorities, this is intended to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU's infrastructure box "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All travels cancelled until 31 October
The German tour operator Thomas Cook has cancelled all travels until 31 October 2019, including, for "insolvency law reasons," the company announced on Thursday night.
The bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which are already paid or fully paid, are also affected. As regards travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company opened. In combination with the insolvency insurance, the further approach will be checked.
Thomas Cook in Germany was advised to the bridge of the British mother company and had filed insolvency application on Wednesday, including Neckermann Traveling, Öger Tours and Bucher Traveling, employing around 2,000 people in Germany.
The insurer wants to send hotel money back
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad, which are currently hosting Thomas-Cook leaves, are expected to receive money from the Zurich insurance. Payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that travellers are no longer asked for extra payments, according to Zurich.
Based on the booking information and without submission of separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now expected to receive 50 percent of outstanding payments, as said a spokesman of the German Press Agency in Zurich. "This applies immediately and provided that Thomas-Cook travellers from these hotels will not be requested or otherwise required to pay individual hotel invoices," Bern said.
The insurance responded to reports of hotel guests who were forced to pay their accommodation on site themselves. Some had to place more than 1,000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Consumer Centres Association had sharply criticized this.
How many hotels are affected will be voted on Friday with the insolvent travel agent, the insurance spokesman said. According to Thursday, 70,000 Thomas-Cook package holidays were still on the way from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured holidays and returns from Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators are trying to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
The Zurich Insurance payments now announced to hotels, however, only help travelers who are currently on the journey. For Thomas-Cook customers who want to fly on holidays, it seems bad. On Thursday night the company said all travels would be cancelled until October 31, including. This also applies for such bookings that have already been paid.
As regards travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In consultation with insolvency insurance, the further approach will be examined. In principle, insurance Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa.
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which is represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of reimbursement of the travel price and claim their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry Destroys Explosion in Angola
Prince Harry has continued Lady Diana’s commitment for a long time, now he is moving directly to the traces of his mother in Africa.
With a blue splitter protective vest, British Prince Harry in Angola fired and destroyed an explosive mine.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at Dirico, on Friday morning in front of running TV cameras, he made the fire circle. In a secure distance, the explosive bodies exploded in the Savannah landscape without harm. Although alone the Halo Trust has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades of bloody conflict in the African country.
On the fifth day of his journey in Africa, Harry then wanted to walk directly to the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same explosive master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to return the way she went at the time. The pictures that Princess Diana went through a spacious mining field in 1997 had gone around the world.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day tour of Africa that has started in South Africa’s Cape Town.
Brexit negotiations: the risk of no deal remains acute
In fact, Premier Boris Johnson had clearly determined that there will not be a third breakthrough of the Brexit negotiations with him, but what statements are forever in the polarization of Britain. However, the recent judgment of the Supreme Court in the UK floats like a damoclean sword of the negotiation over the blonde.
Boris Johnson thinks deal is possible
However, the pressure does not seem to pass noticeably to Johnson, and in the meantime, when he visited a hospital, he made suggestions that he would support an extension of the negotiations in the event of a non-agreement until the end of October:
You know, we're going to follow the law.
At the same time, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best with a deal, I'm carefully optimistic that it's going to work.
The Brexit negotiators in Brussels are gradually running. Six weeks still, the EU and the British negotiators have time to prevent Britain's exit from the European Union without any agreements. However, the recent talks have no further breakthrough. An agreement may not seem rather difficult to imagine until the end of October.
U.S. Authority: More deaths by e-cigarettes
The number of deaths associated with the use of e-cigarettes in the U.S. has increased to twelve. Moreover, there are now 805 confirmed and likely injuries in this connection, the U.S. Health Agency CDC reported. A study seems not to be reported to more than 900 injuries in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Fear of new protests in Egypt grows
Mohammed Ali's videos have been shared millions of times into online networks. The Spanish-living entrepreneur and actor calls for a "volk revolution" in it. For today's Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military who accuses criticism of corruption and mistreat economy.
In any case, the security authorities were alarmed. In the centre of Cairo, there was already a reinforced police presence. Several metro stations were closed, roads were locked around the central Tahrir square. In recent days, the police had strengthened their road controls, and the phones of pedestrians partially searched for news and photos in connection with the protests.
On 20 September, the protesters also gathered around the Tahrir Square.
Last weekend it came to protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. Such an open protest had not occurred in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces responded to it hard. According to Human Rights Watch (HRW) reportedly, almost 2,000 false appeals were arrested for last week.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Hence, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general ruled the country since 2013, after the democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Mursi has been condemned in part.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland Expedition Back
Polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned from his Grönland expedition on Friday, and he was welcomed at his arrival at the port of Hamburg, among others by Skipper Boris Herrmann, climate activist Greta Thunberg, who had brought over the Atlantic Ocean with the "Malizia" race jacht.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs has investigated and documented the consequences of global warming in recent months on his sailboat "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement was a blessing, said the polar researcher. He has been waiting for years for the young generation to speak. It has been known for decades that the Earth is warming. However, many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens on the sea is often happening without the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the impacts of global warming and the blending of the seas.
For his "Fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world seas" the Polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt has been awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" during the Hamburg Week. "For all of us who have given the survival of the oceans at the heart, Arved Fuchs is a great example in the last time in the award-winning.
Teure spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid for nudels 430 euros
430 euros for two dishes of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near Engelsburg in Rome: two Japanese tourists seemed too much, although the two women paid the bill with 80 euros of drinking money, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered warm reactions.
“Such cases are harmful to Rome’s reputation, and we call on the police to investigate whether it’s a fraud here,” said a spokesman of Federact, the association of the travel guides in Rome, according to the Roman newspaper Il Messaggero.
Prompt came the reaction of the restaurant owners. The Japanese women had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified itself. However, this is not to be seen from the invoice. Also a drinking cash of up to 20% of the invoice was normal, the host said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? U.S. President Donald Trump might actually be faced with a turbulent revelations of the past days, which Democrats want to examine this with their investigation at the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the speech is weeks until a decision would fall.
At the beginning of the scandal, it is supposed to be the phone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj. The accusation of the whistleblower, who has been concerned about the national security and the democracy of the United States, will ultimately be forced to express the opponents to the public.
The core of this project is also understood in the meanwhile published membership of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the complete wording, but the phone call of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story in which the center of Trump is mainly his personal attorney: Rudy Giuliani.
The story starts from the public in May 2019, when the New York Times reports Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet very useful information in Kiev with the President Selenskyj just elected, and the attorney himself knows very accurately that his intentions are illegal.
The lawyer and former New York Mayor seem to have infected himself with right conspiracy fantasies, fixed on Trump's counter-candidate at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton has conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said then to take an occasion for Russia's investigations in the US.
It is exactly about the investigation that Trump will talk so prominently to Selenskyj at the phone in July. The version of Giulianis and the President is: the former Vice-President and currently realistic candidate to the presidential candidate of the Ukrainian Democrats, Joe Biden, has stopped the bikin's bikin's surveillance, as the Ukrainian representative of the Obama.
As Joe Biden claimed that the Ukrainian prosecutor-general had to go, the investigation against the gas company was already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected, and Schokin was also accused of deeply corrupt possibles, the US government was not even the only western partner who urged Obama on his dismissal.
Instagram disruptions Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances at Instagram and Facebook. Therefore, mostly Germany, UK and Spain are affected. Users report on the website allestörden.de that Facebook has not repeatedly loaded since about 15.30 a.m. Also Instagram says that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disturbances, although not in the same way.
Instagram and Co. often affected by disturbances
It’s not the first massive disturbance this year. Already in March and July the services have failed for several hours. And as in previous cases, users also use this time especially on Twitter to make their trouble air.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been saved from the Chilean air force from the Antarctic ice. They were on the road with a hose boat and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the misfortune - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter for mounting.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
“At 9:30 p.m. we received the message, just ten ago we started, and good 20 minutes spater we were over the tube boat.”
Since 1977, Poland operates on King George Island the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers were safely returned to their research station.
Caution: Smartphone NIE charges wirelessly
Practical but harmful
Although inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, it should not be used.
Since recently, several new smartphones have come to the market that support wireless charges and sell themselves very well - above all the new iPhone-11 models, we want to remember again a study from early July. The wireless loading of mobile devices is extremely convenient, but not necessarily recommendable.
Higher temperature enables battery
Researchers warn from the wireless loading of smartphones. According to the findings of the Univerity of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. This is why the heat development is significantly greater. If you load a normal phone by cable, the power consumption is always heated to 27 degrees in three hours.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of the batteries is a crucial factor. Each degree plays a role. When loading with higher temperatures, the battery has not only capacity but also keeping it as long as it is overall. Therefore, the lifespan is still less helpful. Therefore, the researchers suggest that the iPhone is always charged by cable.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply put the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are now already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without boring cable salad and hard-consuming plug-in fumes should not be applied in the case of Qi.
Everest-Stau photographer: 13 eight thousand in six months
A Nepalese mountain climber has climbed within six months 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition organizer said.
The former soldier wants to climb every eight thousand in seven months. Purja called his project Mission Possible. He once made international headlines: From him comes a picture of mountain climbers standing on Mount Everest Snake.
The picture of the mass andrange caused a debate on stronger safety measures on the 8848 meters high mountain and the highest peaks of the Earth. In May eleven climbers died at the climb within a few days.
A problem for Purja could become the rise of the 14th eight thousand: currently Chinese authorities block Xixabangma mountain in Tibet, which is why it is called bad weather. Purja wrote on Twitter early week that Nepal’s government wanted to talk to China to enable him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman told Friday, "We suspect the elephants were poisoned."
The four Cadaver were found in a protected area near the famous former rock fortress Sigiriya visited by many tourists. The animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old, according to the police spokesman. An autopsie was arranged to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers in whose land the animals had previously held harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed annually by elephants. This is mostly happening when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
Only about 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka are estimated, and the death penalty is theoretically on their killings.
Detained British oil tank leaves Iran
The British oil tank "Stena Impero" leaves the port town Bandar Abbas more than two months after Iran's establishment. This announced the Sea Office Bandar Abbas, according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian revolutionary gardens had failed the tank riding under British flag on 19 July.
Management of Thomas Cook in criticism
The responsible economic committee of the Sub-House wants to examine the breakthrough of the travel gigant Thomas Cook, as well as the question of why the UK government didn't like to financially join the survival struggling companies. "Our interest is to be done with a company's supervision as well as control by external auditors."
According to experts, genes are overestimated in the risk of intestinal cancer
The role of genes in the increased family cancer risk has been apparently overestimated so far. This conclusion is that researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg come in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family nutritional habits are likely to weigh more severe than they so far assumed.
Elon Musk Increases Tesla Shares
This was written by Musk in an e-mail published on Thursday by the industry blog "Electrek" to Tesla employees. The demand was strong, so that Tesla could make 110'000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the customer, and Tesla needs to offer as many resources as possible to the quarter end.
Investors liked the information: Tesla’s shares were traded with more than 6%, so strongly the price has no longer increased for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered about 95’000 cars, thus achieving its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high targets. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, in the current and coming quarter of the year, six digits have to be made. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here are the winning margins low. Despite the boom there were last losses.
Will Britain’s Government Deal with Brexit Law? Johnson Retained
Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson kept covered by whether he is looking for opportunities for a disruption of the last legislation adopted by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit, and on a question he said on Friday only to journalists that his government will comply with applicable law.
The law provides that the government must apply for a displacement of the exit date should not have agreed with the EU until mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulating law" that makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political shikans" to overcome the law. Johnson could use a procedural strike that would displace the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit.
"We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is to agree."
Iran seems to enrich uranium
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has raised pressure on the European contracting partners in the dispute on the rescue of the historical nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, the European states show inability or lack of readiness when it comes to concrete actions," Rohani said Thursday at a press conference at the edge of the UN General Assembly in New York.
Background is the conflict about the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained the commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The U.S. rise from the agreement in 2018 in soleness to react to a "maximum pressure" towards a change of course in the Middle Eastern policy, which is considered to be aggressive.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic now uses or at least has prepared for use with uranium installed in early September, and Iran also prepares for the construction of more than 300 additional centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not ready to carry their part of the deal, and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and burden of pressing U.S. sanctions, Rohani said, but there will still be further discussions that hopefully bring a solution.
Rohani continues to dispute Iran’s engagement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia, Germany, France and Britain followed on Monday the US estimate that Tehran is responsible for the attack. Originally the Iran-backed Huthi rebels had made theirselves known about the attack, which was done by the US as a false commitment.
"Those who raised such accusations have to provide evidence for this," said Rohani. However, the European leaders could not have been able to talk with him during the UN General Debate, but instead only call for the rebels in Yemen to be unable to carry out an attack like this. Rohani had in recent days with Chancellor of the United Kingdom, President of the United Kingdom, Mac Angela Merkel, France.
Before possible talks with U.S. President Trump, the U.S. administration’s widespread sanctions should first be revoked, Mr. Rohani called on the government in Washington to move towards a “dialog and reason” policy.
Comet of another star crosses the solar system
Astronomers are currently watching a comet from the depths of the space, which was successful once before. The comet allows conclusions on other solar systems.
What was only one assumption at first is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was baptized to 2I/Borisov after his explorer and has awakened the interest of astronomers around the world.
The widespread comet was discovered on 30 August by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Follow-ups from various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet but also showed that it is not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object seen at a passage of our solar system after 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017.
2I/Borisov gives astronomers the rare chance to get insights into a foreign solar system from the nearby before it disappears at no revision. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to that of our own system's reporting speed, as the astrophysical institute of the Canary Canadians reported about half, which is high at about 150,000 kilometers per hour.
According to the analyses, the comet is responsible for travelling on a so-called hyperbel pathway that leads it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It has also been discovered to the first name of the object of heavenly bodies.
The astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in the approach. This remains for researchers many months for research. "The object will achieve the greatest brightness in mid-December and then will be seen by April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes," explained Farnocchia.
Several observatories have already taken the visitors into view, so a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, in a first investigation of the diameter of the heaven object at 2 to 16 kilometers.
Researchers from the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar silence star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to such comets of our solar system, and that indicates that their composition must be similar to our solar system."
The IAU estimates that the discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, how often such tip visits are, it is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly get a planned satellite mission of the European space agency Esa.
By 2028, the agency wants to station the three-piece space sound "Comet Interceptor" on a waiting position 1.5 million kilometers away from the Earth. It is intended to range on either an untouched fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor like 1OUU.
First landing on Beijing’s new Mega-Airport Daxing
At the time before the 70th birthday of the People’s Republic, it’s up to this: on the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of China United Airlines is landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, about 45 million passengers will be transferred annually at the new airport, and 2025 will be already 72 million. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China’s latest prestige project is also called “seastars” due to its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four start-up and landing tracks, which will be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway carries passengers to the city centre of Beijing in just 20 minutes.
The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006, has been repeatedly displaced, and a first passenger machine has been landing in Beijing after four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - of which the UK Space Agency dreams. It is possible to make this flight a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company already developed by the Oxfordshire company.
In order to advance the project, the UK space agency wants to work closer with the Australian. A flight from the UK capital to the Australian metropolis is currently about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport, the Concorde from 1976 to the conclusion of its operations, the United States-United States-United States-United States-United States-United States-Unites.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound.
Uprising in Washington: Trump wants to track anonymous tipmakers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump wants to track possible unclear positions in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the information to the whistleblower," Trump said Thursday before U.S. Envoy staff at the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and in the past one was "a bit different" than today.
This was considered as an intimidation attempt against tipmakers. The event was actually not public. However, several U.S. media spread audio interferences from the talk on Friday. Democrats responded angry to the statement of the president.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives announced preparations on Tuesday for an official dismissal proceedings against Trump, based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence employee who raises serious accusations against Trump and his government center.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government employees that the U.S. President "uses the power of his office" to achieve that a different country will mix into the U.S. election in its favour of 2020.
At the center of the accusations is a controversial telephone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleague to investigate that could harm his political rival Joe Biden.
The whistleblower accused the White House with regard to the Ukrainian telephonate also of the crackdown: Leading government employees had endeavored to keep the accurate text of the conversation under the ceiling. An electronic text protocol was removed instead. This was provided in a databank on the instruction of lawmakers from the White House.
The reporter’s identity is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it should be an employee of the foreign intelligence service CIA.
Trump once again questioned the source’s credibility on Friday. In a series of tweets on the topic, the president wrote, among other things, that the “so-called whistleblower” has spread information from second hand, which would have proven to be incorrect, therefore perhaps there are no tipgivers or spies.
As Trump expressed in New York on those reported to the whistleblower, the president of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reacted disturbed and complained, Trump’s statement once again underpined the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, several committees have been conducting investigations against Trump and his environment for months, and in the face of Ukraine’s allegations, the Democrats are now moving forward with new strength in order to launch a possible ruling proceedings against Trump.
“The whistleblower gave us a schedule for our investigation,” said the head of the intelligence committee at the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked ship sharply, charged him with a wrong representation of the things and again called for the committee’s chief withdrawal. Trump regularly blackmailed ship and had already requested the withdrawal month.
More than 300 former U.S. government employees from the security and foreign policy sector, who operated mostly under democratic, but also under Republican presidents, appeared in a statement published Friday behind the investigation for a possible removal proceedings by the Democrats.
There is no precise schedule for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats might strive for a so-called impeachment procedure. The decision on an actual removal of office fell in the Senate, where Trump's republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects of success of such a procedure are small.
VW Operating Board: Jobs are "slicking" decreased
The VW brand’s plans to further reduce production costs could be at the charge of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern drives the car manufacturer’s business council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from 10 billion euros by 2023 by two billion euros. Of which is expected to be saved 500 million euros already this year.
One key to this is the employment costs. The 2016 future pact negotiated between companies and board of business already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basically, a job can only be decreased by the car manufacturer if it is proven that the related activities are no longer required.
As our newspaper now learned from boards of operations, however, jobs in production, which actually weren't to arrange, are "sliding" by another path, which is to say passes the official course, so that free regular jobs would often not be reoccupied.
In these cases, the Board of Operations has no possibility to force the reconstruction. Now, in many places, it is lack of employee who increases working compression, the concerns about a gradually bleeding of the vehicle plants would be greater. This increases the fear that the production of vehicles could be gradually aligned with the adjustment towards Germany and Europe.
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide even more and control new projects centrally, which is also intended to reduce costs and accelerate decisions – behind it is the goal of increasing productivity and competitiveness.
For example, this year’s production costs per vehicle would drop for the first time since 2013 compared to the previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which will be presented on October 24 in Wolfsburg, would be shortened by 1.1 hours. Exact numbers for the production duration call VW is not round 7 in our newspaper.
20 hours.
In our region, Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which vehicles are manufactured. The works Braunschweig and Salzgitter made components. For Wolfsburg, VW-Intern applies the rule of faust that there is to be built 800,000 cars annually.
As Tostmann announced last year, however, in Wolfsburg, a million cars are expected to be “perspective” from the band, which aims to make it possible to bundle the golf production in the stem plant – because the Zwickau factory by re-engineering to the location of e-car production delivers the golf production.
Furthermore, the SUVs Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales rates of Golf and Tiguan have last declined, and therefore the expectations of the Gulf 8 now rest in spite of all efforts to build e-mobility, it is intended to remain the bread and butter car of Wolfsburgers.
With Voodoo Forced to Prostitute: Traffickers Condemned
Young women from Nigeria have been detained with oaths, getting into the Ruhr area and forced to be prostituted. Six alleged traders have to be in prison.
Six alleged traffickers from Nigeria have been convicted on Friday in Bochum to testing and detention punishments of up to eight years and three months. The accused had sexualized and forced young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought in hose boats over the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan slabs. However, the dream of a better future did not fulfil. Arriving in Germany, they were distributed on various bordels to deal with the alleged slab costs of an average of 25,000 euros.
The accused - four men and two women - had admitted the insertion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on Bordella in the trial. "The work made women physically and mentally difficult to create," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann in the judgment. "Some were really annoyed."
The judgments are concerning commercial and band-based insertions of foreigners, human trafficking, retention and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm’s ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group has again threatened the Ufo flight companion union with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will "informate on 14 October about the workfighting measures in the LH Group," Ufo Tariff Board Daniel Flohr told Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have rejected it for months to conduct the Ufo collective negotiations.
At this point, Ufo is now strengthened after a decision by the Labour Court in Frankfurt. Lufthansa wanted to note that the collective agreements were not terminated. The Court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined to file appeals. "That a second court sees the matter completely different, I feel unlikely," said Ufo Board Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted a request to the Frankfurt National Labour Court to review the status of the UFO as a trade union, and the company argued that the trade union has not established a representative board for months and is therefore unable to fill out its role as a collective partner.
There was a violent leadership dispute in the Sparting Union, in which numerous members of the Board and the Advisory Board have resigned, including the long-standing union leader Nicoley Baublies, and the Ufo had exposed an urgent vote on the strike of the cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July due to the doubt of their leadership.
Easy Entry: Saudi Arabia Announces New Visa System
Until now, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but it is intended to change now. The country at the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa rules.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia will attract more international tourists in the future, and by 2030, the tourism commission will increase the payment of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year.
“The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historical moment for our country,” said the president of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult to access to tourists. Visa is usually given only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with family members of the desert state. The new rules hope that the Conservative Kingdom is more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riad will reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In the middle of September, several missiles and drones had hit two most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. In the following, the national oil production broke drastically, the oil price shot again.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparations for wedding feast
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos in her Instagram story on Thursday (local time) where she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others organized a young girlfriend in Los Angeles.
Justin posted several colourful suits printed with bananas on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my smoking for the wedding." According to media reports, the prominent pair wants to marry church next weekend.
The Biebers gave themselves the yes word a year ago at a New York Stand Office, and there had been no greater party at the time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that the two had found a common level after initial problems: “If you don’t want to make compromises, you can’t have a relationship.”
Two deaths in aircraft crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed when a small aircraft collapsed in the west of Czech Republic. The wrack was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Metchin), the police told the dead about a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities have been looking for the machine since Thursday night after the crew had issued an emergency signal via GPS. During the search, a military helicopter was also in use. The cause of disaster is still to be determined. The crash site is about 30 kilometers south of Plzen and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European trees are threatened by extinction
In addition to pests, there are also diseases, foreign species, non-sustainable wood strikes and the growth of the cities causes the threat, reported the World Nature Protection Union IUCN in Brussels on Friday, which has examined the stocks of all 454 species of trees known in Europe. 265 of them are not on any other continent.
The IUCN shares endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered", "strongly endangered", "threatened from extinction" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct"; it listed more than 28,000 animal and plant species worldwide as endangered.
Eberesque and wild horse castany threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) is particularly threatened, one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency, said. "Most are threatened because populations are small anyway or by the conversion or weakening of their habitats."
It is also bad for the wild usual horse castans. They are considered as "dangerous" since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scale. The largest threat alongside a fungus is the Balkan mining movement. It has been considered less cast in the 1980s from Southeast Europe, and has hardly natural enemies in the continent.
Beef species and moose are also in danger
The IUCN scientists at the same time created new European red lists for soft animals, bushes and mushrooms. More than one fifth of soft animals and mushrooms and almost half of all kinds of bushes are threatened, according to the IUCN. This lies especially in the destruction of the wildlife, in the birds and in the climate.
“This report shows that the situation is precarious for many neglected and underestimated species, species that form the back of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet,” said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office.
Earthquake before Istanbul: 34 injured reported
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured, and deaths were not injured. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Therefore, hundreds of buildings have been damaged. Since the earthquake earlier, there have been almost 200 aftershadows. The earthquake of the strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region from Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the millions of metropolis.
Now the government wants to use a Commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced, and Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes over the past 20 years, Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly threatened to earthquake. Under the Marmaramean Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatolic Disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth Plate.
One of the heaviest earthquakes was one of the strengths 7.6 near Istanbul in 1999. The epicenter was at the time in Gölcúk southeast of Istanbul, and more than 17,000 people were killed.
On Tuesday, a shake of strength 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul, and the authorities called on the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira appear in the half-time show
The Latin Pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will run the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. This announced the singers on Twitter. "It will not be larger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She is madly excited to stand on the Super Bowl stage in February 2 2020.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she dreamed of playing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at the time she saw Diana Ross flying to the sky at the mid-time show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina." She could hardly wait to show what we can do girls on the world's biggest stage."
Shakira said in a statement that she feels honoured to stand on one of the largest stages in the world and represent Latinos and Latinas from the United States and the world. "And then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time the two "kings" stand together on one stage.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against declining spectators
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcast in the United States. Even though spectators have recently dropped: this February, the spectacle has attracted the least spectators in the United States for more than ten years.
Around the half-time show of the past Super Bowl, there was a revolt in advance: in the dispute about dealing with Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, according to media reports last February, top stars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not appear. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the half-time show - the criticisms were little friendly.
Kaepernick, the quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, was no longer on the knees in the 2016/17 NFL games before the National Anthem of Protest against Police Violence and Racism. With his protest, Kaepernick didn't have a movement, many players took the gesture from March.
Cook-Pleit: Hotels Get Money From Insurance
Some banks are likely to be expensive, according to a press report, which threatens high deductions on outstanding bonds and loans. This is also affected by Credit Suisse, writes the "Financial Times" in its Friday issue.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would likely have to make a total of depreciations in their books of up to 1.8 billion UK pounds (about 2 billion euros), according to the report.
The creditors of bonds would have to buy deductions from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the lenders would have to buy between 550 and 825 million pounds, and the amounts that would actually be deducted would be more likely to be at the upper end of the bandwidths, an expert told the sheet.
For example, some 40 Thomas Cook's planes are "old" and many of the real estate are in poor positions. Most money could probably be removed with the sale of the airport slots, as well as the brand Thomas Cook.
Rackete took supposed killers to Italy
Sea Watch Captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who supposedly tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot exclude this but have no secure information about it," said Refugee Organization Sea-Watch spokesman Ruben Neubauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of raping, tortured, and killing people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the host camp in Italian Messina. New builders stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they left on their ships. "They come without passports."
Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa on 29 June, with a ship of the Italian financial police, and the three suspects were supposed to have arrived there on that day.
US warns federal government against Huawei
The head of the U.S. Internet Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the Federal Government not to trust the Chinese network equipment company Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too large," Pai told the "Handelsblatt" with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a “national safety law” that commits every company “under Chinese jurisdiction” to follow instructions by the security bodies.
The applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests,” said the FCC chief, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a "confidentiality declaration" from suppliers.
Berlin initially wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, the "Handelsblatt" reports on its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology is not only based on the hardware:
“The software is important to keep the devices up-to-date. This software consists of billions of rows of program code that change over time,” Pai said.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "no matter where, it would be able to check every single update in real time to track security risks," the FCC continues.
The Chinese Huawei Group is pushing close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The employee society, which allegedly belongs to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government,” Pai told the trade sheet.
Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to announce the position of the United States.
Chemical factory in Northern France burns: schools closed
In the night, a gigantic firewall illuminates the sky through a Northern French chemical factory. The fire is deleted after hours, but the cleaning work could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French town of Rouen on Thursday, schools and child crystals in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the institutions would not be opened on Friday, the competent prefecture told. The Ministry of Interior had urged the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to expose themselves to smoke. There were no injured. Farmers and growers were called to bring their animals inside, to protect their feed and to stop the harvest.
The fire could be completely deleted on Thursday night, as the prefecture reported. There was still a risk of the smell spreading after the deletion, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police officers were in use at the fireplace.
From the chemical factory, a giant black smoke column had previously risen. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the Lubrizol company’s factory, the oil supplement. The production facility is a few kilometers from the city center.
The factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous locations that are especially monitored. In the Italian Seveso in Milan, it came to a devastating chemical accident in 1976.
The prefect of Normandy, Pierre-André Durand, told the news broadcaster BFMTV that it was not first detected "high toxicity" in samples, but a pollution of the nearby Sein could not be excluded. In the river, stools were built against pollution, the prefectural statement said.
The fire broke out early in the morning at 02:40 a.m., the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear initially. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine river between Paris and Le Havre port town.
French Minister of Finance: "Germany must invest now"
France’s Minister of Economic and Finance Bruno Le Maire has called for greater investment in Germany to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany has to invest and now, the better the earlier," Le Maire said on Thursday night in the presentation of the French budget for the next year.
The economy in the eurozone is weak, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens to make the necessary decisions.”
These countries that have household spaces for more investment should have to act, Le Maire said, among other things, with regard to Germany.
France did not have these playspaces, the minister added and pointed out the high state debt of his country, which lies at more than 98% of the gross domestic product, and the French state debt must be "stabilised" and "lowered," said Le Maire.
In the last few years, Germany has repeatedly appealed to make more public investments to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly asked France to manage its budgetary deficit.
The French budget for 2020, presented Thursday, provides tax reliefs of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French government responds, among other things, to the protests of the yellow vest movement, which is expected to decline to 2.2 percent, according to expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson is a question about Brexit tactics
Britain’s Prime Minister Johnson criticizes the “capitol law” adopted by Parliament.
The Parliament is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a crackdown, but the Tory politician refrains from this possibility.
Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson holds covered whether he wants to enforce unregulated Brexit – despite the last legislation adopted by Parliament, which is precisely to prevent this, and on a question, Johnson only told journalists that his government will comply with applicable law.
The law provides that the government needs to apply for a displacement of the exit date should not be agreed with the EU until mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulating law" that makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
Former UK Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political shikans" to overcome the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural strike that will move the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit. Johnson said he seeks to leave a treaty with the European Union.
Johnson's Chief Advisor Dominic Cummings said in the meantime that he felt the political disputes about Brexit as a "walk in the park" and was confident that the intended EU exit is still happening: "We're enjoying this, we're going to win, we're going to exit at a time," the British Cumming said.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the 2016 election campaign before the EU referendum, now acts as a chief strategy in the UK headquarters of Downing Street and is intended to put behind the uncompromising policy that has led the Prime Minister into a seemingly flexible situation.
The Polaroid Diaries by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the great glamour. The photobook "The Polaroid Diaries" (pockets) dips deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 to Linda’s death in 1998, was clearly proud and stirred when he presented the band “The Polaroid Diaries” in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London mid-September.
According to the launch Event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a flightful look into the life of an exceptional family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a dedicated artist, and the immediate magic of the Polaroid movie."
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made her, some hundred of them are now published for the first time in The Polaroid Diaries.
There are portraits, still life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekov Eshun in his pre-word. And of course, one is always in the focus: her husband Paul - as you may have never seen him.
As he always dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, calls in a bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unshaped moonboats, surely the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but that had not been old on her farm in southern England or in Scotland.
Like hardly another medium, the poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than pure shots.
It's about the decision click: You must see if a great photo happens before you. And then you have to knit it at the exact right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you knit two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the gift to always take the right moment.
There is the light, the composition, the image cut and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but in addition to all anecdotics, it is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes appeared once as abstract years of painting.
“We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran.”
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from the neighbouring country despite US sanctions imposed against Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published Friday that Turkey could not stop import of oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he had participated in the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan, however, admitted that Turkey had problems with importing Iranian oil because some companies had “retreated from the US threats”.
Nevertheless, Turkey will “especially in this matter and in many other issues continue our relationships with Iran,” said the Turkish president, who had repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has pursued a policy of “maximum pressure” towards the Islamic Republic since its departure from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the US, Iran has secretly pursued a nuclear program and does not follow the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the breakdown of Iranian oil exports and a serious economic crisis in Iran, and tensions in the Gulf region have increased significantly in recent months.
U.S. government wants to restrict refugee receipt
The U.S. government wants to drastically restrict refugee receiving. The U.S. Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that the annual maximum limit of a resettlement programme is to be reduced from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which corresponds to a 40% increment.
The Department of Foreign Affairs said the US would continue to commit to support refugees, but the most important task is to protect and serve U.S. citizens, and the U.S. immigration system is currently overloaded.
In the future, the U.S. government wants to focus on the receipt of two groups of refugees: people who are persecuted because of their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and thus become at risk, as stated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
In the 1980 programme, refugees from UN warehouses worldwide are selected and relocated in the United States. The upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the budget year 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the program. Already the current upper limit of 30,000 is a lowest value. When the predecessor of U.S. President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the number of 8, the White House.
“This is a very sad day for America,” said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, which would further damage its leadership role in protecting the world’s most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to limit immigration to the United States – legal and illegal – strictly. The U.S. government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separately from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump: “Come close to a boss”
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused reporters in the whistleblower affair of the spy. Whoever reported the reporter who filed his power abuse, "is close to a lead," Trump said, according to a private event recording in New York on Thursday, which reports several US media agreeing.
When he was asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial things in the White House, he answered, "That's close to a crowd." Then Trump added, "Do you know what we've done in old times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayal, we cared for it until now."
The Democrats exerted sharp criticism of Trump's comments and intimidated witnesses. He also attempted to hinder a congress investigation on a possible proceedings of defence against him.
The whistleblower appeals to the President in a now published complaint of abusing his office in order to call for another country's intervention into the U.S. election 2020, and in particular, it is about his disputed phone call with his Ukrainian colleague of the president's phone call.
It is still unclear who the whistleblower himself and his informants are, however, as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower should be an analyst of the foreign intelligence service CIA.
Refugee boat: Baby and Children Drown in Aegean Sea
People are always trying to come across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece, often knowing too small boats regularly, and now seven migrants have died when a hose boat falls, including five children.
Before the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed during the death of a tube boat. Among the deaths were a baby and four other children, the Greek coast guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were therefore saved from the floods from the occupation of a passenger ferry.
Among the victims, the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr, reported. The migrants were left from Turkey in the morning, trying to reach the small island group of Inouses in the north-east of Chios Island, which lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
At the moment, hundreds of migrants from Turkey to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea, mostly in too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Assistance Plant (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route.
The Who Breaks Concert
A U.S. concert of The Who’s rock band found an ending because of a lead singer Roger Daltrey’s disruption. In the middle of the appearance on Wednesday evening in Houston, his voice failed the service. At the eighth song Daltrey told the audience, “I think I should leave it as long as it’s still running.”
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked for apology and supplemented that Daltrey could "now really not speak." The audience promised Townsend to come to his expense at a repayment concert, but an appointment is not yet fixed.
For Friday in Dallas and for Sunday in Denver, The Who said they will be retrieved at a later time. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old band colleague Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Hire suddenly stopped: WeWork Lets Real Estate Markets Shake
WeWork has become the largest office rental company in New York.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from the small startup to the driving force to the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in the crisis.
WeWork's crisis threatens to disrupt the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had discontinued Adam Neumann as a head of the founder a few days ago, moved the planned exchange trade from the office, and immediately stopped the sale of subsidiaries and values like the private jet for the Times.
WeWork rents large office areas in the long term and rent them in some small units of members in the short term. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. Until now, WeWork's new loss of money is expected to be the new loss of the company's new rent has grown to a breathtaking speed.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded rental agreements with up to 15 years of duration, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for the entire real estate markets.
According to calculations of the economist Dan Alpert from the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rent in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world.In the last 24 months, WeWork's new agreements ensuring that the demand for offices in New York was greater than that in this time.
Even in the UK’s capital, the balance on the real estate market could be notable without further expansion of the aggressive startup, among other things WeWork is the main rental company, in a last year purchased by the Sparkassen fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros in the center of the financial metropolis.
WeWork failed to make its business model profitable soon, the real estate owners would probably only have to decrease a portion of the expected billions of billions income. They have made access to the - however short - reserves of WeWork in the long-term rental contracts of the WeWork.
Russia once again captured numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian coastal guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen, and over the past few days there have been a total of 262 Wilders who had illegally fished into the waters, the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB said on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested, before the border defenders were shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injuries, he said. North Korea suffers from chronic food shortage.
The North Korean fishermen were travelling in Russian territorial waters, where the Russian coastal guards, according to their own information on the protection of their marine biological resources, patrols, and 30,000 ink fisheries were detected in the re-checks, as well as the three fishermen and two motor boats were captured, and after Nachodka and Posjet Wladiwok in 2018.
The Russian fisheries authority had also no fishing licenses issued to North Koreans, according to the complaints of local entrepreneurs, and thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been occasionally arrested in 2019.
The head of the Association of Russian fishing companies in the remote eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also accused of high environmental damage by North Korean fishermen. They fished with prohibited technical rules in Russia.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured during the prior week, and a North Korean wounded man died later, according to his injuries. On that 17 September, Russian border defenders initially set a North Korean boat and then a second after it opened the fire.
US imposes a ban on entry against former President Castro
The US has imposed prohibitions of entry against the former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The US Department of Foreign Affairs founded that in a statement on Thursday with Castro's participation in "grove human rights violations". As the head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean State, he is presenting a system in which thousands of Cubans willingly arrest and more than 100 political prison.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the dead revolutionary leader Fidel Castro was also co-violable by supporting the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, in violations of human rights there. "The disrespect of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Pompeo regime," the Venezuelan ministers, are responsible for the continueing crises of human right rights.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday pronounced prohibitions of entry among others against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela has been a bitter struggle between the government and the opposition for months. The U.S. has imposed a whole set of sanctions against Maduro's government to force him into the knees and force him to be the opposition leader and self-nominated president Juan.
Cuba is considered to be one of the closest allies of Maduro. The Socialist Caribbean Island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services sent to physicians. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government in the suppression of government opponents.
New Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands of people want to go on the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement plans once again to take action and demonstrations in dozens of countries worldwide, which is expected to begin due to the time shift of New Zealand and Australia until the protests move across Europe to North America.
"Last Friday, over four million people have striked for the climate. This Friday, we're doing it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, in the framework of the strike week, 6383 actions in 170 countries, she added.
Especially in Germany, the movement was very large last Friday. A good third of all global demonstrators - about 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities. This time, according to the movement, climates are planned to go on at least 65 cities such as Syreland.
At the age of 15, Thunberg set himself before the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call for politicians of their country to be more committed to climate protection. This resulted in Friday for Future movement within a short period of time. The climate protests are primarily involved in students and students, but increasingly also in scientists and other adults.
Together, they call for politics more ambitious in the fight against global warming and the threatening climate disaster, especially in accordance with the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial time.
Thunberg arrived in New York almost a month ago after a two-week transatlantic dirt with a high-sea race jacht, where she last participated in climate protests and United Nations summits, and on Monday she was addressed at the United Nations Nobel Prize, an emotional speech in which she was invasive for the Climate of the Earth.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
“This also applies to smoking,” said a spokesman of the Emergency Ministry in Moscow on Thursday of the agency Tass. The ban is to come into force on 1 October.
Those who smoke, therefore, have to expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42,46 euros). If the cigarette is to burn a fire, the punishment will be higher. The Ministry says that burning candles are equally burned. Even meat sparks on the balcony are no longer allowed.
Cybercriminals - Investigators lift servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time removed a large server provider for illegal businesses on the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspicious as the operator of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach at which Mosel hosted numerous websites through the internationally operating criminals.
This was reported by the Attorney General in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday night during a major action. The Darknet is a protected part of the Internet.
Suspect customers are expected to have been the operators of the world’s second-largest Darknet drug marketplace, “Wall Street Market”, which investigators had broken down in spring, and the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled via a cyber bunker server.
Such a host had been raised for the first time in Germany, said a web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
The access action with the support of special units such as the GSG9 has been searching in Germany and neighboring abroad, resulting from nearly five years of investigation and at lunch to inform the investigators about further details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands of people want to go on the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallying in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolitans such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Juchen in Northern Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
Climate protests <0xC7><0x80> Who are Thunberg’s hintermen?
Justice sense and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. The more amazing that except a 16-year-old girl keeps the nose to the power of this time. But what is behind it? Is it a helpfulness or a smart marketing of a climate activist?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg moves the masses and brings young people to rise for a better climate-friendly world. It is not the first time in Europe that a young man has created a collection of children and young people to win for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nicolaus from Cologne has elected to a share of the world, and it is not the first time.
But is there a shadowside in this regard? Why does it take a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? Furthermore, Greta Thunberg came a lot of rich PR managers at her side. In addition, her mother has not published a book, which has been sold widely, thanks to the daughter on the ramplight.
It is still authentic if certain circles of people work together with exchange makers during the World Rescue Action, and no matter what the ultimate position of the objectives of the discussion, a critical and reflective point of view is more and more important in a democratically characterized society.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A foreign comet currently crosses our solar system.
The assumptions of astronomers have confirmed: a foreign comet currently crosses our solar system – it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - Lang time researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet by another star is currently crossing our solar system. It has been baptized after his explorer 2I/Borisov and is currently employed by astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov in Crimea. He looked to heaven with a self-built telescope and other follow-ups confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that is not from our solar system. It is only the second of his kind watched during the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to grab insights into a foreign solar system. Obviously, the comet is similar to those of our own system, as the Canarian Astrophysical Institute reports. The comet is clearly interstellar, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC) and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbone that leads it out of our system.
Comet has been seen before approach - and can be observed several months
But before it comes so far, astronomers can watch it thoroughly, because unlike his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that it can be investigated from the Earth for many months. "The object will be reaching the greatest brightness of professional authority, and then will be larger to see it with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020."
The previous of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First insights about Comet 2I/Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the heavenly body seems to be similar to our comets - because as IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the sweating star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could be formed in our Jagem.
The observation goes beyond individual knowledge, however, that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Only recently, a giant asteroid passed through the Earth and came close to it dangerously.
"Absolutely Rejective": Rachel Johnson Shocked About Brother
Only his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister beats the prime’s warrior language as “tasteless” with clear words. It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Feed", Treaty": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to build up - at least verbally. At the questioning hour in the underhouse on Wednesday, the opposition was massively reluctant, and in the meantime more critics have been reported to word: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told the broadcast Sky News, her brother uses words such as capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit should be “hanged, hanged, long-shared, divided, fed and fed.” She thinks that is extremely distorted. She doesn’t recognize her brother’s version again, Rachel Johnsons said.
Especially her brother Jo Cox mentioned, a friendly EU-friendly sub-house MP, who had been killed by a neo-Nazi in 2016 a few days prior to the exit referendum. Her memory could be best honored by passing Brexit, Boris Johnson said in the underhouse, "It was very tasteless to draw itself to a member.
The widow of Cox also criticized the Prime Minister sharply. "It makes me sick when Jos's name is used so," he tweeted. The best way to honor it is if you are passionate and determined for what you believe in - no matter what one's thinking. But you can never be "demonized the other side of the attack."
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, set his office as the Secretary of State and his mandate as the Tory Deputy. "I have been torn between loyalty to family and national interest in the past few months - it's an unresolvable tension," Jo Johnson founded the step.
Johnson’s language has also been criticised in the church. As the “Times” reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that was “not worthy of this country” and in a common statement they explained, “In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside Parliament, should not be accepted.”
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez appear at Super Bowl
The NFL has a strong sign in the year of its 100-year-old existence: in the mid-term show of the coming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots appear, promising "an explosion of fun and energy."
Latina Power at the Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming US football league NFL final, which the organizers announced on Thursday (local time).
“I feel incredibly honoured and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the US,” Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will take place in Miami on 2 February. In the metropolis on the south-top of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl this time puts two women on stage - and two Latinas," explained Lopez. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. It promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy."
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents had emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later published songs in Spanish.
Shakira became known as a star of a telenovela and singer in Colombia. Her worldwide breakthrough was achieved in 2001 with her first two-language album and the single "Wherever, Wherever".
The announcement of half-time guests is expected in the US every time excitedly. This year, many also consider the choice as a political gesture. Finally, the country, not least by President Donald Trump’s immigration policy, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest U.S. sports event and at the same time a huge advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones provided Furore there.
Last year there were political controversy in advance. The reason was the dispute about the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused from protest against police violence against blacks, was raised during the playing of the national hymn, and for this, among many, was raised by U.S. President Donald Trump.
An actor and youtuber agrees to rule Egypt: First, Mohamed Ali prefers to remain abroad.
The two men who have influenced whether blood flows again on the streets of Egypt, both spent abroad last week. One of the two took back to Cairo airport. President of the state Abdelfattah al-Sifern said: "The president of the state hadn't lost the military in the Cairo airport. President of the state Abdelfattah al-Sifern said:
The president believes that the other man who currently determines the happening on the streets is trying to get away. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he removed the access of the security forces who would immediately arrest him when he tried to enter the Egyptian soil.
While the people are hungry, the president is hungry in luxury and build magnificent new palaces, he says. The army leadership, on which Sisi is based on his rule, at least just speaks the number of what Ali is explaining about. Because in his second profession as a builder, he seems to show what he has done for 15 years.
Last week, after the first time since Sisi's grip after the power had demonstrated thousands against his rule, and almost 2,000 citizens, among them prominent civil society figures, human rights prosecutors and opposition politicians, were arrested, this week, didn't call on the outpatch of the social media for this Friday.
From the town of Mansura in Nilbruten, where demonstrators broke in pieces banners with the portrait of the president, they were reported on Friday to have a massive police presence. Safety forces built checkpoints in the city and on the crash roads. In Cairo, several underground stations in the city centre were shut down the most of the roads.
Mohamed Ali led these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal doesn't have to be the tahir square," Ali said in Barcelona in his video camera. "Let's not meet with police officers," but as a retreat this is not to understand: "Egypt is the tahir square."
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options.
If you conclude an Internet contract, you don’t need to trust the speed indications of the providers. Customers can check themselves how much of it is actually achieved in case of accidents.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are a contract component and should therefore be achieved, explains the consumer center of Bavaria.
If the connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are different testing options, so the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them to the rate agreed in the contract.
“However, the testing of the suppliers is carried out according to the specific requirements of the supplier and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated,” the consumer center told Bavaria on its side.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of usually 14 days to produce the promised performance.
If this does not do anything, even after multiple requests, customers can cancel and may also demand damage compensation, but in the absence of success, only help the complaint.
First Ranking Republican for Investigation
"I think the investigation is important, yes, and where this leads from here is determined by the facts that can be taken," Phil Scott said at a press conference on Thursday.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky in a telephone call to investigate interventions of the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
Republicans have so far retained criticism of Trump because of the whistle blower affair; few have revealed discomfort. Scott's statements are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate republican, has already turned against Trump's politics several times, such as the relief of environmental protection laws and the hearing of armed legislation.
Spider-Man Remains in the MCU: More Marvel Movie Planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Hollands Spider-Man would no longer be part of the Avengers universe.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third movie within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home. This is a coincident with several US media reporting, and the movie will also be established: The film will be launched in the USA from July 16, 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant" Marvel Boos, Kevin Feige is quoted: "I'm happy that Spidey's path is going on in the MCU. I and all at Marvel studios are very happy that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in various universes as Sony will never work on his Spidey verse.
But what’s the sudden good news? Sony Marvel is supposed to have submitted an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney Group, including Marvel, would participate in the revenues of upcoming Spider-Man films with 30%. However, the message is not confirmed.
Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" final
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has arrived in the U.S. in the meantime at the big final. In the last consequence, there were many Happy End and so many Cameo performances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who has participated in the series for many years, has been tributed in a charming way.
Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a final farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some backgrounds once again showed the most memorable scenes with the present-day Duchess, such as the moments of the failed and happy wedding with Mike or how they greeted him after his seated prison.
But also her real husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned in the Suits final, of course, in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) just walks towards the altar to know about his fiancé Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), then doesn't actually make Harvey Specter a lot of answer about his.
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boat crash
A baby and four other children were drowned in a refugee boat in the Aegean Sea. In total, seven people died in the disaster, as the Greek coastal guard reported on Friday. Nationalities are still unclear.
The boat dropped near the Greek island of Inouses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland, and four children, three women and five men were able to be saved.
Last year, the United Nations Refugee Assistance Plant (UNHCR) reported that hundreds of migrants from Turkey were killed by the Greek islands in the east of the Egean Sea. The Federal Internal Minister Horst Seehofer announced that they would want to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, he would like to inform Turkey about how it is about the refugee situation, Seehofer said Friday, and then he would like to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens to help address the situation.
A spokesman of the EU Commission confirmed on Friday the planned Seehofer trip with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France’s Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, there are still unusually many migrants from Turkey, and on Tuesday alone, 654 people were transferred to the Greek islands, said the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Is the Turkish deal still working?
The increased figures later doubted the functioning of the 2016 EU-Turkey agreement, which provides that the EU can return all refugees and migrants who come illegally over Turkey to the Greek islands, in return, the EU wanted to receive a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian dismissed.
However, the processing of the applications for asylum is hard on the Greek side because of a lack of personnel. On Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, the Ministry of Civil Protection says, there are almost 29,400 people waiting. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: in a camp with capacity for 650 people, there are currently 5200 migrants.
Never ever since the EU’s Turkey refugee pact entered into force in March 2016, the state round radio reported.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart attacks
According to medical practitioners, climate change will be testing the health system in the future. Climate changes will be "entirely safe" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Cardiology Society.
Green Politician must be responsible for embarrassing photos
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Chef holds a multi-way cup in his hand on a photo, but now it came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained quite long unnoticed - and ultimately noticed. The reusable coffee cup with metal struggle, Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, has never been in hand. She was reported on the party's website on a picture with this cup, in conversation with citizens.
Green chief has to be responsible for photos
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the party produced Fake News in order to seem more credible in the topic of "Environmental Protection", and that in the middle of a voting campaign for the underhouse election, in which Trudeau has been increasingly difficult because of a rapish scandal.
The photo went viral to the social media and seek the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a counter-sharing of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their presidents to hide their one-way cup."
May was shocked and notes on her blog that she didn't know about this action. In order to underline this, she posted the original: she, in talking with citizens, had a cup in his hand. However, the one who put her right, was from bamboo. She has always seen it. A spokesman of the party said it wasn't on the site just about to put the party logo in the picture.
May writes that it suffers for the employee who did that. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian, and at the same time asked herself something from her overseen team: "If they want to edit a picture again, they couldn't do anything with my face so I look younger?"
The German Greens have also been advised because of their use of single plastics or their flight trips to shitstorms – however, their pictures were not footoshopped, so the chief of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate on vacation with plastic spoons, according to merkur.de*.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: lifelong flight ban at Cathay
Cathay Pacific claimed that Jaqueline Ng was upgraded by email, but when she asked for it when checking in, she did not allow her on board - and she should never fly with Cathay again.
Get spontaneously an upgrade for the Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and employees at check-in offer a free switch from the Economy Class.
This case, however, shows how to not do it: one explained influencer himself actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she returned from Taiwan to New York, and on June 7, she returned to New York.
On the departure flight, employees Jaqueline refused to upgrade, although she presented an email in which her Cathay Pacific allegedly provided an upgrade. The writing wants to receive the influencer from an airline’s marketing employee, while the airline accused Jaqueline of falsified mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-distance flight. This time, the woman supposed to have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The staff at the JFK airport were skeptical: they hacked at the headquarters. And in fact, the employee from whom the mail supposedly comes does not have confirmed the mail contact with Jaqueline.
The airline employees at the airport cancelled Jaqueline’s ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (about $1,280) she had to buy a new flight tick to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests, because while Cathay had refunded her the price for her original ticket, Jaqueline also requested the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: for Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains blocked for future flights. The terms and conditions of the airline also state that they don’t have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with it - and now has an attorney.
Oil prices reported on fire arrest in Yemen
Oil prices dropped in the shortest time on Friday morning by more than one dollar. Last one barrel (159 liters) of North Sea Brent cost $61.83 - about 1.4% less than earlier day. The price for a barrel of the American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rate dropped by 1.3% to $55.77.
It was a report from the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen that Saudi Arabia is supposed to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had brought five percent of the world’s oil production to the middle of September. Huthi rebels allied with Iran in the Civil War Yemen had claimed the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the U.S. government, is responsible for Iran.
If an agreement actually comes, you can focus on growth and demand management, said Ole Hansen, head of the Saxo Bank’s raw material strategy department at Bloomberg News Agency.
The oil prices continued its downward movement in the past few days. A week ago, a WTI barrel oil had cost up to almost $59, Brent almost $65.
Lastly, Bloomberg reported that repair works on oil plants in Saudi Arabia go faster than expected after the attack in mid-September, thus the volume of production reaches a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved back towards the original amount.
Lastly, there were multiple press releases calling for insiders who reported the rapid progress of the state oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work, but raw material experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning to avoid a stock exchange and negative headlines.
At the same time, some relaxation was suggested in the conflict between Iran and western countries: the British oil tank "Stena Impero" is more than two months after Iran's arrest and the recent release on the way to leave the port.
However, the US announced to move defense rockets and soldiers to Saudi Arabia into Iranian arch enemy, fear of escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and Britain had occasionally significantly increased oil prices over the past few weeks.
Accusations against Trump exacerbate
In the affair about possible abuse of power by President Donald Trump, charges of crackdown against the White House have become loud. Several leading government employees would have strived to have a controversial phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky said to prevent the reply of the talk at the end of July.
North Korea says the third summit of Trump and Kim is questionable
North Korea has doubted that in the nuclear dispute will soon come to a third summit of rulers Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump, and the sense and prospects of success of such a meeting were questionable due to lack of progress in implementing agreements on the first Summit in Singapore, Chief Diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday.
The U.S. had not done anything to implement the decisions of the Summit last year, the adviser of the North Korean Foreign Ministry said. He also criticized US sanctions and the US and South Korea’s common military manoeuvres, but he hoped Trump’s “wise” and “courageous” decision to come back to an approach.
Trump had said on Monday that he would first know what a third summit with Kim should be bringing before he was prepared to explain it. The negotiations on a dearm of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have come to the dearm since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in February, but they agreed with the two states in Hanoi.

In view of the goal of getting Angola mine-free countries, he called on the later television.
Pounds under pressure - expected rate reduction
British pounds under pressure
In view of a soon rate reduction, the pound loses value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt speculation on a soon rate decrease of the Bank of England (BoE) contributes to the Pound Sterling. The British currency bound up to 0.4% on Friday to $1.2269.
This statement was surprising, as Saunders said as a defendant of a restrictive monetary policy, today's brother-in-laws said, "Active" is a surprising statement, as Saunders said as a defendant of a restrictive monetary policy.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy by the Brexit Hickhack without directly signaling a rate reduction. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU if necessary, even without a divorce agreement on October 31.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay for him, said Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian Manipulation Proved
Material from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory is manipulated – this confirms David Howman, ancient director of the World Antidoping Agency (Wada) and today’s Head of Integrity of the World Athletics Association.
New details of the doping scandal in Russia appear at the start of the World Athletics World Cup - and they destroy the few credibility of what Russian sports had won back at the beginning of the year and even only in an approach. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015.
In December 2014, the Wada had blocked the Russian Antidoping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During that time, the Russian athletes were not completely banned from the World Cup in the Russian sports stage. The International Olympic Committee took part in the winter competition at the summer matches in Rio, after individual exam in February 2016, roughly 270 athletes in the country.
Positive findings are missing
In the following September, the Wada resumed the Rusada bank, but called for access to the laboratory and the samples. The data should provide information about the extent of the doping cases during state doping. They should help athletes be punished afterwards. Three months later they were finally delivered.
Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Leichtathletics World Association (IAAF), however, has now confirmed that the doping data were manipulated from the Moscow analysis laboratory. "Yes. We have mentioned the many data that were positive nine months ago. We should check if the task force has received the right data between the January"
The World Cup is not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: the light athletics association holds as the only organization at the ban of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes launch under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they work outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada manipulations had already placed in space and urged Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia now threatens the re-blocking of the Rusada and, in the worst case, also the exclusion of the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
