28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef, who has recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre.
The brother of the sacrifice said he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm him, "Eventually it went up with him again."
The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday tomorrow was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the court medical department told San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that the death was classified as a murder and the investigations are running.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS broadcast KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a cook in Boston, had earned his dream job as a cook at the Sons & Daughters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
One spokesman of the Son & Daughter said they were “shocked and destroyed on the ground” about his death.
“We’re a small team working like a close family and we’ll miss him painfully,” said the spokesman.
Our thoughts and compassion are in this difficult time with Frank’s family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was living in hostels first, but that "things went up for him finally."
“He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend,” Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a great heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook a little bit, prepare dinner,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation.
He was the brother who swims with the current.
"At all that is going wrong in the world, he was this unflamed diamond that shines brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SFPD's notice phone at number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn’t always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has made this clear in an interview.
“I’m always put in drawers or getting stick from outside labels that usually have little to do with me and reality.”
“I don’t have the desire to always be perfect and successful.”
"Honestly, these things are rather snuffy to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
Indeed, the actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of television with loose dut and Mexican food, it says in the magazine.
“We don’t have to be married or have children to be perfect,” said the Hollywood star.
In her new movie "Mother's Day - Love is not a child game" Aniston is seen as a single-parent mother of two sons.
The film will be running with us from August 25.
Golfer Langer gets the sports pyramid
His experience on the horse is overviewable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a little difference with a ride on the beach.
For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their evening, they hunted home to the feed bars in the fast gallop.
One mile at that pace, I was afraid.
“It wasn’t a good experience,” Langer says.
And then the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfers of all time - 101 tournament seasons - was back near horses.
He led himself with his family over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he didn’t even sweep for photo purposes.
Langer was the first time in Aachen and therefore in Chio.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid provided the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sports Pyramid as part of a small gala.
There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic athlete.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the Year...
Even the British Queen has already added him.
Longer is the 18th award winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen, he met the first Hans Günter Winkler prize winner on Saturday.
“This award means a lot to me,” Langer says, “because it will be awarded not only for sporty successes, but also for social commitment.”
For decades longer has promoted the childhood.
He also gave the prize of 25,000 euros right away.
With another 15 outstanding athletes, the twice US master winner was taken into the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
These include the light athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, Turner Eberhard Gienger, Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, Ruder Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Driver Meinhard Nehmer, Judoka Frank Wieneke and the Springer Alwinhemmball Schock.
Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company moved to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer stood away from the great animals.
Clinton's and Trump's economic policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP’s trading agreement – that’s what Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two U.S. presidential candidates are unconsistent in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
He is about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep them rather small in doubt and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.
In contrast, he himself would be quite different, Trump says.
He’s going to bring regulations back massively, and makes it strong for a widespread tax reform with lower tax rates – for private people and for businesses.
On the other hand, Clinton says that the state has certain tasks to fulfill, has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money for it.
That’s why taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both of them are very close to the topic of infrastructure.
They need to be invested in, Trump and Clinton say almost equal.
The democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state critical tea party flights of the Republicans.
Therefore, Trump could still be in-party discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal plants and upgrade coal promotion in the United States.
Oil promotion is intended to be possible even in protected areas to date, and the Paris Climate Agreement will be announced.
On the other hand, Clinton wants to expand renewable energy with its investment program, calling for: "A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
“It will probably be either China, Germany or America – I want us to be it.”
However, not only with infrastructure – even with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, do not want to sign both.
At the same time, both of the United States do not want to isolate from international trade, but just protect American jobs better.
They should be paid better, for example, Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
He wants to raise him to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do in this matter is not clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be up, then he says he cannot be changed.
However, the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump is seeking to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.
His critics agree to him so that the budget deficit would only be even greater.
On the other hand, Clinton is, who at least wants the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say, more taxes are not the solution either.
Evening: “Every fleeing woman has experiences with sexual violence”
Sexual violence belongs almost to everyday life for women who flee alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
In a large kitchen, four women are sitting.
Each of them has a baby who is at least one year old.
One put her little son in his arm.
He looks curiously in the room with large eyes.
His mother looks at the table.
Until she realizes that she is observed.
She smiles briefly and kiss the little one.
The scene works normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is a business leader of Condrobs, a supporter for social aid offers in Bavaria, and, among other things, deals with women fleeing.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for all-influenced women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Assistance.
It was officially opened recently.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men, not as a visitor.
The exception is a guard at the door.
"It's not overwhelmed to say: Every woman who comes here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape," Bahr said.
“Men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them as a hopeholder to Europe,” she says.
In women, other reasons for the escape are overwhelming: "Many steal themselves secretly because they don't see any other way to escape."
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, compulsory eyes, honour killings, slavery or compulsory prostitution.
That's going on her.
This is going on on the escape.
“That trailer, for example, calls for a bottle of water for a sexual act is not rarity,” says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Whoever believes that the end, as soon as they are wrong in Germany, tells Bahr.
Women who stand alone in refugee accommodation would often be seen as low-quality and in the worst case abused.
It estimates that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the northern Munich are traumatized.
“Some of the children are certainly not voluntarily created.”
Many women are used to say nothing.
“Or they don’t trust to talk openly about what they experienced because the shame is too big.”
Because they often don’t know to help themselves, it needs more accommodation just for them, Bahr asks.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
Asked if they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some respond with no.
For example, there is no such thing in the Upper Pfalz and Oberfranken accommodation of governments.
Even in Switzerland, alone fleeed women are not housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, government press spokesman.
In Upper Bavaria, lower and middle-frances, there are in some community accommodation floors or homes only for alone women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
In a study published for the committee, “It is very important that men and women be hosted separately.”
“If privacy is missing or men and women are housed together, violence against women can occur – persistently.”
Especially the laundry rooms should be separate and easily accessible to women, the study states.
How much the women feel this protection need can be read on the andrang there is on the house in Munich.
“Since it has spoken about that we are there, we have a long waiting list,” Bahr says.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant physicians strike: demands for new workfighting measures
Assistant physicians have asked their union to approve new workfighting measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has asked its entire council to approve more workfighting measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that ministers would not have taken care of the concerns regarding the contract.
Assistant physicians and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA in July.
He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC Chairman Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently calm" to problems, leading to the denial of the contract.
She said, “In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to fully refuse the proposed new contract and requested official renegotiations to all your concerns.”
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Executive Board today has filed a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a ongoing programme of escalating workfighting measures that begin in early September.
The disputes led to that assistants strike six times this year, the first overall failures in the history of the NHS.
Dr. Johann Malawana, Head of BMA Assistant Physicians, returned after the election to refuse the agreed terms of contract, which were recommended by the BMA.
He announced BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students, that the contract should be advantageous and accepted.
After the vote, minister of health, Jeremy Hunt, said the contract for doctors would be introduced in England.
Russia and Turkey: A "Alliance of Outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and announce an official war of words and economic sanctions lasting for the end of the eight months.
But when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish counter-player in the golden hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the hand hit, yes.
But Putin’s smile looked narrow lip and he had hardly radiated heat, even for his retaining conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his “loving friend” Putin – according to a report five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relationships with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have taken itself as if anything bad had never happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.
But one of Putin’s sustainable cooling showed that Russia’s head of state had nothing forgotten.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow’s reaction at that time was furiously burned.
Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen Russia in his back.
The crime was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding trust will be difficult, if not even impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unlimited attack on Ankara.
At once it seemed like the Turks would bear the fault for everything.
The most serious was the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria’s areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He disputed this heavily.
But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting was only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to win some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was unfolded last month in a failed state strike.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have stripped Turkey hard, especially prohibiting charter flights, which usually bring millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be easier when flights are restarted.
They rely on a late seasonal turmoil on the Mediterranean.
This week, the state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry on the West because it considers its response to the attempted overtake of power as a weak response.
To this end, the continued angry over the pace of accession to the EU negotiations and Putin – which is calling on to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.
The Russian head of state was surely won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for the elected government bodies after the tried strike.
This is a properly obvious for Moscow, which even has a deeply seated fear of regimes changes.
The summit in this brilliant palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, one, as an analyst once described me, to represent "Alliance of Outsiders": two countries that feel violated and treated badly from the West and now allied.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played as peacekeepers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents at the press conference said they had not even stripped the issue.
The President of Turkey intentionally declined to answer a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common namer can be found for Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for a perfect disaster when the NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads at least speak again to each other.
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside Scotland
According to the Bank’s Chief Executive Board, the RBS brand is intended to only be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has been distant since when it had to collapse and be saved almost eight years ago.
During this time, trademark strategies "RBS" have used to protect other end consumer financial brands.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and exchange ratings will switch to NatWest.
The brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the private customer business that will gain more significance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we now become more a brand bank.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to develop into the brand bank, because how we focus inside (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers,” said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves its 3000th win at Newmarket at Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured its 3000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on Predilection, trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reaches the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I’m very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I am easier and very modest.
Dettori takes the joy when he wins on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the mileage in the obstacle race – Jockey Richard Johnson and the 20-time retired winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4,300 victories in a record career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time derby winner, had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockey in modernity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma has been enthusiastic for fans for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already won 6,000 winnings if he wasn’t just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has ran almost 30 years winners in GB, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but besides, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying dismount
From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the shield of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of major tournament winnings, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an aircraft crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had difficulties at the beginning when he returned from his six months old lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to challenge and return to his best form.
And he's not yet at the end - Dettori once said he wants to continue in competitions until his at least 50 years of age.
Putin fired Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was a part of Putin’s closest confidence circle for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
In a statement by the Kremlin, Putin “has ordered Ivanov’s dismissal from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidency.”
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov’s deputy since 2012, has been appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated at the renowned Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin’s website, he says (in Russian) that he was later Protocol Manager and Staff Manager of the Government staff.
About his appointment, he told Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a head of state in terms of legislation drafts and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told Russian television channel on Friday that Ivanov asked him to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do you convince the smiling faces?
This step has taken Moscow mystery.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest confidents and works like he worked for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
He was one of the most powerful men in the country.
During a meeting with President Putin broadcast on television, both men claimed that the head of the Staff resigned on their own wish.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced here - especially now, just before parliamentary elections.
So is the result of a sort of power struggle here?
No one knows this currently.
But the official claim - that a man once acclaimed as a potential president once wanted to lead Russian environmental policy - found great skepsis.
In his comments on Putin, cited on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "it's true that I asked you in a conversation early in 2012 to trust this very complicated post - one could almost tell me - for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidency for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
He was deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to be his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he most trusted.
It was once believed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term had violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another nearby ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved in a physical contest last month at the Los Angeles series set.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, producing the series, announced his termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologised publicly on Thursday before announcement of his discontinuation.
At the set there were artistic differences and differences.
I regret the incident,” he said in a message.
Details of how the character Gibsons from the series, following a team of FBI agents, are expected to be published later, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my entire heart blood in the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but this will no longer be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned release of the twelfth season is set on September 28.
Puzzles about fish landed in garden in Banff
An inhabitant of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandales that were expelled from a spring fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct – which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blowers", which approaches the finish around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 ropes.
The £1.35 billion expensive project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economics, Keith Brown, visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said, “This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses to an engineering art of a truly epic measurement in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerance for the fit.
Overall, nearly 79% of the entire bridge decks are on their place and the last section of the deck today in Rosyth gets a concrete mouth for the deck, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure is a significant milestone for each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents up-to-date high and deep construction.
After the installation of the last road deck and its connection to the North Tower deck in the expansion, we then had to close the still existing gap on the northern or land side.
This was reached by dragging the northern bridge 700 mm south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massively, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs approximately 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a climb of approximately 3%.
Heikel, since the tolerances the team worked on were small - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three Men Have Happiness to Be Alive
Three men have "happiness to be alive" after they were thrown from their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station hit on Friday at 13:20 BST alarm after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had trouble swimming safely while their boat continued to move with their own power.
“We saw the boat rotating around them and presenting us the worst,” said Moelfre Vince Jones, head of the rescue station.
“Fortunately, the strong winds have already weighed the boat outside their reach until we left water,” he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a Boje without a rescue jacket.
They all came on board the coastal rescue boat and were returned to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said, “The three men who were thrown into the water have happiness uninjured and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stoppies, it removed the person who controlled the boat when the boat was ketting.
Someone was watching these men today.
Heavy hurt - Man sticks to his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and injured heavily.
As police said yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholized perpetrator cut off his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When she came into the apartment, he stacked her twice.
The 44-year-old was wounded in the hand and the body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
As the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
She then alarmed her sister.
Together with her lifemate, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother.
But she couldn’t move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her colleague.
On the road, they met the man's former living companion.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old shot his sister and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and Greens think that investors will be taken into account much more in future.
How to respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,300 low-cost apartments in the coming years?
The SPD suggests for the next Council meeting a "habitation concept".
But dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is: Who should actually build the cheap apartments?
There is no regulation so far.
Chairman of the SPD, Christoph Bratmann, said: “We agree with the Greens: whoever wants to build on urban areas will have to exhibit 20 percent of all housing as social housings in the future.”
Favourable apartments can also arise in stock.
However, the big point of dispute in the town hall is, says Bratmann: "How do you work with investors who want to build on private areas?"
“We want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as possible 20 percent of housing as social housing.”
A new urban housing funding program that will cost millions and needs to be funded is to provide incentives.
The problem, said Bratmann, “There is no agreement between the groups yet.”
The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.
The left will still want tough requirements for investors.
Despite this, Bratmann says, an exacerbation of the situation on the housing market has been developed.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff are needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the professionals.
However, the program is not complete: because the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built anyway.
But how do you equal the loss of some 1,300 other low-cost apartments whose funding will expire in the coming years?
By 2020, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, spokesman for planning policy, Nicole Palm, should now be purchased by the city.
In addition, it should be thought of bringing apartments back to the price liaison.
This is possible in the western town.
At one point, the problem could be solved.
In the western town, deadlines are running at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price attachment for cheap apartments.
Only: that's not the owners, the housing companies.
Because the number of social apartments in the west town is drastically increased again, away from the goal of so-called mixing.
There is no longer a concentration of social weaknesses in a few districts.
The Greens hope that there will be still movement in the discussion.
Chairman Holger Herlitschke said, “For a wide majority, the CDU has to go into the boat.”
It focused on more building sites for single-family houses.
But what doesn’t mean that we can’t find a compromise yet.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile
It’s fascinating to see how the world changes.
That teenager and child no longer go out to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time watching on screens, have been complained by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games, and lastly to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.
I’m of course referring to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990s (a series of characters, game cards and other spin-offs were later created from it).
As many phenomena of pop culture interest dropped before the release of the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The launch in other countries was displaced by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and can be "photographed" (over a screenshot on the phone) or "printed" once they were found.
A generation that played the game when she was even younger, joined the madness and leaped for the search for the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that decreased the "average" person every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracked 35,000 users, recently reported that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of tracked people who trained 30 minutes each day started from 45% to 53%.
The company doesn’t know who plays Pokémon Go – it only sees the raw data for enhancing performance.
Many public education campaigns to health that want people to “take 30 minutes of time,” “come from sofa” and “be active every day” came to deaf ears because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overassessed.
Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that makes them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships on hunting.
As usual, there are destroyed players who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's it?
It happened a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to sport as this game does.
The new thing will lose its enthusiasm and the use will decrease with time.
Due to Pokemon’s success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with getting active in the real world, helping many people hunting to be more active, more fitted and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in women's tournaments
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump horse.
Easy on the beam.
Breathtaking on the ground.
Overall brilliant.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American turner turned on Thursday to a multi-fighting title and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the eyes of all under the lightlight of the Olympic Games.
Their total outcome of 62,198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American girls Simone Biles turn on the swivel beam during the single women’s multi-fight final at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Games, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-competition title and the fifth overall, while strengthening her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her end result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment.
This success puts her in the same league as unique athletes as Michael Phelps, who brought her sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sports for the last three years, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton told her that she is "the best turner I've ever seen."
She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of over-sized expectations.
Not returning to the family with a handful of gold in Spring, Texas would be seen as disappointment.
The American girls Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman, embrace themselves after winning gold and silver in the single women’s multi-game finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi served as a sign.
Although Biles insisted on never planning the future during their long path to the top, this isn’t true.
Part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical tumbling pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a young child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym in which Boorman trained, became a force.
Since the summer of 2013, she has no longer lost a multi-competition competition, a victory series that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even if mustafina led easily through two rotations, the picture deceived.
Swivel beams and floor turns - in which Biles holds the world championship title - lauren.
She recovered with 15,433 on the hollow beam - and laid with a 15,933 on the floor another on it.
Raisman gently embraced her when they awaited her endgear - a pure formality - and tears flowed on biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, than the vision she once described in her collective book became reality.
Raisman’s performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went in a tiebrake on Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain called the Americans Grandma had a lead.
After her ground exercise she threw hands to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful.
As for Biles, the quickly spreading 19-year-old tweet has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week:
Police: 3 victims killed in serial assassination while listening to music in the car
According to police reports published Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot in one of the most deadly attacks in the first serial killer case of Phoenix for a decade as they were talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in an entry, the authorities said.
The perpetrator shot eight shots from a handfire gun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fleeing with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.
The police reported that the threefold murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 in possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix's police spokesman Jonathan Howard said the shooting was leading the investigators to get a closer look at whether they are associated with four previous attacks.
Overall, seven people were killed in four months in nine attacks and two more were injured in Spanish residential areas.
“It happens in a residential area in front of a house,” said Howard of the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, early this month.
It is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to reveal the evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on site.
One witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder, and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine space.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But like the least of his fellow fellows, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto didn’t know about during her pregnancy.
When he came home for the first time, my first thought was that I didn’t.
I can't do that.
I didn't get into it.
What’s not right at all – of course, you’ve got into it,” she said.
Her husband Vincent and her have been informed that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institutionalize him.
"My first answer was, 'I didn't know that people still do," Picciuto said.
Edmund can run with a walk help.
Edmund could not sit or crawl until his third age and he still cannot speak.
But he makes progress slowly.
It can run with support and cycling.
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund thought of “Please sing a little for me.”
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund has invented some signs alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as with Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as mice or zikavirus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and forecasts can vary significantly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an unknown future.
I always asked what will happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven’t asked for forecast for a long time, because I don’t expect someone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by zikavirus.
It's going better.
You know it will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfall, flooding gives a chance to rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfall and large floods in Louisiana forced the Governor to announce the emergency on Friday, which is expected to have more rainfall throughout the entire Saturday.
Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large floods after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that help is already on the road to the affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that the demands for flooding vehicles, boats and sandbags are increasing.
Steele said that alone the municipality of Tangipahoa would have requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is used over large parts in South Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service indicated that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
In the south of Alabama, a flood spring warning system was used on Friday while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both of which are located in Louisiana, will most likely reach record levels over the weekend.
Meteologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger as these rivers will only slowly flow into the Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi State Border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 9.00 a.m.
Rescue teams still cast people from the flood water into the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and step son were among those who were saved near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rises strongly overnight.
He said another step son who lived nearby would have warned him.
“We woke up and the water flowed and flowed in,” Hansford said.
It reached my size.
His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said he and his family members had all disability and he was the only one to swim.
Hansford said that all three emergency helpers had saved them in a large military truck and brought them to the next firewall in Gloster, where they were placed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flood had "speedly spread" because there was still heavy rainfall and that the authorities would hesitate to consider evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday tomorrow from 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said that the soil has been significantly fuelled since Wednesday by the rainfall.
The authorities said heavy rainfall and road floods caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and failure of teaching in five school circles.
The CBS daughter station WWL reported that a member in Tangipahoa indicated 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, both of which were now flooded.
Robby Miller said the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets washed by flooding.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodations were established to accommodate the evacuated.
"Once the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In Hammond, Tangipahoa municipality, almost two dozen streets were closed due to flooding and sand bags were provided to the residents who hope to be able to keep the water from their homes and shops.
“The last big flood we had was in March,” Lacy Landrum said.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it continued to rain on the Golf Coast.
According to his report, a handful of houses are reported as flooded on Thursday, but no reports have been reported on Friday until now.
Keith Townson, Manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places I’ve never seen it before,” Townson said, “and it’s still coming.”
Mahaj Brown, 6, "holed through balls," survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week the second time a 6-year-old child was shot.
The grandparents of the boy identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents said that Brown suffered several shooting injuries, including in the lend, leg, arm and stomach, but that he was conscious during his transport to the hospital.
"He has gone through a lot, his little body was holed through balls," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the broadcast.
I just can't believe that.
The condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the broadcaster that he's expected to recover again.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in a critical condition; the other two victims, according to CBS Philadelphia, are in a stable condition.
The boy was shot at the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old who is in a critical condition, the broadcaster reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police just determined whether they could be among one of the injured men of the perpetrators.
The investigator told CBS Philadelphia that it appears to have come to a cross fire between several shooters.
Cartridge sleeves for storm guns tracked back to various storm guns overseated the crime site.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the walk, were sleeves.
So there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved here,” police officer Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles have also been hit in the area.
There were no arrests and the police currently reviewed the monitoring video according to reports.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a cross-roller on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She is recovered and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is what I imagine among the Women’s Olympic team in the tournament and for more than one reason.
First, I’ve been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three turners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who looked inspiring for many young girls of other skin colors.
The structure of this team, Aly Raisman, Jewish and Madison Kocian, Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has strengthened the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among the female turners was an African American woman.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
In the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America.
Now the world was able to be a witness to the incredible performance of three-time champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but mastery gym routine.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual multi-fighting event for women.
Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the top of this sport, but so doesn’t turn classes all over the country look like.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all went the same way as Aly and Madison to create it to the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will only have four tournaments in the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.
But the reality looks like Turner is an expensive sport and Turner primarily in private tourn clubs maintained by parents that come up for training, furniture, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their turners and families) and the list can be continued as a desired one.
The majority of these tour clubs are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, turners get their entire training and this is a costly and long-term commitment for families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer by Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer by Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes since they started the tournament.
We have to enable the communities to provide a more leasible and easily accessible tournament training, even countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my 20-year-old tournament.
At my events, we offered free and affordable tournaments in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international victories.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer youth high-quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turns develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the spirit.
This combination offers lifelong health benefits as well as educational and professional success.
It’s the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in the tournament and that’s great.
It is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.
This is so exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic Team Gold and thank her for motivating her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hunt’s proposal
The ministers had hoped to be able to terminate the dispute about the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association officials, but 58% of the 37,000 assistants who voted on elections rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to compulsively introduce the contract and said that the NHS would find itself in a “nobody country” and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first assistant physicians are expected to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at unfavourable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Physicians, said last night in a statement: "Assistants have still been serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will heat the current occupational crisis and avoid treating all doctors fairly."
Only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time is expired.
Efforts by the BMA to solve the disputes through talks met with the government to participate in rejection and sometimes silence.
This happened by a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, remove the force and address the concerns of assistant doctors."
If he does not do this, the assistants have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further workfighting measures.
The last strike at the end of April saw a decline of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved to give doctors coverage on the strike chain.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by adopting the reformed treaty with the British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants a better weekly pay for the 54,000 assistants who are subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS employees, urged assistants to end the strike.
Mortimer said, “No workfighting measures achieve little but burdened teams and service providers and prepare patients, caregivers and their families only concerns, trouble and interruption.”
In the last two months, we talked to the Assistant Doctors’ Committee and answered positively with the Ministry of Health and other ministries to concerns about care and whistleblowing.
The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as sending, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional time, training codes, mutual recognition of the curriculum, continuing education leave, and gender-specific wage cases in medicine - were a sign of the seriousness of the employers with the ministers of Health and Health England.
The £2 per day drug that can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day medication after authorities have been recommended to give this more people for a longer period of time.
The anti-coagulation drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS regulatory authority NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS regulatory authority NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year, and one-quarters of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fat-containing materials in the artery walls that form loads.
When the coating breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that shuts blood flow to the heart and thus causes a heart attack.
When the blood cloth dissolves, it can flow through the blood flow and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and is distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
NICE’s draft guide, which has been published today, recommends a 12-month ticagrelor intake of 90mg, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack have had another heart attack or stroke – often with disastrous consequences.”
Fear of a re-heart attack may have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the effectiveness and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correctness Lets Election Fraud Blossom in Muslim Areas
Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the start of a government report for corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is consciously ignored, as a devastating government report today has revealed.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks police, electoral observers and councils for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to “hypersensitivity to ethnic and religion.”
The former minister of integration and municipal government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up lockbands outside of electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters carry an identity card with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter has to just name his name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person’s fingers when they give their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.
“This is not only for election fraud, but also for the municipal government to protect against the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that follows it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in the east of London.
Last year, a special election court decided that Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be launched after a litanei of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The court found that Rahman had "perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical manner" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman said “has led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him.”
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of a imitation in which one person chooses than someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
In particular, he expressed an alarming alarm on the fraudulent letter election - in which the elderly members of the Muslim community had pressured people to choose a candidate for their election.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the election system, including leading proofs to prove identity.
In his report, it says, "As evidence, pressure has been exercised on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, particularly communities with Pakistani or Bangladesh background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions have ignored such a behaviour due to 'politically correct' hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric expressed 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the ban on political activists to edit letter-election documents to stop "electors".
The report considered by Theresa May also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the voting directory from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your identity card before choosing.
Use non-removable ink on a person’s finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
A three-year limit on applications for an automatic letter selection.
Forbid politicians to edit full letter elections and encircles of letter elections.
The police will give the authority to set up lockdowns for election stations.
An amendment to the law facilitates an accusation of intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Volksvertretungs Act 1983).
Prohibition of photographing in election stations.
Requirement that only English can be used in the election stations (except Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees implement the rule that voters go to the electoral cabin alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "surprising" that after the Tower Hamlets case no criminal charge was filed.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy to be inadequate due to a litanei of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was acknowledged guilty due to a number of reasons for sufficiently - in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "abhak controls" of the electoral registration departments of the Councils.
Sir Eric said, “The last year’s court judgment in Tower Hamlets was a warning signal.
Our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, but the concerning and hidden spread of voting fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy for Kates Radler's Double Pedestrian and other famous Double Pedestrians of Olympics athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have gone outside this week from the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, which has proved to be an impressive duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympics is not far the only athlete fighting for gold this summer, who has his own famous double-people - at least not if you can believe social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that currently float on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than just a similarity with Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and Wolf: U.S. team member in the bow shooting Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Besides Kate's double-trainer on the bike railway, many people on the internet pointed out how a certain bow sniper could be the twin of A-promise Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. team member Brady Ellison caused an assault on Twitter after pictures he appeared unbelievably similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star.
In fact, the bow sniper got the madness on social media and admitted that he has already heard that he looks like Leo since his childhood.
“I don’t see great similarity myself, except face hair,” Brady said at Huffington Post.
“He’s a good-looking guy, so I’m supposed to think of this as a compliment.”
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly focus this year even more: the accidental similarity between British widespread jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian turner Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, is supposed to be able to pass through as a double singer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
This user believes Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor.
Another lasting comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than just the sun-brown skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while the American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very happy that others noticed similarities too
Theory put in space: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that “the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical.”
In fact, U.S. football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, almost identical to the actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in the turn Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, broad smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commenter for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "as a pig has died"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at the 4x200m freestyle swimming staffel of the CBC live transmission of the Olmypian Games on Wednesday
The Canadian broadcast CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "as Mief was gone" and during the race like "a pig died."
Byron MacDonald's thought his microphone was turned off when at the end of the 4x200m free style swimming pool he made his own opinions.
MacDonald, who had been brought to the CBS’s commentators team on board to give more "color", could be heard saying, "This 14-year-old Chinese little girl has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, gone like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for it.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swimming the second stage of the swimming potato 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canadians to close the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, “Has the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China “has died like a pig?”???
The stupid didn’t realize that they were still on ship.”
Ai Yanhan from China was described as follows at the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming pool for women: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Critics against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, in which many talked about him
Twitter users didn’t stop when they heard how unsensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: “Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and makes us all look like racists.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC, apologised live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize for the comment on a swim performance was broadcast."
It was an unfortunate elected formulation, we're sorry that it happened."
CBC finally apologize for more than 90 times to people who answered the comment on Twitter
Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained of MacDonald's comments
The network also apologised quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to be broadcast.
Yesterday night we apologize quickly to our spectators for broadcasting and our followers on social media.
To clarify one, Byron’s comments were related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inadequate and an unfortunate elected formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologised to the mission and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming stack in the CBC Olympic Edition," he said.
“I referred to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.”
Of course, it was not intended to disregard and I'm very sorry."
Buyers in Primark are angry about woman trying shameless underwear in the middle of the shop
Buyers didn’t know where to see when a woman left her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try underwear.
In order to worsen the situation, she recorded how she looked in it, she pulled out and put it back to the shelf.
She continued to explore and tried four pairs of underwear in a shop at the Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underwear before she laid her back into the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman tried the underwear, "she drew up again and left the shop without buying anything."
She said, "The people couldn't believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underwear from the outfit, pulled out her own pants and pants and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a little more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, crazy like Oskar."
“Everyone looked when she removed the underwears that she obviously didn’t like, as she put them back in the shelf.”
She repeated the same with three other underwears before she finally decided that she didn’t like anything, clothed and left.
"They didn't seem to disturb that they watched someone - or thinking about the person who might buy the underwear she had tried."
Mrs. Davidson, 33, who lived in Kent, said, "How rude to think that someone would take underwear with them home who had another person and weren't washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added, “As I found, the employees have tried to pull out the clothes out of sale after they went – what’s just as good.”
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underwear and find out that another woman had to dress her and removed her and she wasn't washed."
A spokesman of Primark said, "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9 in our department in Folkstone."
All products in question were pulled out of sale.
How to protect yourself from arms attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a major master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance.
Regardless of whether you are approaching you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spindle for your robber.
When you approach you from the back, then you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and “go out of the shot line,” says Mizrachi.
Then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you beat him in the face with your free elbow.
Then, with the knees, hit him in the bar and turn, while the attacker crawls from pain, the weapon from his hands, hit him with the run into his face and move backwards while they direct the weapon on him.
In the case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line, take the gun and turn it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
Simultaneously, move the weight to the weapon and beat the attacker to the chest, then turn the weapon out of his handle before they move backwards and target the weapon on him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see precisely what Mizrachi is doing.
But remember that with a robbery it’s safest to deliver your money – unless you’re not Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright takes his tongue in Europe’s dirtyest places for a guide
A British traveler underwent his immune system and killer flex a serious examination - by declined some of the most dirty and evil places in Europe.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, demonstrated his trains on a euro box, a cliff on the Piccadilly Circus, a toilet sink button and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before the blade of each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to go on.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to the daylight.
The idea of removing the dishwasher button of a train toilet already used by thousands of others may be completely rejecting, but in fact, more bad bacteria are in a kitchen dishwasher.
During his journey throughout Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, he left nothing that he declined, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resistance of his intestine by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public landscapes at railway stations to toilet wash buttons, the task definitely put its immune system under a sample
In the movie he said, “I was already a child I was relatively worried about my health and I put all the things in my mouth, earth, worms, and mud water.”
In the movie, he was definitely justified to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
Its test pattern showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.
Compared to this, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leave after its luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60.
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the movie he says, "That's close to the worst I've been looking for in a toilet."
There is nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to hit anything here because it's horrible inside here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both milk acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune systems.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We carried out crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of only talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health, and how they are linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide more information about it to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had lecked some of the things I told him to leak, just like the evil Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to make Ian lick it and others where it was pretty difficult.
I’m happy that we’ve taken some of these dirty likings on the movie.”
In a 2015 survey carried out by Valio, 84% of all respondents associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58% said they at least occasionally use products containing attached lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial Family Destroyed Prior to Delocation Social Apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left her social apartment after a delocation with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorised her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the home association found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls showed clamping holes, wood dials were ripped up, waste was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.
The family has been relocated and it is believed to be living in a private accommodation now.
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment would no longer be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don't have to live in this way.
There are many things to consider as this property will probably be seen as not such a beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is famous and its reputation is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that had caused the family included street fighting with baseball struggles, intimidators of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, disputes and curses.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the rental contract, received an order for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be broken down, old garbage was found
In the property in which drugs were traded in the past, wood dials were pulled up.
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing violently dismissed her and her partner from the property this week after giving them a extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer.
The delocation was delighted by facilitated neighbors who said their lives were made hell.
One said, "They didn't joke for anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
“Today tomorrow we couldn’t sleep.”
We stood up because it was so quiet here - that we are not used to!
Now that they are finally gone, it will be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said it would have abstracted the family to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called regularly for 20 years.
On the overwhelmed side of the municipal house, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant abstained from taking any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as a delocation is always the last step that Cornwall housing considers.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have boldly approached us and have given us the information.
I hope that this development will be given comfort to some neighbors and the message that anti-social behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogation
Workers of the house administration will now have to clean out waste mountains surrounding the house
In 2014, the police carried out a race in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as wages, parapherals and cash amounting to £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after announced guilty of possession of a Class B drug in commercial intent.
She claimed that the money was for a grave stone of her son Lee Skeldon, who killed in 2013 in a car accident.
After being homeless, Tanya and her partner will now be assumed to live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were lubricated with graffiti.
Police say they will reject tenants who do not follow the house order
Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall told that delocation is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not follow the household order.
“This goes to those who think they can behave without self-accusing, as well as those who have been damaged by such a behavior,” she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal are panicked after a deep-flying military jet flying over the beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force Aircraft Launched an Incredible Fall Flight
The air forces said it was on a training flight, but relieved that there was no safety risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists started to fall in panic after a deep-flying jet dropped down over a full beach.
Dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft fled almost in a captivable proximity over the sun worshippers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidayers jumped up when they began understandably to worry about the noise of the nozzle drives without first seeing what came to them through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-by on social media, said: "It fled twice really very deep past and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on Aveiro beach were panicked when the plane came out of darkness and fled incredibly deeply
The Portuguese air forces said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them.
The spokesman said that the jet flyed slightly deeper than usual because of the poor viewing conditions nearby surface fires, but the air forces sustained that security was at no time endangered.
Surface fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, in which four people also died on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese air forces today said that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the circumstances – strong fog and smoke – which restricted his view.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise.
Supercup: Barca with concerns for Seville
Sevilla - FC Barcelona fights on Sunday for the first step towards the first title win in the new football season.
The Catalans start out in the duel around the Spanish Super Cup against the FC Sevilla, the backplay rises three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner has to renounce Neymar, among others, at the cup finalist and ruling European League champion at the force fair, who denies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil.
Goalie Marc-Andre is also missing.
The German suffered a knee-diving strip during training, which was cleared at least in the first place at Barca for Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique so far renounced a clear decision in this regard and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other applications to do so.
Before the first mandatory game of the new game time, the Spanish master has doubts about the fitness state of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a Liverpool test game with 0:4.
Even at 3:2 on Wednesday in the sample gallop against Sampdoria, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really know to convince.
Seville, in turn, has digested the 2:3 lower position after the European Super Cup against Real Madrid and seeks the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona has so far been successful with eleven record winners in this candidate.
Ma Long in a league of table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic winner.
The 27-year-old in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday defeated his countryman and "Title Defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.5.4.4).
The first of the world rankings took the "Golden Grand Slam" with success in World Cup, World Cup, World Tour Finals and Olympics.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese went to the final game as expected and made the title between themselves.
This was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
Last non-Chinese on the top Olympic trip was former SVS NÖ Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left on the plate alone, between the sentences and time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had turned back to the tribunes and left their guardians alone on one another in fair competition.
"The matches up to here I played for my country."
"In the final I'm playing for myself," Zhang said.
After the match, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma really had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
Then he determined the pace on the plate and left Zhang from there only a total of 13 points.
Due to Ma’s superiority, the expected match did not develop.
However, there was sufficiently breathtaking ball change to be seen.
Mizutani won the game for bronze against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonow 4:1.
In his quarter-final against German European Champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the Belarus had attracted a rib injury, then was in medical treatment, and had to "fine" with blade.
The Sweden Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) have, by the way, become Olympic fourth in similar high table tennis ages.
Donald Trump acknowledges violent problems in the election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. republicans is plagued by massive concerns, even in traditional conservative states, to lose their majority.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the previous Republican high town of Utah.
A rare moment when the generally large and self-secure multimillionaire expressed concerns, as correspondents reported.
After he has thrown 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, the doubt of his success in the struggle for the White House now grows.
“We have huge problems in Utah,” Trump told evangelical Christians, whom he asked for support in major states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
He was faulty to report false reports about his candidate, he once again took up his well-known media appeals.
Category: Republican high towns
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a survey by SurveyUSA from June, Trump and his competitor were the same from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton.
Other institutes see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common to Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton’s forward again: “As I did so far.”
This will either be successful, or I will make a very beautiful, long holiday.
He does nothing but to “tell the truth.”
If it doesn’t end up rich for him for reasons of political correctness, that’s okay, Trump said.
Then I will return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party had threatened to remove funds to support his election campaign if he should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead of this, the Republican candidates for the Congress would be more armed.
Olympics: Third Doping Testing Fraud
The IOC wants to establish a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's light athletes threaten after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee informed it immediately to establish a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had reported that the former Sprinter and today’s coach, John Anzrah, in the Olympic village had given an urine sample under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to Kenya’s team leadership by the doping controllers.
The World Association IAAF has requested the IOC for information on the case to strive its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," the IAAF statement said.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and expendited himself as Ferguson Rotich, delivered and signed the trial," said Kenya's Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s list of training controls.
In 2015, Ferguson Rotich became a World Cup celebration of over 800 meters in Beijing.
Four days earlier Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio games.
He is supposed to have informed athletes from his country’s money payments about upcoming doping tests.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation in the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offences.
During the announcement of more than 2,000 doping target controls laid down by the IOC before the Rio games, it was unusually noted earlier that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into vision.
The world anti-doping agency had had a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics.
Consequently, the WADA Kenya took from the list of countries whose doping fighting complies with the rules of the WADA.
Kenya is considered a major runner nation.
The country’s light athletes won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of television reports of the ARD, charges have been repeatedly accused that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had employed them in Russian light athletics.
It could be demonstrated that this sport was covered and systematically doped.
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.
A surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the Temple of Classic and fulfilled the role of Mary a youth dream.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the guidance of Venezuelan director Gustavo Dudamel: “This music is full of rhythm,” he whispers.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this scene, Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers her love with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First because it is musically exceptional!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she is wise, of course naive, and very passionate.
"They are very similar to me, my Italian character I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such a honor for us to work with her.
She is a hugely generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate!"
Directing is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of your movements, in your eyes, it is your life!
It’s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a joyful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm McKinley, the “West Side Story” is highly current: “In this piece it’s about prejudice and fanatism.”
Today we had the refugees, the Puertorians went to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.
They are the same topics, and they are just as significant today as they were at the time.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British school girls who left London last year to join ISIS, died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said her family had known about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the group’s bowlwork in the country, ITV News reported Thursday.
Sultana was seventeen years old and died shortly after planning to leave the war-backed country and return to England.
"We can only hope that the only good is - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war area - to prevent people from ever making this decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other school girls from eastern London entered a plane to Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana’s family was reported that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain candidate for the Upper Court in the event of an election victory at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Upper Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland’s confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge at the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference he expected to choose Garland "with a certain degree of certainty" from Clinton.
A spokesman of Reid later said he didn’t talk to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and speculate.
He praised Garland and said Clinton’s team wouldn’t worry about trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the top judge of the U.S. Appeal Court for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland’s nomination, being Lacae and helpers of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the presidential office.
Treats wants naked calendar for women and men
The Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to publish a Pirelli-inspired Kalendar for 2017 in the 1970s.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of topmodels for their NU museum Kalendar for 2017.
Treats’ chief editor Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his naked magazine differs from oldschool playboys as “Playboy is for men.”
I'm doing this for women.
It seems that he believes that the Kalendar is doing it too.
"We have to return to the presentation of timeless and classic nakedness, where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these pictures of a female body," Shaw said in a press release.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or personally on open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community is counting for mass refuge
“Whoever doesn’t adapt and praise Erdogan will sit on packed bags,” says Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gulen-Near-Stiftung Dialog and World.
In the short-term, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects thousands of protective seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even become “a few hundred thousand,” the chairman of the association Ali Toprak believes.
Due to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s harsh action after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community expects a mass flight to Germany.
“In the short term, I am expecting thousands of thousands, in the medium term, with some hundreds of thousands of protective seekers from Turkey in Germany when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition,” said the union’s chairman Ali Toprak of the World on Friday.
Because the government covered Kurdish high cities with criminal actions months ago, 500,000 Kurdish within Turkey are fleeing.
After the outdated coup, still secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state who receives refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," Toprak said.
He complained for the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevian cities.
Erdogan is seeking to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
“They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled over the past hundred years,” said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
He called for the Federal Government to "position itself as sharp as Austria is against Erdogan and his followers."
In Germany, there is also a "hexen hunt" against Erdogan critics.
For the first time in the last few months, I’m not safe in Germany.
The German branch of the Gülen-Movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurdish and oppositional.
Firemarking as Gülen trailer destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.
“Whoever does not adapt and praise Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, by the way, also the Kemalists and Seculars,” said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gulen-Near Foundation Dialog and Education, the “World”.
As reported in the newspaper, the Turks have already made the largest group of asylum-recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup.
As of June 30, these were 11,386 people, and therefore almost 29% of all recognized asylum (39,625).
This survey does not find those fleeed from war, poverty or perspectivelessness.
Asylum entitled under the Basic Law are exclusively political, i.e. by state, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer voting campaign - and the travellers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.
2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Hard Parliament has already decided early this year.
Because stupidly than so far, summer holidays, heat and land day election campaign - that bites.
The locals who are to be convinced by the electoral fighters are on vacation.
Most holiday travellers in the country, traveling to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddendense, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country day.
These are practical problems: in the holidays, helpers who hang the posters, inflate air balloons, distribute flyers, and at the end count votes are simply struggling to drive.
Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to let Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again go over the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just started.
And it’s also about: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now in surveys clearly behind the CDU.
It is exciting how strong Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unremarkable election campaign, you can see from his large posters.
He travels throughout the country, distributing roses and plausing a little bit with the people, as did his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, Searing has gotten cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the flower of the AfD.
Her refugee policy, her "we make this" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably now cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidate, Minister of Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already seen how it is when you are at the wrong time in the right place of election.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major audiences; Merkel is located in the northeast of the Bundestag election circle.
But the target audience did not vote, there were more Northern Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority of other federal countries," Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently complained in the NDR.
But it is also no shame for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely refrains from the usual campaigns on marketplaces and from shopping centers with parasols and air balloons.
That, as Kokert says, plays only a "under-range role".
The Union has also noticed that you broke out the base on the country that it has to strive very hard to find a wire to the people again.
They are like the left, the SPD, the green: hardly present in the wide range of the country.
The advice of the CDU election fighter Kokert to his co-fighters, however, is also self-explaining: "You have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."
Because a lot is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed election campaign.
In surveys, the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19).
At the 2011 election, the SPD was still clearly won with 35.6% before the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the surveys, is expected to create the jump into the landtag.
They make the holiday not a modern virtue and move their election campaign largely to the Internet.
"Online election campaign," he called the president of the country, Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green electoral fighters go on trace search for local voters among the holidaymen.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curves with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and still finds it beautiful.
Her impression: "Voting holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no penalty."
B27-sanation: restaurants suffer from blocking
At the speed with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to remember.
For those responsible for the construction work, which begins at 5:30 in the morning and ends only at 20:00 in the morning, there is praise everywhere.
“They have made everything pretty thick,” says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet tank station.
This is a super team.
There is no delay either.
The construction site could be moved to the south scheduled at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything is going to be finished.
It is also praised the reception of the responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of relief entries.
Since the construction site has moved to the south on Monday and the Aspergstraße has also been blocked in Offerdingen and therefore also remains the connection to Rottenburg, the traffic situation has relaxed within the site.
The citizens can now travel from Fretterdingen from the B27 again on both sides.
The evasion traffic through the place seems to come back.
“There were partially significant complaints,” says the deputy chief executive officer Florian King, responsible for the traffic management.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noises because many mushroom paths were looking for themselves and were more familiar with their navigation than the signage.
This led to some trucks in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality strongly requested the Mössingen measuring vehicle.
“There were substantial exceeding,” says King, who once took a look at the situation on site.
There have been two to three blows per minute.
The fastest was on the road with 77 hour kilometres in the pace-30 zone.
Since the construction site has moved, it has become quiet.
For businessmen at B 27, it’s just a little comfort that the road is open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Businessmen don’t like to look into the maps.
But that the B-27 sanction has led to revenue breaks, let everyone you ask look through.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Whoever has less to do with the "end customer", i.e. for other companies, the repair has hardly consequences for them.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highlight decline" at the car house Maier, but also admits that of course "the lack of racing awareness."
The most controlled are the locals along the street.
J. Albert Göhner, the owner of the steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.
This is already threatening to exist.
Not only is it, but all the restaurants have “hartly hit it.”
The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.
We have to be happy with every euro revenue.
The sales losses are “more than 50 percent.”
The road renovation has thrown its operation “back for two years.”
Half of his employees had to dismiss.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been released, the policy would have responded differently.
Instead, President Jörg Schmidt, on a request from Göhner, answered whether there could be a financial compensation, with the notice that the guesthouse would otherwise benefit from the benefits of the situation at B27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the repair.
Göhner knows of other districts where such a great deal was handled.
In all cases, Göhner is sure that his guest house will continue to exist.
Finally, the family business has been located here since 1715, referring to the long history.
He can understand that other regular guests are now looking less frequently through because of the complicated traffic guidance.
If you can't go, it's beautiful elsewhere.
The fact that his client returns after the end of the rehabilitation work, Göhrer has no doubt about it.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird influenza, Göhner holds the impact of the B 27 construction works on his customers for the largest crisis his hospital has experienced in his long history.
Six months of construction, that’s brutal.
On behalf of the fight against terror, laws are constantly screwed.
After the recent attacks, Minister of Interior de Maizière now introduces a thick security package.
But what does a state of tolerance have to do with terror?
What does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconcilier.
All his proposals are "politically supportable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of Interior in the introduction of his new security package.
They do not overwhelm anyone.
Other, further points would be discussed at first within the parties.
I also participate in this.
As a Minister of Interior, however, he was located on results and on a "accessible consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière has left a little time before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.
But they are now more extensive for this.
Some things are already known, announced, engaged: that a new safety authority should take care of the cracking encrypted communication is not new.
Not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU rules on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video monitoring and staff for security authorities is not surprising.
In part, de Maizière launches a second start for proposals that were not to be made with the SPD: he wants to put sympathy advertising for terrorist groups under penalty and jihadists with double citizenship off the German passport.
“This will be difficult points for the SPD,” the CDU man acknowledges.
He still believes that this is advantageous and doesn’t call for anything that has no opportunities for the coalition partner.
A few new ideas are presenting de Maizière too.
They have it partly in themselves: he plans quick procedures for displacement and more possibilities for detention of people prior to displacement.
Refugees who are targeted to the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
In tolerations for refused asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than so far – such as those who commit offences or consciously throw their papers away to conceal their identity.
Some of them are political and legally heavy.
Some things also appear unfavourable and leaves questions open.
And on some points - for example, in the inequality of patients - the question arises: What does it actually have to do with certainty and terror?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be argued that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about safety in the light of the high numbers of refugees.
And things that people deeply employed could not be detached even during election campaign times.
Inner safety is enormously focused.
Only the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
Insecurity is great.
Yes, there are election fights.
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in position in the topic of internal security.
In the past few days, the two parties came up.
Only a major dispute about the equipment of the federal police, then about a collection of security ideas of some EU internal ministers, in which the Resorts also require a Burka ban and a deviation from double citizenship.
De Maizière is also working here for reconciliating tones.
From a retreat from the double pass, he has nothing.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
Re-open it is not meaningful.
In the case of a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "advantageous" for the coalition partner, it must show itself.
There's a lot of things in it, which could make a dispute.
However, the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the topic of internal security.
Sigmar Gabriel said, “The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security.”
Volkswagen is still going through.
Despite diesel scandals, the delivery numbers rise worldwide.
But not in all markets it runs round.
In the recall action there are spins about a term.
Volkswagen starts behavior in the second half of the year.
In the past year, Europe’s largest car manufacturer can still have a plus thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
However, in July, the core brand VW weakened, especially in West Europe, and thus loaded the overall sale, as reported by the Dax company.
In July, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than last month with 449100 cars.
In Western Europe alone, after China’s second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the home market of Germany, the deliveries were sacked by almost a sixth.
Brand sales manager Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July to two sales days less in Europe.
Furthermore, in some core markets there has been a retention of purchases due to "changing economic frameworks".
In addition to the situation around the attempt to push in Turkey, the British vote to exit the EU has also burdened, a spokesperson explained.
In the U.S., where the exhaust gas affair first escalated, there is also a minus to be booked.
Large support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected Lower Saxony household trademark continues to be smitten by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a 0.9 percent extradition minus is available to 3.37 million vehicles.
Group sales manager Fred Kappler was able to present a sales surplus from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time, 5,904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated a software exhaust test.
In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million cars to the workshops.
In the course of the renovation, VW confirmed that the renovation of the cars has no negative effects.
After reconstruction of the vehicles, there is no worsening in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
The car manufacturer is giving the customer a "garantie equal" certificate after repair, but does not speak of a "garantie", as it was called on Friday in companies.
Reasons are legal finesses.
The Focus had reported that Volkswagen now provided its German customers with a guarantee of re-arranged diesel models.
This would have been confirmed by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport has confirmed that this meeting was held.
"VW has to fully fulfil the requirements of my investigative commission and the KBA."
"Deviations from them are not accepted," Federal Traffic Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) said.
VW has taken the guarantee that no deterioration occurs in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after reconstruction and all type-relevant vehicle values have in stock unchanged.
Volkswagen himself uses the term "garantie" but not as it was called in business circles.
With the wide term "garantie", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, will come into a workshop with a motor damage half a year after repair - and could bring it back to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important to avoid any other damage that does not have anything to do with the exhaust gas scandal, as it was stated, that there is an uncertainty regarding possible guarantee arrangements.
This is why VW does not use the term "garantie".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee demands rich savings from criminal interest rates – as a second institute in Germany.
Head of Banking Josef Paul said on Thursday, “It’s only about 139 customers who parked 40 million euros on giro or day money accounts.”
The Federal Federation of German Banks speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it: normal savings wouldn’t have to fear to pay for their large penal interest.
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay it 0.4% penal interest.
This fee is required by Raiffeisenbank Gmund from private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros to turnover or daily money accounts from September.
“The first 100,000 euros are free.”
“The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future,” Paul said.
He has been keeping 40 million euros for a long time, which could be removed from one day to the other and which he cannot use.
“These are on the central bank account with me and cause 0.4 percent costs,” the bank chief said.
"I can't put $4,000 for every million."
The costs are now continued in accordance with the causer principle.
Just leaving the cash in the treasury of the Raiffeisenbank would be too dangerous: "I've experienced four attacks, I don't want the fifth yet!"
Most customers had understanding and switched to other investment forms.
Only a few passed to other banks.
The Cooperative Association of Bayern said: “The ECB’s extreme monetary policy rate causes significant costs for all banks.”
Wear them alone is "continuously impossible for business."
Therefore, some German banks have increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penal interest rates for deposits of three million euros, the Thüringen Volksbank and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its 2014 Skatbank office.
Michael Kemmer, Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Association, said, “We don’t expect private customers to pay spatially fees for deposits, so the competition in Germany under banks and savings is too strong.”
A banker said there is “a client equipped with a little more luxurious wealth on the Tegernsee.”
“This can become a problem for a small bank,” if it keeps money for free.
Founded in 1911, the Cooperative Bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region.
The Cooperative Association of Bayern “is currently no other banks known to calculate an expense replacement for private customer deposits,” said Ernst.
The president of the Federal Association of German Volksbanks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, said at the end of June, “The threshold to go negative towards the private customer is very, very high.”
The competition is hard, and it threatens the migration of investors to compete.
Customers in Germany will not like this in the width.
Destination Plates: Who Buys Plates?
Solid middle-aged men love plates.
Before you haste to the commentary part to see it under the pseudonym NotAlleenSoloMittlerenAlders with heavy insults, this statement derives from current data.
According to YouGov, the resurrection of records is not due to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical items, but due to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently purchased a plate are forecast between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older plate buyers retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
Do YouGov’s results vote?
If this blog was a news report on television, the camera would follow me while running in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and gesturing wildly before standing, holding my hands and saying something decisive like, "So let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Sohos slowly loses his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic plates special shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand immediately close to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I followed by Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20), is a day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
He's a collector, I ask?
"I guess yes," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the shot by email, I didn’t follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates he couldn’t afford when they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and pleated.
“Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12, things where I was probably too young to buy them to me,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my laster.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and led themselves to buy their old records again.
From the conversations I have conducted, people have usually dismissed themselves from their collection around 1998 or 1999.
“Customers who once sold their plates to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their plates again,” he says.
This would explain the boom of supporters of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?
It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record shops offer a calming community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers started the contactless payment system.
Some plate fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar plate covers, from items that awaken happy youth memories.
“I think sometimes it can be the filling of an empty or possessing material property as a kind of comfort,” says Wez.
This is like me as a collector and I think it is like me in many people.
It is a simple way to deal with mentally.
“We are like their social workers!” an employee flutes from a record stack.
A ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month have not listened yet.
The survey also found that 41% have a plate player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate do not have a plate player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned as I leaves through a stack at Bossa Nova compilation.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Data Number: Three Middle Ages Men) has noticed a "trophean aspect" of the revival.
“Someone came here recently and said, ‘I don’t have a recorder, but I would like to buy a radiohead so I can put it in the shelf.’”
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product loading, less music loading.
We have people who say, "I don't have a player."
These are younger people, not older people who come slowly in.
Fopp, who has dedicated almost a whole floor to the records, has a colourful audience when I enter.
There are couples around the 70s, tourists taking photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Beasts’ latest synthesizer and sex packed pop instead of experimental jazz sounds from speakers - it’s good to see such a diversity with customers.
None of them looks particularly lonely, but swimming psychological traumas are difficult to find when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of the plates for sale.
It makes a window bump rather than a big purchase.
She doesn’t earn much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It’s easy to listen to music from a computer or otherwise, but the beauty of plates is...” she drives off with an infamous suffocation.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to counter the jeans hotpants, I watched a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at it - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plate art".
But given that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers into the deep sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.
It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most for luxury items like plates.
Even though my research showed that YouGov’s results vote, they, at least in plate stores in Soho, do not take into account the large number of female collectors and plate lovers that exist in reality, plate stores and online forums.
These people are probably working hard in school or in offices.
They certainly don’t spend their Thursday tomorrow with bumming through Berwick Street’s record shops and leaves through records while avoiding the rigid eye of a terrible, 30-year-old false moderator who runs nothing about the shoulders of middle-aged men.
The Greenland hair is the longest living spinal animal - Video report
Scientists say that Greenland hai has the longest lifespan of all vertebral animals on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigates the shark, says that the record was in a female that is assumed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French Court Refuges Offering Refugee Camps in the Jungle
A French court has rejected an offer by authorities in Calais, destroying dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a trial this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be authorized to break down 72 provisional businesses in which people within the warehouse, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, offer hairdresser services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pences) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be destroyed because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which are at risk of fire and health.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants are important because the free meals offered by the government-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the warehouse.
They also expressed that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the dismissal of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of Calais’ prefecture are “absolutely understandable.”
Judge Jean-François Molla said food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened by the low-rise was the Jungle Book Kids’ Café of the camp, which is operated in non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to keep the Kids’ Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, the closing would be "a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
The two help organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the migrant estimated on Friday that the number of living in the jungle village has increased to over 9,000 – the highest to date – after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains fighting
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time ride, the cyclist Tony Martin will not be left under control.
"I keep looking at the World Cup, stay confident and fight on," the 31-year-old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro to Facebook.
He didn’t have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the sugar hat.
"It's hard for me to comment on the time driving from yesterday," Martin said.
He needs to analyze quietly what causes would have led to the debacle.
At the time-driving World Cup in October in Qatar, Martin actually wanted to fight for the title.
“I’m going to look at everything we’ve changed in the last time.”
"This also counts my position," wrote the three-time driving world champion, who lost more than three minutes on Wednesday at the 54.5 km at the Olympic winner Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympics: Tennis Professional Missed Semi-Finals

Group starts up for live video game transmissions
Watching other people when playing video games is a giant center - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it.
The technology company buys the start-up beam specializing in this hobby.
How much money flows for the acquisition, Microsoft didn’t report on Thursday.
Beam launched its offer only in January and has already more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others while playing, but also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and face enemies as well as provide equipment items.
Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is aiming to help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The employees of the start-up, who has so far headquartered in Seattle, Washington, move to Microsoft headquartered in California’s Redmond, according to Beam co-founder and chief Matt Salsamendi.
For the customers, therefore, nothing should be changed by the acquisition.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased by the Amazon online dealer in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to Google Mother’s Alphabet.
Here is the Enforcement Trailer
Germany’s raser needs to adjust to the next generation of speed meters: in various federal countries, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash equipment will be tested to transfer speed measuring devices particularly effectively.
The futuristic Enforcement Trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used at accident focus, for example, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, there is often no necessary infrastructure for motorway buildings or bridges with temporary speed limits to ensure compliance with speed limits with a stationary lighter.
However, a lasting mobile structure can be too dangerous or complex.
The Enforcement trailer is self-controlled: Its battery lasts five days in continuous measurement operation, the case data is encrypted through a modem.
Laser measurement technology also allows all vehicles to be captured across multiple traces at the same time.
Variable speed limits as well as passage bans by time, driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In a high-risk condition, you can move the trailer with each car with trailer coupling according to the manufacturer.
In order to not simply be stolen, it is reduced in the measurement operation, so that the wheels disappear in the armed and, by the way, also shotproof outer cover.
Furthermore, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the lighter from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested in various federal countries according to Vitronic.
Foreign authorities also shine with the new technology: recently, France has redesigned 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
UK brings silver in 7 rugby after Fiji Masterclass gold
Britain’s impressive performance at the 7-rugby came to an abrupt stop in the final Thursday evening at the last obstacle in the form of the Fijis, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji issued a master class in handling, side-stepping, back-up, line running and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sustained by the not too bad comfort price of the silver medal – Britain’s fourth day – and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The significant defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back to them in the final.
But regardless of it, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in best form in this form.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a British will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's chief trainer Ben Ryan, the former chief of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind it.
Eight years ago, she lost every game under Ryan at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they only lost one.
This slide will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderfully and left the GB attacks out of fun.
It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if you were running in riding buses, the World Series winners went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau was overwhelmed in the corner.
With another four-minute game time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he was converting.
12-0 and GB have hardly touched the ball.
An outstanding Mitchell tackle stopped Mann Leone Nakarawa’s mountain to achieve a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua set a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the repump and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravou prepared by further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a gate.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It’s like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's how it's.
GB carried out basic changes in the half-time and closed the Fiji gap... for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova passed through after a brilliant interplay from Fiji.
Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the Southern Sea Island Islanders whose fans sang, swing flags and dancing on the tribune.
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame set the i-top with another attempt in the last seconds.
The piff sounded, the Fiji's embraced themselves and GB kicked devastatingly beaten in the grass.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated Japan in the semi-final at 20-5 and the UK pushed South Africa in a short semi-final match from the race - Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and achieved a gate under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late fighting by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-aside team, secured the win – and therefore the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting the trainer’s cancer to ruder victory
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games and what it means.
From the first hit to the last, 220 hard hive that entered history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though there were only the two sitting on the ruder, there were three votes in the boat. The echo of trainer Robin Williams, was present when they rolled to the second Olympic gold in the two consecutive without taxwoman, the first women in the history of British sports that set such a scale.
Her dominance was absolute, after all, her 39th unbeaten, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding over the surface with the elegance of tails, which does not reflect the kind of triumph to dance.
Behind every gold in the wheel, there is a batalion of acceptable helpers that contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who didn’t know if he would survive that day at all than was diagnosed with him cancer.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer that can be operated and they did it.
If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he could start treatment in early 2014, outside the season, which held the interruption to a minimum if, in such circumstances, this is at all the right term.
I needed money, so I had to go better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
Running in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediate victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-off morning spent a little more than else talking about and tried to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wrack this week. That's perhaps somewhat extreme, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much that means to me how much I and Helen and Robin worked.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anyone, so he's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn’t have wanted a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents were unable to support.
Even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to open, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very captured at the moment.
Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important not to let go.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't trying to do something great.
We didn’t want fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover will appear next week on a wedding, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
It was so new for me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
That feels so much better,” she said.
Example of clarity for 31 years
Ruppert Göller, Managing Director of the Water Purpose Association "Veitensteingruppe", is retired.
The association is considered to be "exemplary in Bavaria".
A small French drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
This was said some time ago in the original tone in a contribution of the Bayerisches Broadcasting.
Shortly later, the Water Forum of the Government of Underfranken honored the purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein group was "Bayernwide as example".
Behind all this, Rupert Göller, who was 31 years employee in the Zweck Association, 28 of whom as Managing Director.
Now he was retired at the age of 65.
The Drinking Water Association of the Veitenstein Group based in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn municipality, promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and villages with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach are members.
For other cities and municipalities there are water delivery agreements.
The current Chairman of Breitbrunn, Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a waterkeeper in 1985 and was appointed as CEO of the Zweck Association in 1988.
“His tasks have been very diverse and they extended from the water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, budgeting, calculating fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends,” said the president.
As an outstanding event, it called the launch and opening of the new fountains (1994), land purchases in the area of the new fountains (1998) and the compensation of farmers, the rehabilitation of high containers (1999), the repurchase of a central computer control (2004) and the shared renewals of water lines.
There has been no stop and we have always taken up news because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio, she praised Göller’s faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has used a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and has lived the water-purpose association as if it was his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the concept of success of the Veitenstein group to reduce nitrates before the water forum of the district.
He received a lot of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller praised waterguard Alfons Griebel, who worked 28 years with him.
He's the best water guard and he was a loyal crash.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
In his perspective, he described the fountain building and restructuring of the purpose association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, however, was the pipe break at the high container at Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, they had to work all night so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Also, the supply of Neubrunn was only once able to maintain because the high container from Pettstadt was filled with tubes.
The management of the Drinking Water Association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who started the succession of Rupert Göller.
Sopranist Anna Netrebko openly turns to the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
“The medicine has made great progress,” said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the illness was recognized with her son, she thought she must die.
The eight-year-old Tiago has gone well forward and now learns privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: When I ask him something what's going back two years when I sang at Milan Scala, he remembers nothing," Netrebko said.
He is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko’s connection with Bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship status in Bargteheide - Man Shooting on Lifemate
A 35-year-old man shot his partner on Friday at 10.45 a.m. in a multi-family house in Bargteheide, Stormarn, and injured her.
"The man himself called to us and stated to have shot his lifemate," a police spokesman said.
The perpetrator is fleeing, after him he is publicly condemned.
Meanwhile, in the country, because Sven S. might be on the car.
The man is approximately 1.80 meters tall, muscular, burned and has a smoothness.
The police have published a photo of him.
But it's a few years old.
In the meantime, the man wears a smoothness.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He can still wear the weapon, the police say.
Whoever sees Sven S, call the 110.
The police talk about a "relationship status".
The victim was the anniversary of 1988, the perpetrator of 1981.
The responsible police in Lübeck did not initially want to give information about the tathergang or the relationship between perpetrators and victims, but confirmed that a person had been killed.
"This is a killing crime."
"We are not saying more currently," a police spokesman in Lübeck said.
According to eyewitnesses, a special operation command (SEK) was on the crime site.
Steel - Light view for German Steel Industry
The crisis bags and energy-intensive German steel industry remains saved from additional costs in millions.
Financial burdens that the industry threatened from the eco-stream funding are from the table.
It remains with the freedom of the renewable energy replacement at inventory facilities for the so-called self-electricity production in the German steel industry, Federal Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) told Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ, Friday).
"I'm really happy that we finally managed to achieve this after two years of heavy negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask steel manufacturers who use high-oven gases to generate electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel said the WAZ there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants, an EEG replacement of 20% falls.
However, this is not raised in the steel industry either.
The IG Metal welcomed Germany’s agreement with the EU Commission on self-electricity.
Thus, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely defined.
Gabriel’s successful efforts have special importance for the steel industry.
“In terms of our campaign ‘Steel is the Future’, this is a first step.”
"More people have to follow."
"Even in the reform of emissions rights trade, climate and employment goals are to be considered," said IG Metall-Head Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity since the financial crisis in 2008 and a significant price pressure.
Last year, the situation continued to exacerbate when the world’s largest producer country China threw steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers claim Chinese steel groups price dumping.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has been a little relaxed.
On the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable price recovery is.
The German industry premium Thyssenkrupp remained careful on Thursday.
Lastly, the prices would have stagnated again.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude the closures of individual works.
In the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced about six percent less raw steel with 3.4 million tonnes than in the previous month, as the Economic Association said on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the amount produced now declined in the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been 2% below the previous year.
In the coming months, the association expects an increasing emission thanks to an improved order situation.
community, mind, health: singing do seniors good
The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her lifetime: as a young girl she was at the school choir, in the teaching office she deployed music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a trial she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says.
In addition, she does something good in her health and mind.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the pleasure of music, Hackler describes.
Through regular meeting, seniors can create and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often dissolve in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To dismiss and organize yourself, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of union."
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, Hackler says.
Seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Anyone who regularly demands his lungs doesn’t get out of the push so quickly even in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing has often a very special effect on elderly people, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Community of Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, common singing had a much higher importance, it belonged to the daily life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people raises many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through song texts and especially melodies, people who have been sick self removed from long-term events.
In singing, the head is also required for special performance, Lenz explains.
Focusing at the same time on your own voice and a predetermined rhythm and adapting to the other singers – this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not only focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you experience through singing in the choir, Hackler says.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
Self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
Showing myself: If I practice for something long, I will be better and grow beyond myself - strengthen this experience.
Good reasons to start singing are enough.
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.
Not singing alone, with 50 singing people, who hears there when a sound goes next to it?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.
Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly.
Many senior headquarters can also be found through the internet.
Anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help in the Internet search.
Anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing does the soul well and has something freeing - that applies to any age.
Cats are more sensitive than cats to the cries of young animals
Biologists have examined the effect of cats’ calls on adult animals in Hannover.
To their surprise, the miaues also did not let the male cold – but they always behaved the same unlike the females.
Female cats can recognize the excitement of cats babies at the mial of the little ones.
They respond by 10 percent faster to the sounds of kittens that are in a great degree, as scientists from the Veterinary College and Medical College of Hannover (MHH) have found.
Kater also responds to the calls of kittens, but always the same.
"The acoustic differences between the meadow of less and strongly excited young animals are either not perceptible or not of importance for the male," said biolog Wiebke Konerding from the MHH.
She is the first author of the study published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found that the duration and height of the kitten script differs with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight cats from the MHH animals were observed.
They were played on the one hand by little ones who were taken out of the worfbox for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were faced with screams of more excited kittens, which were also raised up.
The researchers believe their results are significant despite the low sample.
"All females, even those who didn't have their own childhood, reacted differentiated to the screams," Konerding said.
They turned faster to the speaker when this call played the most excited kitten.
This ability may be born or developed with the gender maturity.
“A surprise was that the males have reacted at all,” the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have several times examined the reactions of women and men to baby noises in humans.
Also, some studies showed that women were more sensitive to infants, whether or not they were already mothers, biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski attacks Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükur is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, a detention order has been issued against the former football star Hakan Sücur.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football match will take place again in Turkey.
Before the duel of the archrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is announced.
Even when the emergency state was imposed after the collapse attempt in July, the government said that the daily life of normal citizens should not be impaired.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected to belong to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom one is held responsible for the attempt to push.
There is no stop before football either.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sücur, the prosecutor’s office issued a detention order.
Accordingly, the sucure currently living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sucur is supposed to be a follower of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the emergency state imposed first for 90 days still applies until October, it actually has no impact on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "democracy water" on public places across the country declared Erdogan to end on Wednesday.
Sports is, like the whole country, divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Particularly fans of the Besiktas Worker Club are traditionally not among the president’s friends.
What, however, combines the majority of the Turks in history in the face of dramatic experiences is the strict rejection of military slopes.
There are even the fans themselves agree - no matter whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
At the cup winners "Gala" it will return especially to Lukas Podolski.
The Cologne demonstrated his sporting value in the past season: with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first game time as the topscorer of his club.
In the final match against Fenerbahce, he achieved the 1:0 winning score.
The newspaper "Fanatik" delighted him: "He was the best on the square."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup of his team.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season found a reconciling degree for the record master.
According to the pre-round K.o in the Champions League, the "lions" also divorced early in the Europa League.
In the Super Lig it was only ranking six.
The season wasn't good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
“We’ve done that and that’s the most important thing,” Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the game year was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who, with 26 seasonal matches, set the 14th title base as a Süper-Lig-Torroer King.
This is also the reason that fans continue to hope on the 31-year-old’s return.
Gomez, who was contracted with AC Florence, had only announced to Besiktas after the attempt to push to not return because of the political situation in the country after his EM vacation.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just needs to say it," the magazine "Kicker" quoted Club Chief Fikret Orman.
But the striker should be ready to renounce about a third of his estimated €7.5 million annual salary, Orman said: “We cannot pay his salary in Florence.”
Despite doping: These athletes still have medal opportunities at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was blocked twice because of doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblowerin Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other lightweight athletic sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals.
The theme of doping is still the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had complained her right to start shortly before the games, was mercilessly piped out and bought out at her launch (100 meters of breast).
It offered a ridiculous scenery: with an exposed smile she was still proud to the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When he found that she wasn’t going to get gold, the audience broke out into a joy storm.
However, there are many other athletes who are launching in spite of the doping past at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100 m stack/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in light athletics.
He was blocked twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic winner and former world champion run even faster than before, he is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the world's number one and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100 m stack/Jamaica): The twice Olympic winner and seven-fold world champion had to seat a six-month lock in 2010 after she was demonstrated to take the Oxycodon painkiller.
She had severe tooth pain after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (discussion/Croatia): in 2011, the Olympic winner from 2012, World Champion from 2013 and European Champions from 2010 to 2016 was positively tested on the prohibited stimulans fund Methylhexanamine.
Perkovic dismissed awareness and was blocked for six months.
This year’s four largest customers will go to the account of the great gold favourite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m stack/USA): The Beijing Olympic winner and twice world champion over 400 m, was positively tested in 2010 and blocked 21 months.
A means for penis enlargement was responsible, Merritt said.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 metres is the fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tichon (hammershot, Belarus): So many medals were later barely opened to an athlete.
So Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after it was detected testosterone doping.
The current 40-year-old had to give Olympic Silver in 2004 for steroid doping and the EM title in 2006 for testosterone abuse.
He received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympics on the basis of a judgment of the International Sports Court CAS.
At 80.04 m, he is ranked two of the world rank.
Liu Hong (20 km Walk, China): The world recorder and gold favourite was tested positively in May but can still start in Rio.
At the 29-year-old world champion, evidence of taking a prohibited dietary supplement was found, WADA’s World Anti-Doping Agency’s lock fell mild and running on July 13.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian wounded - Several deaths
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, spokesman of the Foreign Ministry, Thomas Schnöll, said Friday morning.
She suffered cut wounds and was treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave it again.
She planned her home trip for the beginning of September.
Whether Austrian citizens are also affected by the further explosions on the holiday Island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon, it is unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities, Schnöll said.
Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometers south of the capital of Bangkok, first exploded two bombs in an exhaust district on Thursday night.
According to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian woman, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday early two explosives rise again, according to the authorities, another person was killed.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion early.
During the detonation near the popular swimming beach among travellers Patong, a taxi driver was injured according to police reports.
In Surat Thani on the southeastern coast of the country then exploded another bomb that killed a city employee.
According to the authorities, the explosion replacement went into the air in a flower beet in front of the coastal police resort.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and in Chumphon on the southeast coast demanded several injured people.
It is a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
"The bomb attacks wear the same handwriting," Army General Danai Kritmethavee said Friday early before journalists.
“We assume that it is a coordinated attack.”
It was too early to express yourself on possible motives - however, it is probably about the acts of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks that is typical for the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising movement or international terrorism.
“This is only local sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provinces,” a spokesman in Bangkok said.
It is rather assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities had received intelligence reports of coming attacks in the south of the country, although they were not informed about the exact time and places.
I am not sure which group is behind the attacks.
Police announced its officials across the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and amusement districts.
There are always smaller bomb attacks in Thailand, but they usually do not address tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
According to the current bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry on its homepage recommends that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be followed.
High safety risk (safety level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
After disputes between security forces and Muslim populations, it is unsuggested for not necessary trips to these provinces.
Increased safety risk (safety level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the Military Junta.
This will give the military great influence in the coming years.
Junta Chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to chaos while the country moves towards stability, improvement in economic situation and tourism.
The Military Unta, who took power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, retains the benefit of leading the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has not succeeded in tackling the Muslim rebellion uprising in the extreme south of the country for years.
In the conflict, more than 6,500 people have been killed.
Almost a year ago, in Bangkok, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu writing, most of them foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack in the country’s younger history.
The right "Identitary Movement" has come into the vision of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
According to several national offices, the constitutional protectors have also put the group under observation.
“We are seeing points in the ‘Identitary Movement’ for efforts against the free democratic basic rule,” said Hans-Georg Maaßen, Chief Constitutional Protection Officer of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants from the Middle East or Islamic faith are defamed in a extremist manner.
That is why we also watch the movement.
The "Identitary Movement" is a grouping with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "multicultural wages", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of its own identity by overrainage".
Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - already observe the "identitarians".
Maassen said his authority has voted closely with the national offices in the decision.
“Groups like the ‘identitary movement’ try to pick up their target audience where they are standing,” the Constitutional Protection Chief said.
Usually, extremists try to talk to them with young language, often with poppy music.
Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.
This is not a beautiful advertising for your own thing.
The propaganda is intended to address people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Lastly, there had been reports from several federal countries on contacts of "identistics" to AfD politicians.
Maassen said he didn’t have any insights about it.
Possible contacts of this type are only relevant to the protection of the Constitution at a certain point.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - by certain extremists changes their target direction and becomes so extremist.
Therefore, it is crucial whether such persons have controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the significant increase in right-motived offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodations, Maassen said he would not yet speak of terrorism in this context.
But we have found in recent years that there can be legal terrorism structures.
There was the "Old School Society" group or the Freitaler group.
It may be that other legal terrorism groups or micro groups are formed that plan attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other right-extremist motives.
However, a German or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.
Maassen was concerned that many attacks went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects of attacks on asylum accommodation were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or right-wing supporters.
“So many people have committed offences who previously had nothing on the hat with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent or who have elected, for example, CDU, SPD or left, but who have then radicalized themselves by right-wing extremist mood matter.”
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes Internet hit
Not always the Olympics or World Records determine the headlines at the Olympics.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swimmed so slowly that he was no longer watching in the TV pictures.
It simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
On social networks, Habete was then converted to viral internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old, with a residue of 48 seconds, finished his precursion and ranked 59th of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not right sports figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian received a special right to start by the International Swimming Association.
This is distributed to make swimming more known in underrepresented countries.
Since most athletes are running in ethopies, they just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
The first names quickly made the round.
Some media called him the "robel of the whale."
In reference to a "wool-stand mouth", the English boulevard blade "The Sun" made fun about him with "Dad Bod".
His time, he only hit with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meters free style, didn’t matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani’s run gave media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to go alone in a run over 100 meters free style.
Freneticly, Moussambani was fired at the time.
The 22-year-old had only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretstried - The owner of a shop at the New Place has been undermined.
According to police, the 67-year-old Geretsrieder had left her business on Monday at 17.30 a.m. forgetting to close a window on the ground floor.
When they returned the next morning at 8:15 a.m., they disappeared from the cash around 250 euros.
The traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video monitoring.
Trump doesn’t see the threatening voting lack so narrow
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign event in Florida.
If it becomes nothing with the election of the U.S. president, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's going on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the U.S. presidential elections in November, he wouldn’t matter relatively: “Eventually it’s going to either fall or I have a very, very beautiful, long holiday,” the Republican candidate told CNBC in a telephone interview with the U.S. television broadcast.
If it doesn’t end up rich for him for reasons of political correctness, that’s okay, Trump said.
He referred to U.S. President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as the founder of the Islamic State Terror Military (IS).
Within his party, there was more and more resistance.
Post goes into the trade of electric transporters
An electrical supply vehicle from Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the companion is apparently great.
The post also plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter.
The company will soon start the trade with the transporter.
The post will also offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year.
“We want to enter in sale to third parties,” a post-speaker said on Friday.
The company has been examining for months whether it will be delivered to its own-developed street scooter with letters and packages to sell to other companies.
Post-Board Jürgen Gerdes had said there are repeated questions, such as craftsmen.
According to the news magazine "Der Spiegel" the Bonner Group will soon enter the mass production of the vehicles.
In its own manufacturing, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer.
Gerdes had announced that the company wants to significantly expand its fleet of electric cars and peel a complete shift to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long run.
“We’re going to take a very, very robust step towards 2020,” he said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we will change the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany’s roads since 2014.
GfK leadership declines after disappointing business numbers
The consumer research company GfK exchanges its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly, but not surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK made it suggest that the chair of Chief Executive Officer Matthias Hartmann is becoming more uncertain the longer the successes he promised.
Turbulence at the head of the Nürnberger Market Research Company GfK: After re-disappointing business figures and the resignation of the corporate management, the worldwide number Five of the industry is in front of a personal new start.
GfK Board Head wants to leave the company by the end of the year.
Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, is already departing from the Supervisory Board by 12 September.
The leadership in the Board took over on 1 September, previous Board member Gerhard Hausruckinger, the company said.
He is to officially take the function of a Board Speaker until a successor to Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the resignations, the company called "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
A company spokesman did not call details on Friday.
Whoever will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
In investor circles, on Friday, shareholders were last disappointment about the achievements of the restructuring launched years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK-Spice since 2011.
"The fruits of restructuring are not yet seen after five years," he said.
Given the last poor GfK business numbers, each shareholder will be disturbed at some point.
"If this was the case with BMW, the quantums would do that too," he said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss journey in the previous quarters, even in the second quarter of 2016.
At 361.2 million euros, the sales was 6.1 percent below the level of comparable previous year quarter.
Regarding the first half of the year, sales declined by 3.4% at 721.2 million euros.
In the second quarter, the company’s declined value was particularly burdened by the profits of the second quarter in the face of its difficult economic situation.
Consumer Experience’s corporate value deductions of 139 million euros led to a loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had still achieved a company profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus roaming in Krummhorns in Graben: Eight Injured
In an accident of a travel bus with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (Landdistrict Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, police said.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach, according to her information, had to escape a counter-track carrier who was partly on the counter-track.
The bus left to the right of the road and slipped into a grave, a police spokesman Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Due to the situation of the bus, people couldn't leave the bus independently," she said.
The firefighter released the prisoners.
Six rescue cars and a notary car arrived at the accident location on Landesstraße 2.
The uninjured travellers were brought back to the Pewsum district by a line bus.
There you should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company.
The investigators urged the laster driver and possible witnesses to contact the police.
The charges per cubic meter of wastewater are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the wastewater plant Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros (up to 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (up to 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After an overwhelming calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the household by the Land Country Office Kulmbach, it was found that the wastewater plants were found.
The Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the investments covered by legal basis.
As of October 1, 2016, citizens and the commercial and industrial companies of Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach their wallets deeper.
The charge increases are between 48 and 67%.
As manager Herbert Schmidt showed to the board, a recalculation of the charges for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.
In the period of October 2016 to September 2020, over- or under-covery should also be compensated from the previous calculation period.
The serious fee increases founded Schmidt that all three wastewater facilities have relatively small facilities with a very low wastewater attack, between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.
Thus, due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenditures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect.
Furthermore, the wastewater gain in all three plants is slightly decreasing.
Furthermore, in the previous calculation period, all three facilities have fallen to a significant extent not least due to their age of repair and repair expenditures.
The plant in Azendorf was almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp were almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged in the wastewater system Azendorf due to damage.
In the pump plant Welschenkahl, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor facilities had to be overcome from the ground, and after nearly 20 years of operation, Lopp had to be exhausted the first clearing shell, the clearing sludge was removed and an additional ventilation possibility to be installed in order to comply with the water requirements.
Schmidt: “These extraordinary expenditures were the continuous care and maintenance costs, which should be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period.”
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Stone houses made clear that during the low wastewater attack in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance “fullly go through”.
In addition, Schmidt said that the market community of large entertainment costs in wastewater plants have been saved over the past 20 years.
The situation for the above-mentioned plants will continue to remain precarious, in the view of stone houses, especially since the area of supply of the Friesenbachtal Wastewater Association cannot be expanded by these plants because it is deficit facilities.
Bulgaria recorded inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were recorded.
The average annual inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% according to the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since early this year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase was observed compared to the previous month of the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transportation (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices dropped in clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained unchanged as in the previous month of alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; as well as education.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticised as Asian Cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurd.
You can turn into an ananas, a dog, or a figure that could be painting from a Roy Lichtenstein.
The filters are unblooded, characteristic rotating tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All failures come to the public.
Snapchat filters have taken criticism in the past, in which they were accused that the app would promote Blackface or propagate white skin as a beauty-sideal.
This week, when it suggested a filter for some users that gave them scratch eyes, false teeth, and thinning cheeks, some critics called it a racial caricature of Asians - "yellow face".
They wondered whether these repeated controversy indicated a bigger problem that the company has diversity.
The news and resentment were widely used on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat reported that it would have disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced rassism reminded the filter of injuring cliches.
Others decisively rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely used about the photos, wrote that the filter was "injurious and gentlely said unpleasant."
She added that "it's difficult to argue with the countersetting of a very rebel Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow sight, but that the yellow face has been drawn into the devaluating extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural proud wires.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.
And Snapchat’s large audience of young people – who are more diverse in race than their older counterplayers – might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat’s filters generates an image that is offensive for a user, “it’s much harder that such things remain unnoticed than before,” 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes race-related controversy reflects a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership, and finished its essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either she has no different representation of people with other skin colours in her employment so that they can make such decisions," the Chinese-American Zhu said, "or they have people with other skin colours working there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its employment and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss its employees’ cultural backgrounds, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a staff member focusing on underrepresented populations and internal integration efforts.
Zhu said she will be shut down her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that isn't OK."
Military leadership misleading ISIS intelligence information, Congress Committee establishes
Military members of the United States Central Command changed news information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it would have allowed the actual states on site, a Congress investigation committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Army Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how supervisors changed their estimates of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“News service information, typically dismissed by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly drawn a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than the actual on-site states had allowed and were more positive than analyzes of other news services,” a newspaper said in a statement.
"What happened to Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-side report shows in detail consistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the formation of Iraqi armed forces.
Although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama gave instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to the pressure of their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many central command press releases, opinions, and statements before the Congress were significantly more positive than it corresponds to the facts," the report said.
For example, a Centcom publicly announced that a military recovery of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," said Mike Pompeo, a Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command’s leads changed the news service reports to reduce the risk of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports about the Islamic State.
The report published Thursday will still be completed by more detailed insights while the investigations will continue.
Furthermore, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
On Thursday, democratic members of the Intelligence Service Committee published their own insights, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
“In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an over-limited process for the preparation of news assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services,” the highest-level Democrat in the Committee, member of the Representative House, Adam B. Schiff, announced in a statement.
This process, says Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of news service reports," damaged the morality among analysts and "gave too little space for differing opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they have not found any evidence of the White House’s intervention with Centcom analysts regarding a “determined political opinion”.
The provisional results of the Congress’s investigation were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon General Inspector, which were recorded according to Centcom analysts’ complaints.
Lt. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defence would not comment on Congress reports while the investigations of the General Inspector were still underway.
But he also said that “experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defense.”
The investigations have repercussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now made by a growing number of defence departments).
However, last year’s accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest estimates of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Critics regarding secret information about the Islamic State reminds of disputes more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper about how the government under George W. Bush, in contrast to the recommendations of many analysts, only had a small occupational force in Iraq, and little time to think about the consequences of the invasion in 2003.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to government agencies, noted that, in contrast to the statements of the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State, did not have significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group as these provisional refineries had taken into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this discovery was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's at the time commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislative because of his excessively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votell at the Central Command.
The US wins fourth match in Women's Field Hockey, showdown with Britain
One day after she shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American women's field hockey team in a match against India on Thursday that the Americans won at 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn’t remember ever doing it.
"I have no idea," she said.
I am not one of the people who keep their gates in memory.
She knows, however, that the American women are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are at the same time on the first place in their group with the British women who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet each other on Saturday in the last match of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-final, the game will decide which of the two teams within their group from six teams will be first and second.
The first placed will leave the strong Dutch women a little longer, leading the other group.
Whatever the game may happen on Saturday, American girls have triggered a surprising vertebrae through their success story, four years after landing at the last London Games on the last of 12 places.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and the first time she had a hockey racket in hands at the age of three (her two older sisters played sport at Drexel University), she became the US national player at the age of 16, the latest in the history of the team.
She missed the Olympics in 2008, as she could not qualify for the chair.
Then came the year 2012 where everything was wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team, began to turn to better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the workplace in London that we have now.
We've been able to completely crack the roller around.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torregen in the first half of the game with a back-up from the nearby area.
India went into the game without winning in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tearing and held the match from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and lumped the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 guide.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the U.S. gate guardian, Jackie Briggs, who so far had to account for a gate in each of the previous games.
She's running.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good position," Parnham said, but how well it will depend on the result of the next match on Saturday.
In the middle of the rage of the Olympic Games, the zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it’s the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel consistent and inevitable, a racing seasonal run between competition and efforts.
It’s as if the Olympic faucet himself is a burning rod, which is given from the arm brust sniper to the swimmer to the turner to the triathlete.
You cannot turn on the television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor’s waitbox in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is the first time at the Olympic Games and is a women’s slaughter, could have been among these well-known names sent to the Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-sensing TV advertising if he was a swimmer, turner, or even fetter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournaments.
The Olympic flame does not light every event the same.
Further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, bow shooting, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have breast swimming and maybe it reigns for a long time.
But if I have to make modest arguments for my particular beloved, then let me draw attention to the discrete charm of trampoline.
Although the trampoline leap has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it debuted in Sydney, it has been so scarcely perceived over the past 16 years that many of the ones I had questioned did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. has sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a trampoline medal and had an athlete who has achieved it until the final round by 2012.
The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for men, Chinese and Canadians that for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jump has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than that for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an earthly enthusiast.
It has a humorous potential – the cartoon trembling of his wanting to never end – but also the grace of turn and diving, the two sports that essentially combine it.
The word "trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "jumping board."
Emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet into the air, and need a series of dropping movements (slips, hikes and salts) before they land on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic program by execution, difficulty degree and "flight time".
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will face each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hopes have to continue in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and above, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and back, up and down on the playground.
They hunt not only the target line or the starting wall, but also in the television broadcast another ugly goal: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The targeted strive is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to touch even a viewer to tears.
But it’s also what I feel tired when watching these games myself.
The trampoline offers a breakthrough.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A movement forward is not the goal.
He or she crashes, seemingly heavily like an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
There is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolfs in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.
Women’s qualifications and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; men’s rounds on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will emit the end rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 a.m.
In the middle of the Olympic Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, which will probably be overlooked in general.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the anguish and objectivity of male athletes - as the US male turns recently suggested according to the Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new, air-clinging membership.
"A Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, Long an American Allied
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia encountered the government’s violent resistance.
Witnesses say that several protesters were killed during the clashes with the police during shooting changes.
Is Ethiopia just going to break down?
In the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally in the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months protests against the government have shaken the country and expanded into more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s response was unmerciful.
Witnesses said police shot and killed hundreds of unarmed demonstrators.
Videos about the protests that are likely to be from the last or early year show how security people beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority now requires a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, project manager of the African Horn of the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is Nigeria’s most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. Only few countries in Africa, if any, get so much Western assistance.
Ethiopia’s economy expanded in considerable tempo.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new pendel train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was nothing but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued to lead the government's oppression - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or in prison, killed or driven into the wilderness.
But that could change.
“If you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out,” said Seyoum Teshome, a faculty in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protests.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground use to wipening in terms of the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now controlled 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions rise along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this shocky, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogade National Liberation Front, who have been more or less forced in recent years, could exploit turbulence and rearm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding under the surface after years of earlier throwing.
The first one seems harmless: smartphones.
In recent years, very many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, since cheaper smartphones have become increasingly frequent and Internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do regularly, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they stay.
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since eons, the Amharas, who come from mostly Christian highlands of Ethopians, have prospered in politics and economics while exploiting the oromos of which many are Muslims and live in flatland areas.
But that also changes right now.
“We are working to coordinate under a screen,” said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests were held in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, who represent about 6% of the population and who are dominant in military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the trouble is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia’s Prime Minister for 17 years until his death of an unpublished disease in 2012.
He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.
Analysts say he was especially aware of seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special representatives to edit opponents and make them harmless.
“The current regime lacks this basic skill,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new prime minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively untransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by Tigray.
Many worry that the result will be more blood shedding.
The last time that Ethiopia experienced such an uprising was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which were apparently blown up by the government and then stolen, according to analytics.
During the following races, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in recent months and this time of trouble was relatively quickly over.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pendel train, and for their measureable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal misconsciousness of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked businesses in Gondar, an Amharian city led by Tigray, and hatred towards the Tigray becomes increasingly common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a strange position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in a already volatile area.
"This," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very thin grat migration."
Donald Trump says Obama founded ISIS "Sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump attempted to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday by claiming that his repeated claims, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the “founder” of the terrorist group of Islamic State, had not been serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Republicans, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandable with the American public.
It also brings its co-strieders who strive to take him in protection during an event-rich phase, to have to explain in the unique position statements that he could not have meant.
After making the suggestion at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump recalled on Thursday’s claim and in interviews insisted that he really did not intend to say that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in a early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews he said the accusation was completely serious.
When Conservative Radio Moderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it.
The last storm of criticism declines on Mr. Trump while he tried to focus his campaign because of dropping survey values on the economic situation.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue again.
He warned on Twitter that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already introduced Sarcasmus to his defense.
At the end of July he took strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton’s emails, but later he explained “Of course I meant sarcastic.”
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then turn back if needed.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans, how they arrive, and then, if appropriate, "claify" depending on how the reaction fails," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert watching the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of decreasing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more exciting tone as his survey values have declined further.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a guided tour in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he frequently accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is increasingly focused on attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump’s jokes have brought his loyal counterparts into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him, regardless of how provocating his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump’s most prominent speakers, made a great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," Giuliani said, so he was asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It’s true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backboneklers, completely wrong and that’s why it happened because he removed the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as a foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread by ceasing aggressively controlling the situation in the Middle East.
Before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and argued them to walk around on each of his words and be preconceived against him.
He mocked the "poor, shameful" television experts trying to understand him and said, "You can't!"
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump’s apology as just another evidence that he was inappropriate for the presidential office.
Once the price is removed from the market, café returns in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a big cafe in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash that did not have Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices were removed from its Bedford Avenue shop front.
The Soap Cherie store, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Native people dealt with it as the last loss in a gentling city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is except, and Verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is change, then it is also new invention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good too.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café.
He began working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide money for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.
Verb uses the same distributor for the Bagels purchased the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnitures such as capers and sucked onion.
There are natural rice bottles.
The café doesn't serve beer anymore, there are fresh juices for it.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady electricity of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also driven out from Williamsburg by prices," he said.
Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer on a Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the way.
After the verb closed, she dropped coffee drinking for a while, she said.
"I became clear that it was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even though she ordered a blended chai tea on that day instead of her usual Iced Coffees, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and always ordered the same.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my everything bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and pick up new ingredients into the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he wasn’t angry about the soap business took up the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered a special soap for verb with the cold-burned coffee of the café as an ingredient.
“I think we’ll still take on her offer,” Rodriguez said.
And the traditional, Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to release it soon, so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The site also has other advantages.
A local juice site wants to fill and sell the cold-burned coffee into the bottles.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the location and ordering a new coffee felt like a homeback.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a fine flavor, President Roosevelt had a low for refined Fifth Avenue delights such as Paste de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on that day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and as a dessert a plum pudding.
“It was a culinary act of solidarity with suffering people,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes’ last book “Chop Suey” dealt with Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Brickman tells about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective in his book “97 Orchard”.
Their latest collaboration, "A Decent Meal", which will appear on Tuesday in the Harper publishing, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed a culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snorkelless imbecil in the Flatiron District that has already been in the shop since the exchange crash in 1929.
Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, eaten turtle with potato pures and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, this found the couple suitable for a discussion about food in the era of the Great Depression.
"Rich foods were very popular," Brickman said.
There was nose bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from one ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many nuts that they serve as a dinner.
Coe laughs.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pastes were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" recorded the ways the country was circumventing to no longer be the slapland.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for Americans," Coe said why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Similarly, the new budget diet was stressed: mysterious foods such as breads and casserolls became basic foods, the casseroll as "wonderful way to reuse food remains," Tigelman noted, as cooks could hide inappetite ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.
Extraordinary mixtures were tried as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen comprehension.
During their research for the book, which also includes recipes, Brickman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with nozzle butter.
“It wasn’t a popular addition in the lunch,” says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues to say, "It was surreal."
Nut butter and baked onions do not fit each other.
It was typical for many of the household recipes.
Like never before or since, household economists – including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 – have forced the country’s eating habits like this.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “budget policymakers” and to meet the challenge of transforming pampes like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical tastes.
Especially tasteful are the reports on the government’s response to the hungry citizens, as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Cake-Essen-Haltung.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen, he fed like the millions of heavy man of the world to whom he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in a nearly golden dining room and wearing a smoking.
He was beautifully alien.
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake unless his wife Eleanor had asked him to rule an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, hiring a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comfortlessly prepared.
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression to deal with food were rejected as soon as the country returned to its legs.
The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, Brickman said, as well as how science was applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple gave the better understanding of the eating habits of Brickman’s mother-in-law – for example, how she couldn’t throw food away.
“She was afraid of wasting food,” Coe said.
Brickman remembered, "He actually made people sick."
There was the wind bag incident.
After the dishes were removed at Eisenberg's, they and Coe draw out a dessert they had prepared at home: the flavour dessert, President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip," Brickman said, adding that it was a common trick to miss a nice name.
There was no beaten cranes, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone had somewhat reluctantly dipped a spoon in the brown teeth.
Amazingly, it didn’t taste badly.
Coe got a survey three times.
Like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "A couple hacked walnuts would help."
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He played his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others.
Now the 30-year-old died even in a bomb attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civilian protective group that, according to Bild-News Magazine, has previously saved almost 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers play their own lives to draw people from bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war area.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civilian protector showing him in a 11-hour rescue of a baby from the ruins of a house, moved around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a bright symbol in the gray of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, according to the picture, “This is the real jihad for me.”
"When I die to save life, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombing attacks in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four fass bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffer from breath impairment.
“We are now eliminating the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don’t play with it,” the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists.
Greenland: The oldest spinal animal is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland hairs usually come to the surface only in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims well 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland’s hairs are only childhood at age 150.
In an average hour, the Greenland shay swims along the base of the northern Atlantic, and it is only 1,220 meters away.
Only when it comes to it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a saddle of 2.6 km/h - and with this maximum speed is half as fast as a robbery.
However, this lifestyle, characterized by slowness, seems to be a patent concept for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" from a Greenland hai that might be 392 years old.
Alexander Scheuerlein, from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, comments on this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebral animals.
Although evolutionary biologists have long suspected that Greenland’s hairs will be stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, ultimately they live mainly in the Eismer front of the thinly populated coastlines of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergs.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
About the lifestyle of Greenland’s hairs, researchers are very little known.
They measured their time-lupe speed when they equipped six animals with a broadcast in front of Spitzbergen.
In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remnants of a robbery, another had swallowed the pine bone of a young ice bear.
Perhaps they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the squirrel and seek cadaver that turns down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks, which fishermen from 2010 to 2013 came from the depth of the North Atlantics in front of Greenland or Spitzbergen.
The smallest shark was just 81 inches long, while the largest 502 inches measured.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lente core of the shark using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sharks, and the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had stunning lots of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts dropped larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, in the 3rd smallest animal with 220 centimeters of length, the lens core contained a small excess of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons attempts, so it might have celebrated its 50th birthday during its 2012 investigation.
On the other hand, all the larger Greenland hairs had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens core, which were caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimeters long Greenland hai showed an age of 335 years, while the record hai with 502 centimeters could be even 392 years old.
It was known that Grönland hair feminines were only getting offspring until they are longer than four meters.
Now the researchers of the length were able to assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably at the threshold to the gender maturity and its age was determined at 156 years of age, Greenland’s hairs with the multiplication can obviously be at least one and a half centuries of time.
This is expected to be a world record for vertebral animals.
The fact that such methods are living above all in icy waters is not a chance.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland Wall, whose bacon had a 120-year-old harpun tip on the neck, was also captured in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures often also the organism of the animals living there runs on spare flame.
So they mature later - and age slower.
To keep warm in the cold water, the animals also often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than for one gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
“So a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having many descendants as soon as possible,” explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal should invest its resources in a long lifetime.
Building ground in double pack
At the recent meeting, the municipal council has focused on the issues of construction.
With ease, the Board accepted Mayor Robert Putz’s announcement that “the marketing of the newly designated residential areas can finally begin.”
Having been able to clarify the questions of land, parcellation and exploitation and the applications for measurement, the sale of the land in the residential building areas "Straßweg" and "Schönau-West" (Region Binderstraße - Expansion Section 1) is nothing more in the way.
The municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau are equally addressing young families and seniors.
As said, volunteers can report to the City Hall from now on, the municipal council is expected to advise on the award of the parcels in its September meeting.
In order to also be able to meet requests for the settlement of other businesses, in connection with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to change the plan for land use that was newly created in the spring of this year.
Thus, the commercial area already designated there is expanded by two parcels to the direction of Staatsstraße 2112 in the subterm larn area.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city on Main has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies relocated from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
“It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote,” says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW’s financial markets and real estate markets.
According to the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate financial transactions across the EU from London.
To date, the so-called EU pass is enough for them to be admitted in the UK.
This is just using large US banks.
Several banks have already announced to move jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10000 new jobs in the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the eurozone, as well as other major authorities such as European insurance supervision EIOPA and the ESRB.
Although the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important to the financial sector than the ECB.
“The proximity to the bank is important for banks as they can so directly communicate with the supervision,” says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg is in a large funding industry, it cuts worse in the infrastructure as well as Dublin.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
Furthermore, the city points with easily available commercial properties.
“In Paris, it’s not so easy to find free high-quality offices,” says Voigtländer.
On Seine, the rentals for top-class commercial real estate are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
Frankfurt also offers higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure, as well as less crime.
In a ranking of the Mercer Business Advisory, the city is placed seventh, Luxembourg is placed 19th, Dublin is placed 33th and Paris is placed 37th.
Even though quality of life is a matter of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," the IW concludes.
But despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial center in Europe, the economic researchers say.
In London, according to the numbers of the Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015, and in Frankfurt were 62,500.
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
An U.S. official judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs arising from the Hepatitis C dispute with pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a $200 million damage payment for the injury of two Merck patents, which were associated with the Blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after an American judge revealed a pattern of misconduct by Merck, including falsehood and other unethical actions.
On Thursday, U.S. Official Court Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead had the right to declare the costs arising during the defense of the case.
Merck tries to identify Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck accused each other and took property on laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s drugs.
US-backed troops say they have returned full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
U.S.-backed troops have returned full control over the northern town of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last ISIS fighters left it, a group spokesman said Friday.
Syria’s Democratic Forces (DKS) are currently came through the city after the extract of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish told the Manbij Military Council allied with the DKS Reuters.
“The city is now under full control, but we’re just doing cleaning,” he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her tax declaration for 2015 on Friday, which revealed an income of $10.75 million for the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clinton’s $1 million donated for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated almost $5.3 million in Redehonorares; former Foreign Minister gave a $3 million income from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton’s Vice-Presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton published his tax statements for the past ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set financial transparency standards," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri announced in a statement.
Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdrawals in terms of his previous promises to publish his tax declarations.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have stated a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"They're on the train," Clinton's campaign helper Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Trump’s special advisor Michael Cohen told CNN he would not allow Trump to publish something before tax audits are completed.
Trump’s critics, among other things also the Republican Presidency Candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already stated that his refusal to launch questions regarding assets, his donations to charitable organizations, his businessable, and various other connections, particularly with Russia.
Clinton has already crashed on the topic and on Friday published a video on the Internet, in which high-level Republican Trump calls on to publish his tax declaration.
On Thursday, she spoke on the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declarations," she told the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no taxes for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors on Friday that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a rule named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would make sure people earning more than $1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska asked Buffett whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has its headquarters here to exchange Trump for a meeting on their tax declarations.
Buffett said he was also undergoing a tax audit at the IRS and Trump had "anxiety" before the voters and not the tax authorities.
Clinton’s campaign has published tax declaration back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5%.
Clinton’s 2015 tax declaration showed that they only received $100 of their income as a salary, unlike the majority of Americans.
Their main investment was a cost-effective index fund, from which Clinton’s dividend and revenues were taxed by $109,000.

Condoms with chilipuders, fireworks promote Tanzania elephant protection
Nature protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw condoms filled with chilipuds on them.
The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea of it years ago, has intensified their promotion together with the US Nature Protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a violent four-step method to protect their homes and harvest without injuring animals.
Previously, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is the World Elephant Day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the Toolkit, we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, while they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant," said Honeyguide Managing Director Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a faucet and the bubble in a horn.
If he is not scared, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is turned up to the ignition rope.
When it is ignited, the condom breaks up with a crack and sprays fine dust on chilipouders into the air.
A touch is usually already out to hunt the elephant.
One last possibility is a warrior who shoots a gold rainfire plant into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council decides unanimously: No kiosk new construction at St. Goarer Rheinufer
Usually, St. Goarer’s investment projects are considered to be considerably able to expand the retail in the core town.
The request for the new construction of a sales kiosk on the Rheinufe near the Rheinbalkon being built, however, was now unanimously rejected by the city council.
"We generally welcome new traders, but at this site in an exhibited location on the Rhineland side, this kiosk doesn't fit," said Hubrath to the CDU Group.
Jewish director breaks down Berliner Hotel because Israeli code was removed after "arabic" invitation - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media break after he had told that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has not listed any Israeli pre-code as it would have "appealed to Arab guests," according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah" released his trouble at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel’s country code list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to choose Israel via its own call center.
After an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the action was "an intentional decision of the management of the Kempinski hotel."
The reason that stood behind it turned out even more anger in the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the code be deleted," Lanzmann said.
The Israeli ambassador in Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called this a "big shame," the Süddeutsche Zeitung reports.
We were shocked and shocked by this event.
This is really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame.
That doesn't need any explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident caused a fairly large resonance on the internet, where people called the whole a scandal.
Some submitted to the Kempinski Hotel that it would have "submitted" to the alleged calls of Arab guests.
"Shame you," said in another post that it was noted that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly announced all the accusations of itself and called the incident a "mistake" and "apologised" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
“There was never a direct instruction to do not include Israel in the quick choice list,” the Süddeutsche Zeitung cited a spokesman of the Kempinski hotel.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber shots against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian town of Sao Paulo when they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber shots against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers attempted to dissipate students, leading to the police use of rubber shots and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their fear about the plans.
According to the proposals of governor of the state of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, less than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protest participants saw graffiti spray on walls against the preliminary President Michel Temer.
The recent protests took place a few days after mass demonstrators went to the streets to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been dismissed by a vote of the Senate for her revocation from the office.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increases to 71% - RT Business
With the revocation of the sanctions, according to Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade sales between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9% in the year compared.
Since the international sanctions against Iran have been abolished, Russian companies’ interest in businesses in the country has grown strongly, the ambassadors said.
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade sales between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and was $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran rose by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade recovery was achieved by delivery of machines, land vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan is a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation issued about 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries regarding the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken last year," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes that it will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd that have retained monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witnesses searched: Drinking market attacks in Forestbrunette
A robbery was committed on Thursday night on the drinking market by Rewe XXL on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
With a firearm, three dark dressed persons who had mugged their faces demanded the output of cash from the employees of the beverage market and then first fled on foot and then probably with a silver-colored VW golf.
How much money was taken, the police don’t tell.
The perpetrators were supposed to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters in height, which is relatively small.
The beverage market is accessible directly from the park deck of the Rewe market and poorly viewable.
The perpetrators must, after the attack, run towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and have fled the silver-colored car, possibly towards B 256 (slader ring).
Anyone who made observations related to the robbery at the time of the act (from 19:45 a.m.) should urgently report to the police.
Nagold: Game and fun at summer free time
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and teenagers of the social educational group/social group work of the Child Protection Federation Nagold with their caregivers at their summer free time in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet recreational house Hardtwaldle, the lifefriendly group was embedded during the first school holiday week.
Several full-day excursions were on the program.
On the first hand, it went to boards with the visit to the stitching zoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special child guidance in the world-famous monastery.
The third excursion led to Pforzheim.
At the Kelt Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned much about the daily life and food of the Kelts.
In the hot days, the group enjoyed the deep lake in Maulbronn, which invited to jump, swim and plane.
Children and caregivers were culinary with their self-prepared body meals such as the Sauren Lateschle, the Seebronner Pönne, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful jewelry was created from pearls and stones or made from wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "Bundle Night".
On the day of the trip home, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned satisfiedly.
Haigerhoch: pilgrims to the gate of mercy
The ministers from Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on a four-day pilgrimage journey from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were managed together.
To overlap the time until the next ministerial road trip in two years is expected, the Senior Minister’s round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various parish objectives were examined and finally decided for the Bishop town of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered with the open gate of mercy at Freiburg Münster.
16 minis from Bitterbronn, Gruol, Haigerhole and Holy Rooms went on the way.
In the evening before, the priest Storost sent the pilgrims out in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims crosses and granted the pilgrims blessings.
From Horb was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where also stands a Munster of Our Dear Lady and thus the pilgrimage trail was reached from Munster.
The individual day tours were ever framed by a short impulse in the morning and evening with different prayers, songs and writings.
But even on the road, the minis made field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly rast to sing a song of a singing pilgrimage house.
For the nights, the parish homes of the local parishes were available.
At the stage targets, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day it went on Furtwangen nach Gütenbach.
The next day, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most stressful route, had to drop about 500 meters of height at the start and then re-close.
The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the bathroom.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in St. Peter’s imposing monastery church, it went to the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly, the Minis entered the later afternoon on Freiburger Münster and passed through the gate of mercy.
With a little impulse, we thanked God here.
At the evening trade fair in Munster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by cooperator Markus Obert.
After worship, the pilgrims were able to visit the Sacristy and the High Altar.
The next day it was still time for the Breisgaumetropolis.
In the afternoon, the train went back to Horb.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were characterized by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Schotte Callum Skinner storms home when Britain wins gold for cycling
Scotland’s Callum Skinner launched last night at the men’s team sprint at Velodrome in Rio to the glory when the British team defended London’s title in 2012.
The 23-year-old girl from Glasgow took the anchor role his countryman Sir Chris Hoy made the legend proud when he stormed home to win from the favorite New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after they won only a modest sixth place at the railway World Championships in London in March despite the resignation of Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time when hinds appeared.
Hoy’s retirement generated a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed in when they saw potential in the Scottish that has now developed.
Indeed, Kenny, who won with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
But after his round, Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A strategy change made a large part of the transformation, where Hindes went in a higher gang to slow him down and enable Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they climbed to the podest.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a sweet comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make my name.
We set up an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the World Champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the Triumph 2012 on Kennys and Hoys side, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the train.
He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection from England’s rivals.
With such a surprising victory, this time there was no such problem.
Hinds said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags on the tribune."
We have come together as a team in the last three months.
We have gone so badly on so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which was won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we are expecting successful five days in Velodrome.
With the form of Kenny, it is possible to repeat Hoy’s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a apparent holy date for British sport; on that day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - an output of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the one of Hoy.
Kenny will take part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two other gold medals, he should be beaten as a knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.
They arrived at 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) takes place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be focused.
He had argued with representative before the qualification yesterday when he calls to himself to measure his body size.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in the World Record Time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and pick up a bunch of medals.
After a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio have been declined.
Dramas were played in the background, so the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April in the middle of sexism and mobbing allegations, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, when you look at the first evening of the competition in Velodrome, it seems like the legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its highlight at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
The future of the melting of Portland is questionable due to the abolition of the energy agreement
The future of Portland’s aluminum melting in Victoria – as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs – is at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus terminate all the supply contracts, as the supplier said.
This step followed the Government’s decision in Victoria early this year not to grant additional subsidies to the operation of the plant.
A 20-year grant will expire in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk when closing.
Furthermore, domino effects could occur as melting consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total power generation.
2014 Alcoa closed the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa’s melting company in Portland loses money and risks closure.
This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and lastly due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum melting company with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it is expected that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is mostly owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubini Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL is expecting the plant to continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity by melting," the company said.
AGL continued to state that the contracts are so-called “security transactions” that should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month warning period, so they will end in 2017.
"AGL is therefore assuming that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17," the electricity supplier said.
All potential impacts on AGL revenues from GJ 18 are currently limited by the predictions of strong date markets for wholesale current prices.
AGL announced that it had already decreased the value of the contracts in its annual decline of $187 million in "expecting a cancellation".
Alcoa said that the decision to exempl the contracts, the "Alcoas ability... to operate melting or to ensure power supply to melting" does not impair.
The U.S. company said it had entered into a 20-year treaty with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force since November this year, even if it is still a guilty statement why it resigned from the treaty.
Due to the poor economic conditions of the industry, analytics warn about the possible closure of the Portland melting in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In reference to the analysts’ statements early this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatt and Tomago around 900 megawatt electricity annually.
If both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the electricity market.
And for us as a generator, this wouldn’t be good,” he said.
More than just one Kardashian Reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and running on Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to cry," Kendall wrote.
The revelation of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problems Rob and Caitlyn, and in the presence of the all-sided most popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), they have forgotten the classical and wester
This represents almost every birthday episode of a child shipment (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You thought we would have forgotten you?") with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a broadcasting place at 8am in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls somehow participate in this publicity.
With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's large sister Kim likes she's beaten about the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were seeing it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for herself.
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a circumference that is more similar to a picture tape than a fashion magazine, the edition attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were advertising from the 832 pages of the Walzer 615 pages).
The revelation of his coverstar is so desired that pictures of the magazine have been surrounded in the last two years before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, more “famous models” have been clearly on the cover than “famous models.”
Oscar prize winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga was honored.
But even with the low chance that Mrs. Jenner - which is described by the magazine as the "model of breakthrough" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good society.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even if everything is true to Jenner).
They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course, Jenner’s success doesn’t like everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner’s position in the fashion world was always somewhat stressed.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the fucking pieces of the moment."
These feelings cooked up again when the message came out with Jenner’s appearance on the Vogue Cover.
But walking around the misunderstanding seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the Vogue's September edition.
In the true sense of the word, she is a supermodel.
It's going for Marc Jacobs.
It makes advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
You and all your sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her free time, she's watching on Reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Commonwealth law centres denied 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country’s most aid needs are denied annually by community law centers, while the industry is focused on the impact of further fund cuts on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older persons, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence, and those who do not have any means of unjust delocation and similar - are already denied in their requests for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already excessively loaded, are ready for further cuts.
From June next year, it is expected that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
Queesland’s Director of Common Law Centers James Farrell said the final survey of the National Association of Common Law Centers found that thousands of people are already rejected every year.
Farrell said the situation would only be worse without repealing the federal government’s decision.
“Queensland’s municipal law centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people will be rejected from important services you need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with inconceivable and oppressive debt, families who go through separations, workers who have been unfairly released - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent, which means thousands of more needy people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call upon the Federal Attorney General and Federal Minister of Justice and Queensland senators George Brandis to immediately remove these funds shortings so that people can get the assistance they need in legal issues.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raising funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the community law centers and their customer communities, as well as that the government of Palaszczuk invests in this important work.
Donald Trump's election campaign charged with employees supposedly pulled weapon
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been accused of alleged inactivity after she was informed that her North Carolina campaign leader has directed a gun to a staff while traveling in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an accusation filed on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini announced waiting for months that the matter would be governed internally before he realized that "that would not happen."
The campaign manager, Earl Philip, "took a gun, laid his right-wing finger on the removal, and ramped the run in Vincent's kneekel," Bordini said in his accusation.
After complaining with the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini noted that at least four others had already had the same experience with Phillip, he announced in the charge.
“Weapons don’t have to be fired to cause damage,” Bordini said.
The charge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered an uprising when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - gun owners and arms friends - should take action if his Rival Hillary Clinton was elected and appointed judges.
Trump’s campaign cleared that the media had broken his words out of the context and that he would not steal to violence.
Bordini’s complaint requires damage from the campaign for the violation of care obligation and by Philip for injury to body and persistent soul damage.
Trump’s press spokesman Hope Hicks was not reached for a comment.
Trying to contact Philip failed as well.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
Innovative Consulting Services has not responded to the calls of his advisory company.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Oberstes Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Country elections survey: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal countries Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) there are significant losses for the SPD and CDU government parties.
This resulted in representative surveys of the INSA Opinion Research Institute for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition could continue to rule in the north, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both federal countries, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would therefore have good opportunities to continue to put the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD dropped from 35.6% five years ago to 24%.
According to the survey, the party is just ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23%.
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left would be 19% (previously 18.4%), the AfD would be represented at 19% for the first time in the Landtag.
Despite light losses, the Greens return to the Heavy Land Day, with 6% (previously 8.7%).
NPD and FDP would not be represented at 3 percent in the Landtag.
According to the Berlin House Election, the SPD would only be 23% (Votes in 2011: 28.3%).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4%.
It is still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6%), but left with 15 percent (previously 11.7%).
The AfD would be represented at 14 percent for the first time in the House of Parliament.
At 5%, the FDP could hope to return, but the pirates would miss the retreat in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The First Smartphone
Email and Internet in timelupe: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The successors today dominate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and larger, so it wasn’t good in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was quite clobious.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would suffice for approximately two selfies with high resolution today.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The Nokia 9000 Communicator came to the stores exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they come somehow from the stone age of the Internet age.
20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish cell phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer trade fair in Hannover as "Office in west pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could have a lot for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax was to reach the communicator.
Even access to websites was possible through HTML browsers, although slowly tormented.
A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the cell phone could be folded similar to a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, which is about 1400 euros.
The average price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one could suggest in August 1996 that the communicator would become the start of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything is different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finnish cell phone section experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually sold and dealt with to Microsoft.
Today, the market is dominated by suppliers, who all came much later than Nokia.
Being online everywhere and everywhere, this is today for many people everyday life.
In 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Approximately 1.4 billion devices were sold, with Samsung and Apple alone 555 million pieces.
The worldwide revenue with the devices is around 400 billion euros.
This includes the well-running businesses of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
Around the smartphone has now emerged a whole industry.
The crucial breakthrough to the mass market came until early 2007, then Apple chief Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone on the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone, and an internet communicator to easily use everything via touch screen.
Apple’s victory started, but today the iPhone is the most important product of the company.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, have been looking forward.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The saying now has Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung.
The smartphone is an obvious 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his cell phone 88 times a day.
“We all have to learn to take the smartphone off once,” said Janina Kugel, responsible for staff at the Siemens Board.
Permanent accessibility is now considered as a curse and blessing at the same time.
England has to drive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will not only bring renewal and prosperity to our local municipalities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as in 2012 in London, when we worked a great deal to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great advantages to Stratford and East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new teachings, create 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think the challenge of Heathrow’s expansion is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blame ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong with Heathrow too.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question asked him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Extension is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in scientific growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment to both the airport and throughout the GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented an expensive £11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - which was chosen five years in a row as the world’s best airport terminal, to T2, which was built in the midst of the two most frequented running path in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third track, which is supported by £16 billion in private investments.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It’s time to drive this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" relating to ad blocking
For companies making money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to avoid ad blocking are equal to a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockages on its desktop page, Adblock Plus released a blog post that said users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change coding relating to its advertisements to make it harder to recognize which part of the page advertising is.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to overcome the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock’s spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of struggle between the ad blocking open source community and the rebels has already been in progress since the invention of display blockers,” and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has entered into the struggle is a strong indication of how concerning display blockers have become for the industry.
According to a recent study from Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use ad blockers worldwide, almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenues.
The company has no effect on ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook’s mobile social network app and Instagram, a spokesman said.
Advertising on desktop PCs makes up enough of revenue, so Facebook seems to invest such a step worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "advertising preferences" tool to have people more control over advertising targeted on them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters would be concerning because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
“For users this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem,” a spokesman from Facebook said in an email message.
Ad blockers are a stubborn means, which is why we have focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to place more control in people’s hands.
Woman surpassed on Swiss highway in presumably suicide
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call for witnesses after a woman was passed over in the early morning on Thursday in a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down on the street in the dark "in an act of despair" and were hit by several cars, the police in Waadt said.
It is obvious that a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was driven by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She still died on site.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have not yet been identified, police said, which asked them and every witness of the incident to report.
An investigative proceedings were opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
However, it remains to wait to see if one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision preventable?
That’s something the prosecutor has to decide,” said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not taken responsibility.
In each of the two cases - in which a person runs in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs on the highway in the middle of the night, as it was called in the newspaper.
Last year, a policeman of negligent killing was released after surviving and killing a man who was on the A1 one night near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drinked and became unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court noted that the police officer -- who had responded to an emergency call -- conducted in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was "a perfect exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has more information about the incident near Morges on Thursday should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could once have shown conditions similar with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-density atmosphere.
Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow turning of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that the Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly turned on.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably posed more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to host life and protected from faster evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow turning of the Venus exposes its day side of the sun for almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like a parasol to shield the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than Earth today.
The model brought out a story of the Venus, which resembles the evolution previously suspected by planet researchers.
Although it was once probably inhabitable, the Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over multiple billion years.
Their oceans diluted and their water steam was burned away from ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen removed, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy returned as Coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations at Colorado Avalanche on Thursday and introduced too low co-determination rights in the team’s decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately search for a new trainer.
“In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and certainty,” the 50-year-old Roy said in a statement.
Over the course of the summer, I’ve thought a lot about how to improve this team to give him more depth, that needs it and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the trainer and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization.
He must also have a co-determination right in decisions that affect the team’s performance.
These terms are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions for the team.
“Patrick informed me of this decision today,” Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was awarded the league's best coach during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14 winner of the Jack Adams Award.
He led the club to 112 points and to the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of Minnesota playoffs and missed the post-season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and dropped behind the Wild for a second Wildcard Spot at the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups – two pieces with the Montreal Canadians and the Avalanche.
Northern Sea oil workers start conversations again, strike out
Labour struggles regarding the reward for North Sea oil workers will be exposed, while all dispute parties sit at the table for a new round of conversation, negotiators said.
Strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadicly on North Sea platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group, as well as the Unite and RMT trade unions, can confirm that we have agreed to re-start the process of settlement of the current dispute,” he said in a common statement.
We will hold a few full-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will begin early next year to resolve the problems.
The trade unions said their last strike, the first in over 25 years, is a protest against possible wage reductions of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group has reduced the rates of its contractors in the North Sea by about 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company’s rate cut follows a 10 percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts give the company the space needed to come through the market decline.
Shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its business activities as a result of its mega-fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to the lower raw oil prices, an economic situation that had been strengthened by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with worker leaders early this week to discuss one of the largest labour disputes that have been held in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important to the regional economy, he said.
“In the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for few,” he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in expenditure for new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of around $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures rotational rate of stars in the Plejades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the Plejades.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the star crowds rotate at different rates and in what connection the rotational periods are with planetary development.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The star range of the Plejades is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars in this star crowd, which emerged about 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.
They're turning the fastest now.
To the peak rotation rates these maturing stars run out large amounts of star winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot—like sun spots.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars rotating slower pirouettes than smaller.
"In the Plejad ballet we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Since the star range of the Plejades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare star qualities such as rotational rates.
“The Plejades’ star range offers an anchor for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, younger and older,” Rebull said.
There is still a lot in front of us that we want to know more about how, when and why stars slow their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang their "dance shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Plejades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star starts
The tears were running faster at Alex Rodriguez than the U.S. baseball star in the best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation announcement on August 12, the 41-year-old professional will last wear the suit of his New York Yankees against the Tampa Bay Rays.
“I love this game and this team.”
“I’m saying goodbye to both,” said the 14-four-time all-star game participant in the Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times Rodriguez was elected the most valuable player in the league, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has given him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full wage.
As a player, Rodriguez returned for a long time with performance.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams for the Seattle Mariners (1994–2000), the Texas Rangers (2001–2004) and the Yankees since 2005, he created a few milestones.
With Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be admitted to the Baseball Fame Hall.
Because so successfully Rodriguez - Spitzname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so his appearance is controversial outside the square.
Already in 2009, the superstar admitted to ESPN to have taken prohibited steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was blocked by the end of 2014 for 211 matches due to an interruption in the so-called biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is considered to have been the main suspicious for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a dispute, the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters.
“The league might even have made me a favor for 2014 because I have been playing 20 years without break,” Rodriguez said.
His farewell days are not noisy either.
While many baseball legends once again received the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bank.
“My job does not include a farewell tour.”
"My job involves the attempt to win every game," Yankees coach Joe Girardi said.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz, and the relationship with popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy from fans from the Yankee rival Boston Red Sox.
“We want A-Rod,” the followers sang against the Rodriguez team at 4:9.
Olympic 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: Due to a positive doping sample, weightlifters Adrian Zielinski cannot start from Poland in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
An athlete had almost won a medal.
Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping cases became known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria, and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski, were positively tested and excluded in Brazil – immediately before the beginning of the lightweight competitions that were critically embedded, these news come into time.
At Chen last Sunday, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide used as a masking agent for doping substances was demonstrated.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old ranked fourth in the final over 100 metres of butterfly, only 0.09 seconds missing the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen was supposed to participate in the precursions over 50 m free style.
Chen requested the opening of the B sample and an hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The National Association takes the matter "very seriously and demands Chen's full cooperation in the investigations," Xinhua said in a statement: "We will work with the International Sports Court CAS and accept the judgment."
For the first time in history, IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also in the night of Rio, he brought the news about the positive sample at Danekowa, the 33-year-old went into the offensive himself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she told the Bulgarian TV channel BNT.
She is innocent, "the only explanation could be nutritional supplements," the athlete said.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is to be the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa has been suspended provisionally, according to BNT, the B sample has already failed positively.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissov immediately reported criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weight lifters from the chronic doping-loaded nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic winner in class up to 85 kg was positively tested as his brother Tomasz three days earlier on the anabolic steroid Nandrolone.
Both denied the intake, but both are not allowed to start up to 94 kg in the class.
Before the launch of the light athletes, the Danekowa case is especially another heavy impact for the reputation of the entire sport.
The World Association IAAF had prohibited the entire Russian team to launch an exception due to systematic doping, including the running removal of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming sports, previous offences in China had also taken care of heavy disputes between the athletes.
The French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic winner Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang pinkelt lila."
"If I see the podium over 200 m free style, I want to pass myself," Lacourt said on the French radio.
Sun was also at the center of a discussion with Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping scammers," he said.
In 2014, Sun was positively tested at the Chinese championships on the stimulant trimetazidine, but only a three-month lock had to be seated.
Data clause: So perfide hackers express their ransom
Programmers of expression malware currently targetedly attack companies - and are successful.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been at least once in the past 12 months, sometimes several times victims of an attack with erpressor software.
In Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies were already target of ransomware expression.
40% of the victims willingly paid the ransoms required by the perpetrators to be able to reuse the attacked systems and data.
According to Malwarebytes’ observations, the perpetrators specialize their erpressor software on attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially expressing ransom is significantly higher than in private users.
“We are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of malware,” explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in a conversation with the World.
In 2008, most malware programs were designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered expression software for themselves.
Only private users were the goal, but the shift to firm attacks was scaryly quick in the past few months.
Ransomware works on a simple pattern: Once actively on a victim’s computer, it is looking for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archiving images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals sustainablely.
The software subsequently presents the demands of the epressors.
To get the end encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
However, where the personal photo database is at stake with private users, companies are about sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is stopped.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware applies.
22 percent of German companies reported sales losses from ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt their business, in one case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, a number of hospitals were victims of attacks whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always say to the victims: Don't pay, they only promote the problem," said Kleczynski.
However, 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay will get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to refuse the claim of the perpetrators in the face of a halt in operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure’s security researchers have examined the user interfaces and contact with the expressers and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims by chat how to pay by bitcoin, send freely accessible support websites, or decode example files for free.
And if private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to partly negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencryptedly.
Given the potentially high and relatively riskless profits from ransomware expression, hackers become more professional and share the job, security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider Sophos explains: "A single person can write a ransomware about within a week."
It is more likely, however, that they are three or four people.
Programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software build box to the actual epressors.
The previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a single, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"Including delivery is a customization tool, so smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," Wisniewski says.
The expressers then look for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service industry.
So you log in in one of the forums in the underground, buy the set from a criminal, and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is made per infected computer.
“Usually the criminals then hire spammers with the spread,” Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known in many companies that better secure their data.
Over 50 percent of IT companies in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to defend ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already following new strategies.
“If data encryption alone is no longer sufficient threat to successful exhaustion, the perpetrators instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations,” says Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that the damage potential depending on the type of data is more than much higher than before.
Furthermore, the perpetrators could take new targets on the Internet of Things on the grain.
At the Defcon Hacker Conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the free switching of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future blocks an entire production line in a factory, ransomware could also become a topic in industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and the versatility of a minivan.
It sounds quite overloading, but the HR-V, which was designed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be very flexible in everyday life.
Although only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in both the first row and the background, it does not work narrow in any place.
The materials of the interior are well processed and look pleasant, but only the cockpit upper side falls somewhat down there.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage space.
There is not only a bagage room of 453 l at high and 1026 l at folded backs, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seating surfaces of the rear bank can be flapped highly like film chairs and thus offer storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceilings.
The baggage room can be charged well, but the charging height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The 1.6-l diesel tested with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates the HR-V with the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed range.
But he should do his work a little quietly.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is delightful.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-l benzine with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves no wishes open in the tested top "Executive" variant.
The security systems include the City-Not-Break Assistant (worked up to Tempo 32), the Collision Warning System and the Track Stand Assistant.
The collision warner is sometimes irritating because it ranks many obstacles as “nearby objects” when ranking.
The remote light assistant works very reliablely.
And the intelligent speed controller responds to traffic sign detection and drives the speed if necessary.
However, the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and an HDMI box are under the armrests and are therefore somewhat to be reached.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
Anyone who does not want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines comply with the Euro 6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: drop on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because liability is only possible in the event of dangers typical of air transport, the Upper Landes Court of Düsseldorf argued (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The defendant had broken a knee disk at the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it is a general life risk, the court says.
The airline did not have to pay the man damage.
Case of illness: When the organizer pays
Sick travellers only get money back after their trip if the cause of the illness is doubtless found at the hotel.
But this is only the case when more than ten percent of guests proved to show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family on the second day of their Turkish vacation was severely ill of diarrhea and vomiting.
She spent almost all the holidays in the room.
Their disease led the holidayers back to a defective clearing plant that allegedly contaminated the sea water.
The family believed that the trip was lacking - and complained against the organizer.
The prosecutors did not succeed in court.
The clearing system was indeed defective.
However, the organizer only learned about it shortly before the departure of the applicants.
He had to assume until then that the sea water was fine.
He did not violate his information obligations, according to the judgment.
No contaminations were found especially in the water samples.
The disease of several hotel guests – possibly by infection with each other – belongs to the general life risk.
Of 691 guests were only 38.
De Maizière said, after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state must react firmly and at the same time to terror threats.
Our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
This triumph will not be given to the terrorists.
If criminals had to leave the country faster, it increases security and strengthens the population’s approval for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to implement the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced another personal reinforcement of security forces, "in a medium four-digit size order over several years."
Sympathy advertising for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance is intended to improve the arms law so that it is difficult to buy weapons on the Internet.
The last much discussed silence obligation for physicians is to be kept in accordance with de Maizières.
However, in dialogue with the doctors he wants to look for solutions to reduce the threat of citizens, he said, for example, with a view to psychological disabilities.
In order to counter a radicalization of refugees, the Minister believes that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
In order to pursue criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet) de Maizière plans the use of hidden investigators.
SPD Chief Gabriel said: “The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security.”
It is important that the Minister of Interior has clearly spoken against actionism.
“This was an earscape for the sharpmakers in the CDU/CSU,” Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a Burka ban and the abolition of double nationality.
A general prohibition of full shutdown considers it constitutionally problematic.
You can't forbid everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
You can talk about rules, such as in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green Chief Simone Peter said he wants to simulate action force and action with ever-new anti-terror packages.
Left Partyman Bernd Riexinger said, “Float Proverbs and a sharpness of residence rights no longer bring people in this country to safety.”
Better traffic flow on the highway carrier
It stands regularly on the circumference road - here is a picture of November.
However, this is to change: the right track is to be extended.
This is a good news for all car drivers who are in the traffic on the surrounding road every evening when they drive over the motorway (A 43).
On Tuesday and Wednesday (16th/17th August) in the area between the Hammer Straße and the Weseler Straße departure, the right bearing track will be extended by 700 meters.
Then drivers can inver directly from the Hammer Road to the right.
The great advantage: traffic is shared earlier, improving the overall running on the long-traveled section of the Federal Road 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU group in the district representation of Münster-West.
The road narrowing on the carrier nerves the drivers primarily between 17:00 and 19:00.
On workdays, the backbone extends to the bridge over the Albersloher path and sometimes beyond.
The needle hole is on the B 51 just before departure Weseler Straße.
From here, the traffic will only be stepped away by the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt three-quarter years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary carrying force to take the heavy load traffic on a two-way basis.
How long this growth and the associated daily storage will last, the relevant national company cannot tell it.
However, it is expected to be years: because the bridge has an official duration of remaining use by 2034.
For the extension of the legal track, the country has deliberately chosen the weakest traffic time in school holidays because there are disabilities to be expected.
Traffic will be passed on Tuesday and on Wednesday on a track of the construction site.
Intercultural travel: cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the play "The Invisible House".
The Nima's Association and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The Nima’s Association allows young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Klasse International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the award-winning piece "Das invisible house" of the Young Theater Münster.
In the context of the Nima’s “Intercultural Journey” initiated, 19 students aged 11 to 15 attended the Small House’s stage.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background, offers the opportunity to attend cultural institutions in Münster in the framework of this project.
Most young people of the class came to Munster between September 2015 and March 2016, including from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, speaking little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, scenic images and video animations, it was possible for them to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the Young Theater Münster.
The Nima's Association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Young Theater will work together in the coming game time as part of a music theater project.
From October to December, young people with and without escape and migrant backgrounds between 14 and 20 years will be able to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of song, dance, spectacle and music.
Offers for children and families in theatre game and theatre language mediation are in the planning area.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
Given the rising numbers of refugees, the association expects many classes that want to participate.
Rain instead of star nubes: hope for weather improvement
The weather has taken the Sternschnoppen-Gucker in the southwest of Germany in the night of Friday - yet there is still hope.
The night was unsuitable because of clouds and rain to observe the sky spectaculars, Chairman of Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, said Friday morning.
Our hope is on Saturday night.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we will certainly see a lot of star nuts in the sky.
The stars are Perseides, which are one of the fastest stars with 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they appear to come from the Perseus star image that rises in the northeast.
Relaxing Night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, in the night you wake up for hours, in the morning you’re no longer thinking of sleep before the wake-up.
This is nothing but relaxing.
After all, such problems are in good society: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently unrelaxed.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can underly various causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weess, Board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What you can understand below is insomnia, i.e. a sleep disorder.
Just sleeping makes many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the Board of Directors of the German Housekeeping Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Behind it, organic, psychological or behavior-related factors can be contained, but also medications.
Not rarely, sleep disorder is the expression of another disease.
“Very early awakening is common especially in depression,” says Weess.
And it may be that different factors condition each other.
For example, anyone who has a band disk incident can be poor, wakes up every two to three hours, and maybe begins to grip about everyday problems and sores, Weess gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you get to the doctor with sleep disorders?
Anyone who is not sleeping well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is impaired on a day should go to the doctor, Weess advises.
The impairment can look very different: one is tired, tired, insleepless, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood changes or physical disorders such as stomach or headache.
To relieve sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or also medications - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and maximum for two weeks - are questioned.
Lower sleep medical professionals are hardly available in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medical Center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, in case of sleep problems, you should first contact the doctor, Weess advises.
It can explain with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep laboratory, and what happens?
For examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise, for example, when snoring with breathers, sick day fatigue, sleep transformers, or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains.
You don’t have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Please don't sleep at lunch," says Fietze.
After cable, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, wear a nose glasses, a chest belt and a feeler on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can those affected manage the problems?
There are pretty many adjustment screws where you can apply for a better sleep.
Wees counts on: regular sleeping and resurrection times, not too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not television to sleep, avoid alcohol and not look at the clock at night - then you begin to expect immediately, and that’s not entirely beneficial.
What the jungle camp has with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed herself on Facebook for disappointing cutting off the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he first picked up gold at the World Short Railway Championships in Doha and at the same time set up his first world record.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has been protecting himself from his former teammates in the criticism.
“In a country where an Olympic winner gets €20,000 prize and a jungle king €150,000 should no one wonder about missing medals,” the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page Friday night.
The conveying system in swimming sports is poor, but the doping controls are very good.
This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at doping or even run it.
"I don't say that the controls should be set up here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have been reported nine months before his first launch of the German National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA).
That’s exactly how it should be kept with countries as well.
“Whoever cannot be controlled by independent controllers of WADA/FINA for a certain time before the World Cup/OS, cannot participate,” the election hamburger, currently operating an ice dial, asks.
Airport: Bands of luggage thieves are arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
Dusseldorf police civilians managed to arrest two women and two men aged 50 to 61 on Thursday.
The suspects had committed several bags and luggage thefts as bands.
At around 21:30 civilian officials in the Düsseldorf Airport recognized a band known to the police from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July this year and had been committed together, jobs and particularly professionally.
Specialists at the Office of Criminal Commissioner 34 can demonstrate four actions to the thieves who were particularly coming to Germany to commit offences.
In total, they had earned more than 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, a remaining headstein plaster: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn’t work so at first glance, but the police counts it among the “dangerous places” of the city.
If you go along the road from east to west, you will come to playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a bioshop.
Someone sprayed to the facade of a grey house "hasty!"
As opposed to a Lidl, which is soon to be destroyed, is already built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created here.
Articles about this "trending district", as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are however preferably illustrated in recent weeks with burning cars.
Reason is the house with number 94: Once it was occupied, now the inhabitants have rental contracts, but on the ground floor are still occupied and are used for events.
Especially since the beginning of the year, Berlin's internal senator Henkel had pronounced himself several times for a hard action by the police against the project, referring to the area as "No-Go Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
On 22 June, after the ground floor rooms, the Cadtersmith, with 300 police officers had been spared, the police patrolled official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court decided that the house was illegal, and one day later police and construction workers dropped off under the joy of sympathetics and residents.
On this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the trail in front of the houses in the sun, others have a late conversation.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a basic school and children's gardens.
Left violence is not the main care of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are generally generated by the police presence.
With the residents of the home projects they share concerns about increasing rentals and genetrification.
It sounds not like a kiez who mostly wanted police protection from vandaling left.
The graven, which the Berlin internal senator and the police open between householders and their neighbors, apparently does not exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional worker’s district, which also today has a low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city.
Also home occupations and the residential projects born from it have long been the Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street very close to the Riga.
While the Mainzers had been spawned under a large police order in a regular street battle, many of the projects have been legalized in the Riga and are inhabited in part today by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world: with them, residents from DDR times and former householders are now sharing their Kiez.
This is also noticeable for rentals that have increased by almost 60 percent in new rental companies since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols of this development: they are recognized on thrown in discs or freshly removed façades designed with color bags.
No other roads have been mentioned this year so often together with the words "left-autonomous violence".
One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively against policemen.
Most of the offences cause damage to matter, which tend to rather hit new buildings and freshly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, cannot be talked about uncertainty.
As for violence, it is quiet: people in the 94 are their neighbors who certainly weren’t.
Even the famous burning cars have no longer been available directly in the Riga.
For the study architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere."
Neuebauer consciously moved into the Riga street - and remained.
That’s why it was also so important to her that the inhabitants get back their streets: from the police, the politics and the media, who all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July.
However, in the eyes of inhabitants like Neugebauer, the street is still taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former building decays that depress the old inhabitants.
"These are ultimately homes that are not interesting to many here - here are rather people who aren't so beaten," she says.
“I cannot accept violence and destruction.”
But what should you do if anyone never listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.
For those who are angry about color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the home projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.
Those who move through should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub neighborhood can complain badly there about noise.
All persons presented only with names have asked not to be named with their right name.
Urbach: Annika Gottchle is a New Refugee Representative
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organization.
She is also a social worker on site.
Since July, Annika Gottchle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social educator supports the management team for Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact person for all stakeholders: refugees, workplace refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else mixes with them.
Regine customer from the work circle suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eggs of wool milk that has a problem above all.
So some - less spotting than rather targeting the numerous areas of tasks requested - meant that the administration wanted to declare the office.
An administrative expert was sought for a talent for languages and people, associated with a long experience in social work, just an ovulating wool milk sau.
But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Gottchle.
Above all, it’s about organization, work with people on site and also behind the scenes, as well as network activity.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She has a 50 percent place for three years.
“It was high time,” says Regine Kunden, Annika Gottchle supports honourable and main official actors.
There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
New containers will soon be in the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
You must house refugees in your own or rented living rooms.
The cost of the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must be paid by the municipalities themselves.
Responsibility changes from the Land Council office to municipality and job center.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.
It doesn’t work yet, you’re relying on private apartments, says Deuschle.
Therefore, communal apartments need to be removed as it is called beautiful.
So soon new containers will be installed in the Wasenstraße.
But it is not done only with apartments.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a fixed residence, there are internships, training facilities, school facilities, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who have to be found or established.
"More places would be good," said Regine Customer.
Many work in the building court or help homemasters, do non-profit work - and this motivated and very ordinarily, Annika Gottchle reports.
She hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.
This is “no employment therapy.”
Activity does not mean only work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People should develop a sense of affiliation.
So you need offers such as sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
Therefore, administration and volunteers are also going on here.
It is essential that the refugees feel like they are desired and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it just takes it and they can make sense to overbridge time, for example with language courses.
Anyone who eventually feels that he cannot help anyone in Urbach, cannot work and be useless, he will never integrate.
The significant majority is motivated.
There are problems, however, also, customer honestly says, "people who are not going to do anything." Therefore, the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others.
It’s all a “mammuta” task.
A difficult question: Are the two afraid of radicalization after the recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Kunden clearly, "what someone calls naive." A residual risk can and doesn't want to exclude it.
The helpers are aware of it.
These incidents are also the subject of refugees.
They would be afraid that the assassins will bring them completely in default.
“They want to show that they have nothing to do with it,” says Regine Kunden.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Therefore, main and volunteer personnel must look for activities on site and in the region.
They always have in the background that soon a new shot of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics are scared.
Actually, it is unfair to put them on site to helpers.
“In Urbach we haven’t yet arrived where we want to go,” says Annika Gottchle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine customer also makes it clear that the urbans have already been charged with reasonable integration of the previous people.
They are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, you need to help them, both women agree.
The political situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
