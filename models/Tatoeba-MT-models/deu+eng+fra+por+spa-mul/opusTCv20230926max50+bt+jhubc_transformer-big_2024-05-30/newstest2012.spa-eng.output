Parliament did not support amendment to release Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the Criminal Code section in which the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko is condemned.
The amendment would open the doors to the express minister's detention, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic offences in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signature of a disadvantageous agreement with Russia for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet firm, the appeal court has the obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West have arisen doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code with which the former Prime Minister was condemned was supported by 147 members of the vote.
For approval, 226 votes were required.
The victory of Libya
The story of Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war anymore.
Left to define who is the winner
As is already customary in the region, Islamists have won the elections, but now it’s about to dilute whether it’s moderate or radical.
The National Transition Council has entered into force the traditional law, sharia, which we already know in some way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the thieves will be cut their hands.
Women can already be forgotten to emancipate and the apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of by the person of the dictator, society, composed of warrior tribes, will be joined by the Koran.
In Libya there will be an order that we cannot imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best, and probably it was not suitable for the Libyans mentioned.
The truth is that it is no longer surprising that Islamic fighters would accept thankfully the help of infidel dogs.
The only justification was that, from its point of view, NATO attacks did not lead them an American general, but great is Allah, whose greatness celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When they are looking for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting from which Islamists and our politicians are served to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militaryly.
In this case, locals do not pose a problem to expel the "cruises"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies be able to get with Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible that no, but it may be that finally the West can presume of protecting human rights.
As long as the followers of the sharia do not cross us.
Begins a new era of the crisis
France and the rest of Europe are going to hunt investor search engine
A statistical twist has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the interquatrimesteral period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer fixed only in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The Eurozone statistical offices, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP increased 0.5%, France's 0.4%
Both countries have made public the second quarter data, in Germany has improved more than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of expected 0.1%), although a slight 0.1% reduction was given in France (the original data were talking about stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% annually in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the interquatrimestral period, the gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to ČSÚ, the tendency to gradual slowdown in growth in economic development is shaped.
The results are even worse than the forecasts of analysts.
Main Events:
Inter-annually, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but quarterly stagnated.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew 0.2%, according to the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen 5.2% annually.

The interest of Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problem situation begins to affect also Austria, Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
Czech 10-year-old bond interest remains 4%, although in the area the situation is worsening.
In Germany, voices are raised that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs are classified for the Eurocup.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the ranking with a premium 200 million.
The football team fulfils the most difficult task of the entire season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant gateway Petr Jiraček, the victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second time, was fantastically defended from the attacks of the local team, so it will not lack the European championship appointment.
IHNED.cz followed the development of the party in a thorough report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second half.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team to the end, and also the excellent game of Čech and the heroic Jiraček, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its pass to the European Championship.
Because of the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured party were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who passed two big occasions.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr Čech, the eleven Czech will not miss the European Cup appointment, so the arks of national football will receive approximately 200 million crowns.
Since the first few minutes, a good offensive game was given.
Both teams committed themselves to maintaining the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from local players in the first half, hit the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense could avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundreds of college students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture, they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students began to pray Tuesday at noon in front of the facilities and then core death slogans to the United States and Israel.
Several hundreds of college students formed human shields in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Tuesday around the nuclear technology center where it works with uranium.
They intend to demonstrate that they are willing to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
In a recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found that Iran, according to all the evidence, strives to obtain nuclear weapons.
In Israel, there is a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon before the nuclear facilities in Isfahan and then launched slogans of death against the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear program, Israeli sources said, would be achieved not only the Isfahan plant but also the Natanz facilities where uranium is enriched.
Obesity Child's Daily Menu: No Breakfast and Dinner Embedded
More than one-third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9% of school population and 5% obesity.
Obesity children proceed mostly from families with a lifestyle that is unhealthy, according to current research.
It is again demonstrated the importance of the environment where it grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obsessive children are fed, for example, from built-ins at least twice as often as children from families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had dinner fried potatoes on the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a chance."
In families of overweight children there is no custom to practice sports, which applies to most current families, where only 15% of children replied that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey conducted to 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and participated in the same nearly 900 children from Basic Education throughout the Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the program "The Obesity of Not is a Chance", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th course.
A suitable diet and fairly family exercise are decisive factors, which significantly decrease the number of children with overweight and even obesity.
“Only half of the children surveyed have responded to have five meals daily according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, meal, lunch and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet,” the survey said.
No breakfast but built-in for dinner
Specialists warn that in healthy development, details are also important, such as having a fixed hour for family breakfast.
In Czech Republic, however, only 23% of school families breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to discover that in 10% of households there is no breakfast.
Breakfast is, however, the basis for a proper daily diet.
The study shows that in families of obese children crazy potatoes are consumed much more often.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks daily sweet refreshments (70%).
Usually, more than 40% of children surveyed do sport, however, among their parents, this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Fabricate your diet
The next phase of the study enabled the elected boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
“The food preferences of Czech children in ages between 12 and 15, from the point of view of healthy food, are very far from the ideal.”
Among your favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets.
"It's especially alarming the popularity of sweet refreshment," the study's final report states.
As a main food, the palm is taken the pasta and the bird meat follows it closely.
Practically, children always reject vegetables and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive fair information.
"In the control group of participants in the study, who filled the questionnaire after completing the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence," in many cases a significant change was given in favour of the principles of healthy eating."
Draw attention, for example, to sweet cooks, where many children would begin to prefer normal and current water.
Children would also more often choose bird meat and fish for main food and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals say
In the introductory article, How stylists learn, I already complained a bit that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conferences from three branch professionals, how to dress problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the show world.
And it will be worse.
The closer the final exams, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is no longer suitable for a filler.
We have once studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) about how to dress a woman who doesn’t have a perfect symmetry.
And that's the vast majority.
Someone is short, someone has a stylish figure without the right curves and someone suffers overweight.
The stylist must know to optically smooth wide shoulders, elong a neck, or recreate the necessary curves.
We have been given some tricks about how to highlight the body of women of the kind of Jennifer Lopez, of huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not dress it in a too challenging way.
If, for example, the difference between waist and hips is so much that the skirt or pants are not adapted, it is worth sewing at least one piece of extra fabric tailored.
They will certainly not regret, because the clothes you feel perfectly are unpaid.
With a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than with one not to stop moving, stand up, dancing in the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidered or draped.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I am happy that I have all week to order all this information in my head.
And even so, I fear that with the assigned task, I already have more than left.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two famous, to whom he must design two clothes: one for the day and another for the night.
It should be taken into account the current aspect, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
I have touched "dressing" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Crying inside, for me, it’s much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently fattened a few hundred pounds (please take into account the exaggeration), or young Selena Gómez.
We have to cut the dress from the magazines or look for them on the internet and print them, and then make them graphically.
The moodboard, which is called the full result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The stylist, therefore, has not only physically dressed, but also deals with, for example, product pages in magazines (of specific topics such as trends, pockets, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us about this.
But all this remains for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three specialist guests encouraged the Saturday conference with information about all types of bodies.
Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same clothing in different ways.
Variability is fundamental in this case.
Thus, such a gabardine (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed classic with cowboys and shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body with tackle shoes and photograph it as if it actually was a dress.
Either it is enough to remove it and climb the neck to get a completely different image.
"Play with it," he insisted.
What I most appreciate is the following advice: “To start working, you must first know all the rules.”
"Then you can break them," Jakub said.
Finally, it becomes clear why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with why, why, if then it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
That's not talking about parades.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reservation than he wants to photograph.
Thus, for a fashion story that has ten pages (so, ten outfits), you have to be prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And in addition to the photos the clothing works in combination with other clothes, all different from those weared in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style are alone, in many cases, half of success.
Just look at Madonna, which is not precisely an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marketer have made her a world star.
In Czech Republic, at the moment, there is not yet a clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Even famous characters also find it useless (I am sufficient for my skills, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, we must bear in mind that it is very likely that they will indicate us a very different size than your real (small) size.
Then it is only going to look at and find out whether the heart magazines have already written on the topic, whether a certain celebrity has fattened/add-oned, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to be oriented in fashion, but he has to understand outfit.
During your work, you must mostly communicate with the people you’ve seen, so it’s essential to be a good psychologist.
He can appreciate people, doesn’t miss, he defends his opinions.
“When a director hires you to classify her clothes and complete her with beautiful clothes, you can’t grab and throw everything there was and say, ‘Fuck what horror’.”
“Find at least a couple of things you can think about and recommend that someone can put them on,” Mario says.
He himself also showed us that everything must fit in the so-called "placovka", i.e. the workbag.
This is fixed around the waist and there are all the necessary tools.
There is also nailon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo session of products such as pockets or caps), special clothing clamp clips ahead, if it is older (the clips and other type of clips are not allowed or could damage a set of tissue)
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to cover the sole of our shoes.
Even during photo sessions in the studio, on a flat surface, the sole and much more outside could be damaged.
And we didn't just cover and cover.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the scissors so we couldn't damage them accidentally.
So it had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy to praise my work without reservations.
The truth is that I don’t get those skills very well.
This is just a small part of all of those we have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I’ve already realized that devoting to stylism at professional level is not a rose path, but it gives me exactly what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run competes throughout America.
Review
A trip, in principle unanswered, is complicated because of a series of improper carelessness of a routine trip during the tomorrow shift.
To some extent it was able to cover expectations, but this doesn't serve anything, if, in fact, it was not intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new delivery, which is added to the title The Run, awakened great expectations already before its premiere.
He promised that he would give new airs to the old race saga Need for Speed and, after shown, appears as a game that shouldn’t end up being a genre of action without any more.
We are also curious to know how the scenes would be inserted, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As it usually happens in the NFS series, the results don’t differ much from what we expected.
There are races that can be given for acceptable, but in the total computing points are lost because of absurd failures, which have already appeared in the series for years.
In fact, it cannot be called errors, but it is rather the incomprehensible mistake of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced in a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal career throughout America.
You sit on the wheel at the west coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then in more than fifty races.
This results in that each race takes place by a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
Thus, one doesn’t even have the feeling remotely that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasant at sight, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to the previous deliveries of the series.
Therefore, it's nothing from the other world.
But the walk through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are diversifying from time to time by an atypical element.
Thus, for example, in the desert you find a sand storm that decreases visibility.
Instead, you must be careful in the mountains not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that’s enough.
For a moment, you try to advance a number of rivals required (normal in a classic race), then try to earn time (classical duel timed) and then await a duel against a single adversary.
In the middle of all this, sometimes the police appear, which doesn’t just make things even more difficult.
The newness is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button right at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are lots of fewer landscapes in the game than you could expect (in particular, there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the footprints of the previous episodes.
That means that today it is no longer a big thing, but it cannot be claimed to be bad.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you can already look elsewhere.
But for a race designed with quite action, this style of driving is quite suitable for you, although we can find something better among the competition games.
Until here, everything in order.
But the problems arise after a while.
Unlike the right driving models, the same is no longer happening with collisions.
From this type of games it cannot be expected to recreate complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a blow against any object, you cannot predict how your car will react, with which not everything is in order.
It is typical that, by making a very tight advance or circulating the car with a normal traffic, there are only light sprays, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrolled piruetes.
Or even completely destroyed.
Thanks to the resete system, there are no major problems, but it can put you in bad mood.
The reset is scheduled in such a way that when you suffer an accident or leave the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
In each race, however, there are only five races available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it’s just a help in case something doesn’t go well, but it’s not too trustful.
Sometimes, neither reset helps, only helps learn the given stage of memory.
A big disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you must enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, although you are the first, fifth, or arrive five minutes before or later.
This makes it anger especially in situations, when you see two cars going to meet in opposite directions, your opponent goes ahead without trouble, but when you arrive, you should rotate or either break.
It’s the same when you arrive, because it’s scheduled that the “surprise” will always happen in front of your noses.
The adversaries also have a further advantage.
Throughout the entire match you will reach places where, without taking into account the time, the same adversary will always ahead of you on the same site.
This also happens at the end of the match, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When it goes ahead of you, it makes the vision of the cars coming ahead of you, so at first you can wrap your car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that you surely disappoint you immediately.
And it’s a pity, because even though the model of the journey is simple, the game is fun and with action, so it’s often not possible to follow detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn’t matter, whether merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or racing classification so that it doesn’t break boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is changing cars during the races.
You have to be attentive to gasoline suppliers next to the road, because exactly there you have to change your car, although in the vast majority of cases what you have is enough for you.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and exotic supersports for technical driving, for example, by mountain roads with curves.
In addition, main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know for stories.
Here you will not only get medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both for challenges and stories.
By reaching the upper level, the driver opens several possibilities, starting with the car and finishing with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog feature is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community features.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race is done in history.
With the car you arrive to the metro tunnel (pass), where you get running in dark through the paths (pass).
The speed meter marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and suddenly behind you comes the metro convoy and takes you ahead without anything else.
In the writing we will certainly have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game none thought even a little bit, or whether the authors really take us for a panda of idiots.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most pleasant cases, sometimes even proud.
What a shame that, in the most tense moments, the image quality is reduced and sometimes in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when the continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of tastes.
In order to be the pleasure of most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game alone for his music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely stupid mistakes, we would have trouble claiming that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not complete.
Fun is insured, but prepare because the mistakes will hit you in your eyes with the strength of some airport reflectors.

The Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation of negativists and eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect a war without a quarter."
"It will last five, six years, before the situation becomes a little stabilized, calms and new players get used to their new roles," the Czech Ambassador to the EU Milena Vicenová said.
How not to be taken seriously his motto "clear and openly about Europe", which he said in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relationships with such precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many speakers from the U. Carolina Law School.
Vicenová also pondered the work of the new Permanent Chairman of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
“The first thing comes from criticism, that if it is insulent, a gray official, capable of taking any role, but I must say that it left everyone disturbed, because it takes their roles at perfection.”
“He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them and has a very clear view of where the EU should go.”
The new position of representative for Foreign and Security Policy is explained from the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" It is therefore an important step towards unification and clarification of the political union facing States such as China or India.
No one wants to forbid Olomouc's cheese
Vicenová has also held the following agenda, follows and follows the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, solved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good uprising", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, the seven-year budget of the EU must be approved, caused by the current, much more complicated economic situation.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive greater support and which less? That is something that will be present on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe clearly."
“The truth is that I don’t like the ugly abbreviations, the foreign expressions or the jerseys that people don’t understand.”
“How can a citizen understand that in Brussels, curved or round cucumbers are not really invented, bananas of various sizes, or that no one will forbid Olomouc cheese?”
It also aims to take advantage of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to European institutions.
Europe is waiting for speeds
According to the ambassador, Czechs are renowned as eurosceptics and people rather perceive the negative aspects than the positive.
In addition, it regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The blame is a multitude of factors, such as the modestity of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me that when a Polish and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches me, a Frenchman next to me says, 'What are you, those of the Visegrad Group already left?', and it is seen that he doesn't do any fun."
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, is waiting for new harsh budgetary policy regulations for Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if they are no longer, in Europe, more than the new of "the European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and also have the procedure for reinforced cooperation."
“It was said for the first time that only the countries they want to cooperate and those who don’t, that they remain away.”
“These procedures will be increasingly and will strengthen Europe of both speeds,” Vicenová is expected.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of Czech and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the entire EU should be discussed among member states, not only among members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
Innovative IBM starts its second century of existence
If someone looks for a term that highly accurately defines IBM’s strategy, the most approximate would be “long-term”.
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, however, has passed a hundred years since its foundation.
The basis of this long-standing character set her the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already covered the motto that many problems in the world have solutions if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his stamp, around which the life of the giant future will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the foundation of a carefully raised company culture.
“For us, IBM involves a long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained faithful to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around it.
This has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to thrive even more in our second century,” he said during his anniversary, the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about the care of his employees as the entrepreneur of Başa in Czech (IBM employees were the first American operators who enjoyed paid holidays, safety, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that awarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication keeps IBM in the customer relationship.
Already from the beginning, the company knew to discover talents (being one of the world’s first companies to end any kind of discrimination, he could choose without problems).
In the anti-discrimination strategy line is the IBM’s current plan, with which Palmisano will replace a woman next year: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working for thirty years at IBM, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategies.
Over the past few years, IBM has participated in so-called virtual meetings, rain of ideas online, from which arise infinity of future strategies and innovations.
It’s not surprising that they overcome ideas, as nearly half a million people work in the firm.
An institution with good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of institution more than technological enterprise,” says Harvard Business School economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users,” said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the business and creating a business directly.
IBM – or the “Great Green” – as familiarly known in the US because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world in the past 100 years.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (develops both equipment and programs, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It has the largest number of patents from all U.S. technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among its inventions are the ATM, payment cards, financial exchange, bar codes, and disquets.
IBM will charge $220 billion this year. This year has become the second technology firm for market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first exceeded Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
“If your business is based on progressing, it cannot be anchored emotionally in the past,” Samuel J. Palmisano said.
That’s why IBM has no trouble building its bases on other platforms (and equally, if they don’t work, leave them).
And this is the difference in competition, Microsoft, which basically is maintained and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
In the matter of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which approximately one fifth are programs and another fifth of equipment.
However, even in 1990, teams represented more than half the supplier share.
As of 2000, IBM has sold low-performance assets for a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, IBM has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have followed since 2008, when the world’s modern financial crisis was manifested for the first time.
IBM acts according to the premises of its first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investments.
It seems that IBM has so far been able to cope with the crisis.
The value of IBM’s shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically to 120%, the company’s net profit has no longer increased.
IBM’s currency is to change everything except its value.
We can therefore expect that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
IBM History: From the cheese cutter to space flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, with its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was already adopted in 1924 - it was originally a brand used in branches in Canada and South America.
The basis that led to IBM’s birth emerges from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He possessed inventions such as the famous "fix watch", which allows to control the input and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired his supervisory board.
Flint filed the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the company’s management.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson’s ideas remain the firm basis on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat cutters and cheese to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson led the company, billing doubled by $9 million and started the company’s large expansion across the continents.
Watson was so crucial for the company that, after almost forty years occupiing the boss’ chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM’s staff and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn and the famous flight to the Moon in 1969).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The "fish" classics, which set up the computer standard of the time, arrived on the market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering full advice and high-value added services.
The strategy IBM has paid over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, “a smarter planet.”
Its aim is to make a more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned or circumstances have been improved, for example in the transport and administration of cities.
For the trade sector, IBM has not long launched the "Smart Commerce" platform that allows retailers to manage the entire trade cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
In 1932, he opened a branch in then Czechoslovakia, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Also here is a world-famous research team working with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her infidel husband:
Iveta, stay on that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina still hoped that Josef would wake up from her pink sleep and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
“Pepe can go home, but no longer like my partner,” Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová greeted Bartošové at her house during the summer, she couldn’t imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the petition, Iveta had not moved thirty days after Śíčany and Pepe did not leave the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband's relationship and even goodbye forever.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If Rychtář one day broke with Bartošová, his wife would not wait for him at home with his open arms.
He is the biological father of my children, and if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him out.”
“But here I would live no longer as my beloved old burry that was wrong, but as a man to whom I bond certain ties,” Rychtářová said and added that he had already dismissed from his husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef so far doesn't care if a woman had closed the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
“My wife established this as a marriage on the paper and I respect it.”
“The company remains in force, I make home arrangements, I take care of the garden, home, I make shopping.”
“Darina and I talked to us normally, the only thing is that we don’t share bed,” Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová finds a new love, he would not oppose himself.
“We don’t sleep together and she doesn’t interest me, neither where she goes nor if she has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I’ve fallen in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility,” Josef concludes.
Women’s worst vices: Do they also mean you?
If you ask men to be able to quote some typical vices of women, in general, each of them will appoint them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize them in the following lines, where certain female vices are quoted that can boil blood to men?
Go to shopping
Do you reproach your orange average that has a dependent on purchases?
Should you buy at least one trap a week?
Do you like to buy often in lows?
Then, in your case, you can say that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should soothe their passion for shopping, at least a little bit.
But to see, which woman could resist the temptation to walk through the clothing shops without any further, seek well-adjusted clothes and then try them all on the test (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can virtually become a hell.
Just remember how many times you have told your partner to wait better for her in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
“I’m not too fat?”
“You need to weight at least five pounds – Should you start exercising?”
"Do you really like it?"
Doesn't these phrases sound to you?
What do you do?
Then she's one of those women obsessed with her appearance.
It’s not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to listen to your partner complaining all the time about their physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more complaint frequency increases, the more troubled women become.
Order and cleaning first
It's like an infinite tiovive.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, rinse the floor, remove the dust, rinse the bathtub and all that for at least twice a week.
Does he reproach his partner that he had stepped the clean ground with a dirty foot, his children that have dirty a freshly cleaned washing machine and a shelf with glass doors that so much cost him to clean?
In case you suffer from this "deviation," try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleaning should certainly not be dealt with primary in the family.
This harmless desire for cleaning could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Make unpleasant comments
"Weared socks leave in dirty clothes."
"You want to wear these socks too tomorrow."
"The wet shell is not left on the ground!"
If you make those cometers to your partner more times a day, you know that so you will get them out of your boxes.
Of course, you don't mean anything wrong, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, on their own, wouldn’t make so many comments.
Calumnies and chisms
Some women also calumnies, mockery, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things of the type who, where, with who, how and why.
Maybe every one of us sometimes escapes a small, harmless chism.
With the hand in the heart, this is the property of almost every woman.
On the other hand, there are sparkling women who do not control themselves, who love sparkling and doing so often, despise everyone and are dangerous to those surrounding them, especially in a female work team.
Jágr and Voraček helped beat Philadelphia
Hockey frontman Jaromír Jágr took part in the NHL meeting on Monday with two assists that brought the victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on Carolina’s court and again puts Czech players at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star play, and took a further step and was declared best player of the game.
Two assistance was awarded in the party and also Jágr’s companion, Jakub Voraček.
After the meeting, Jágr claimed to overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
Before the match, I had told him he would triple.
"I presented him."
"Sometimes they seem to be embossed," Jágr explained, after his performance gave a goal to Giroux, following the Flyers' first strike.
A while later, the team’s second intervention also had a Czech track.
Voraček was made with the disc behind the Hurricane's gateway and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who got a goal.
A second before the first pause, a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second part, the Flyers already dominated.
Specifically by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jagr hit the third goal, after his shot came to the quarter of Wayne Simmonds' port.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player on the court, but he's certainly among the best three," Jágr said at his headquarters.
“I would never have thought that at the end of my career I was going to play with an athlete like him.”
"I'm very satisfied with it."
"I want to play for him."
All these years at the NHL, my colleagues were playing for me, and that now produces results,” Jágr added.
Carolina still turned the match into a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again of Dwyer, of penalty, to get a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they were overcome in number of two against one.
“Pronger had a good performance in our field.”
"He cleared the disc, I took speed and Read went to the farthest part."
"I tried to attain him to the album and I'm happy because I got it," Voraček described the last goal of the match as it lived.
With his victory, Philadelphia has been head of the Eastern Conference.
Czech advocate of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retired from a injury at the top of the body.
The Canadians lost not only one player with a lot of defense experience, but also due to a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec didn’t take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the lost points to the local coach regretted the large number of injured in the last row, and play the match with only five defenses.
"That's bad."
“We played the match only with one veteran player, the rest were novels.”
“In the end, but it’s that against that you can’t do anything, we have to deal with it,” Jacques Martin said.
“As long as rotating the players turned against us, we couldn’t resist it.”
“We had to simplify the game even more, remove the disc from our field.”
“And so we left holes,” one of the defenses, P. K. Subban, explained.
Doorkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed with thirty Winnipeg interventions to the 5:2 victory over Tampa Bay.
The Jets goals were scored by five players who thus put an end to a series of defeats lasting five games.
How Travel Prices Evolved Since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time sold in most cases travel only to the socialist bloc, because travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists were therefore on vacation to the beaches of the DDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union, (Sochi in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, the Yugoslav regime then inclined to the west and the Czech tourist journeys were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e., also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually not even by the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or to the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, the individual journey was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the west at the time, but one should be put in the tail with a sleep bag and spend the night all, or have "good known" in the agency.
Still not everything was won.
The so-called "change promise" which was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", which thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of the Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs would acquire. This custom still persist.
The way of travelling the Czechs has suffered an authentic revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was the no longer going to spend the vacation in the DDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which today we are no longer aware of, the fact that to the current favorite destination, Croatia, until 1989, it was not possible to travel freely, because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
In the early 1990s, the exemption of visas to travel to neighboring Western Europe was imposed, causing a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not seem tired of the trips to the west, everyone wanted to see them at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech groups were sleeping in parks in tents, as our income from then did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs at that time was taking food (conserved, embedded, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, buy free Western currency.
Our level of living increased and with it also average wages, which in 1997 resulted in an increase in travel demand.
With the increased travel demand, the agencies began regularly to prepare the trips using charter flight connections, making travel prices incredibly lower compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of getting discounts for the passenger volume.
In the late 90s of the last century, the Czechs traveled without visa to almost all developed countries except the US, which simplified our journeys even further.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism occurred already in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Czech to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with tourists from Czech to far and warm countries are departing every year. This winter will already fly directly from Czech to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries currently visit nearly 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. removed visas for Czech tourists, with which our country became among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their abroad holidays (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have been spent on travel abroad more than 15,000 Czech crowns per head, including expenses on the stay site.
Convocated Ordinary General Assembly to elect the president, which could end again in a dead point.
For nearly five months, Czech football is without president and it is likely that Ivan Hašek’s successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not be known either after the call for the next Extraordinary General Assembly to take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, an agreement has not yet been reached on the rules of voting to be followed.
Without the same, you cannot even vote to choose from the three candidates.
The Czech football leaders are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned from his position in June not without calling for his colleagues to find a strong person who knew to take care of football in the future.
However, after the Hašek era was completed, a controversy was unleashed between the two association federations incapable of reaching an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
Delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Narodní dům), located in the Prague district of Smichov, because the conversations had been blocked and not only as to the method of choice.
No consensus was reached or who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only legal representatives or delegates with full powers.
From that moment and due to this sole point, a partial agreement was carried out, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which the representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes on the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation was no longer able to throw either the Executive Committee that, at its regular or extraordinary meetings, basically did not resolve anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the neuralgic point remains the same.
The question is: How do we proceed in the third round to avoid the dead point?
“The dispute turns around whether it should be proceeded in accordance with the statutes or find another model,” says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice presidents of the FAČR, who, from the association’s direction, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round, the candidate who has a higher percentage of support in the federation to which he will present his candidate.
The Moravia Region is willing to reach a commitment so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemia part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should have the majority of at least two-thirds.
"This would, however, remove the meaning of the two previous rounds and completely deny the concept of bicameral system," so Svoboda understands the objections of the residential party, in which it would best be not touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
With that, surprisingly, he also agrees Tomaš Paclík, although the electoral regulation established by the statutes of all candidates is supposed to be more appropriate to Pelta.
“I would like to be voted to the maximum in accordance with the statutes.”
“So that no foolishness may be invented about representatives as in the last General Assembly,” says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who first postulates as a candidate and who leads his observations mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, the new president will be decided in Nymburk and he believes candidates in the future would cooperate constructively.
“All passions will calm up with our national team’s today’s match at the European Championship.
“Football will again be a protagonist, and thus cooperate more at the pleasure,” says the representative of the Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both at the professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope you reach an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
“It’s not the conflict between Bohemians and moraves, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience.”
“This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly.”
"Anyhow, I hope common sense will be imposed," Rajchl said.
There is no longer a long time for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not left this morning because of technical problems in Prague, having to seek an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the ranking match will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting could finally be the one to be held at the ministerial level, which will be held on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would like to incorporate the split parts into the country’s most powerful sports organization to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czech-Slovac Sport Federation (ČSTV) that will attempt to provide a new direction to the Czech sport following the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclík will struggle to reach the presidency because he does not find a more appropriate candidate.
If the head of the football players of Pilsen, Tomaš Paclik, before the Extraordinary General Assembly, knew the name of an appropriate candidate who satisfies all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), nor would he appear as candidate for such a relevant position.
"If there were a right person, I would be fighting for him and would not present me as a candidate for the election."
"But until today a such person has not been found," Paclík told the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged winner of the elections, which opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that if he won, he would remain as president alone until 2013, when the ordinary general assembly turns arrive.
In that position you would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
“I’ve already talked to some people I could take into account.”
"It was crazy for me to hear some say that at this time they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
“I would like to change that vision,” he adds.
What supposedly bothers Paclík at this time is Pelta’s relationship with the President of the Regional Football Association of Pilsen Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past known outside the world as a powerful lobist able to influence the vote of delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík, it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
“If you win, the current status would be maintained and nothing in football will change.”
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will benefit even less," Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a phone listening during the investigation of a case of corruption, from which Pelta came unpunished.
“I don’t know what prestige football could bring Pelta’s victory.”
"And with what eyes UEFA and FIFA will look at us," Paclík said, who also takes with some precaution his previous statement that "will sell the Pilsen Club if Pelta becomes president."
In the case of winning Thursday’s elections, Paclík might be raising cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Likewise, he is the other candidate, Rajchl, who was supported by Paclík before the General Assembly of September which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine it, for example, as a chief of representation."
“But not as a manager of an association.”
“I don’t put the noses there where I don’t feel capable,” added Paclík, who in September highlighted a lot of attention to supporting the suspension of the Commission of Arbitraries chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits he would dare manage the association.
It recurs to its managing capabilities of private companies, as since last summer he has also been the Director of the Pilsen, who with his support celebrated the first division triumph in May.
“I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to your safe practice.”
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antipathy towards Sparta President Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he exerted pressure on political leaders to destiny more money to the sport of lottery taxes.
“It is one of the key problems to which the new president should be devoted.”
“If they increased gambling taxes, as the political parties announce, they would support their arguments, but, honestly, they have to tell us where they will stop all this money,” he said.
Furthermore, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FAČR should "not support."
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
“But I see no sense of hypocritically giving my Pilsen Club shares to someone else and then returning there after a year and a half,” Paclík said.
Pelta promised to the FAČR new statutes that would end the dead point of the election.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, FAČR would ensure that it would have new statutes that would definitively serve to solve, in the future, disputes regarding electoral regulations.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic as to the Thursday meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-electoral conflict could move forward to a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Already before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on the representation and collection of funds.
He decided to participate in the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month delay could go well to defend and present his ideas on football management in a broader context.
“People of all levels are taking care of football for a long time and hope to meet the new president on Thursday.”
“They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association,” the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked in Sparta and the Association’s Executive Committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hašek.
“Unfortunately, at the General Assembly of June the statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone thought.”
“If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September,” Pelta warned.
Exactly the readaptment of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a whistle to win the delegates.
"If they elect me president, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm willing to answer in case this fails."
“It’s a matter of principles, without which we cannot exist,” Pelta says.
Furthermore, in theory, he tries not to engage with his opponents.
In the past he had warned that he was seen collaborating with Henry Rajchl, who he respects for his Law training, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
For a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík, who, unlike Pelta, did not leave him puppet with his head.
"It's been in the world of football for over a year, and it's already achieved a few successes."
“His attacks but were shameful and a lot of people were surprised by the election campaign.”
"That's why many of them doubt about their true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements already announced in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the upper.
The latter should be football promotion showcase.
“Likewise, I would try to solve all the scandals that arose from the Bohemians as a result of last year’s corruption scandal.”
“I would immediately later be involved in the negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure there is enough money for the whole football,” the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
Then he also promised that his appointment as president of football would not involve any personal changes to the template.
“I should first know the tasks of each employee,” he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, a understandable nervousness is required.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are vatican in front of the next general assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
“If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
"Football needs credibility, which will recover only if it finally has a leader," still two days before the most decisive day in her representative career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership, the FAČR would start working with desire.
If in the fourth General Assembly the current vice president Jindrich Rajchl was elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association, many people would certainly be resented.
Rajchl promises that, if elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make executive committee members responsible for each area of football individually.
It is also committed to resolving the Bohemians’ case, improving relationships with UEFA and FIFA, gaining more money for football and continuing with the work initiated by former President Ivan Hašek.
"As a president, I would like to fully dedicate myself to football."
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the selection, through professional football or training young high-performance footballers.”
"With this I don't mean I would do everything alone," Rajchl said in an interview for the ČTK.
“I am a team player and I want to share the executive competences so that each member can devote himself to a specific area.”
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of impulse."
“A lot of people will probably not like this because it will mean starting working hard and not just criticizing the work of others,” he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that it has considered the possibility of not presenting itself again as a candidate.
"Everyone knows, I work 20 hours a day."
“But I need to know that this will be meaningful and there will be no people behind me who will stop me and hinder me at every step,” he said.
"Many people have told me that I shouldn't give up, because then the others would give up, too."
“It’s about having faith to not abandon that way, without anything else,” he said.
As they say, he also motivates him to continue the work that has already begun with Hašek.
“During those two years, a large part of the work I don’t want to be lost now has been done.”
“There are processes that had begun and will have their effect within a couple of years and I wouldn’t like someone to stop them,” he said concerned that if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be again as it was before the time of Hašek.
“I believe in order, and it’s something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is unable to maintain.
“Behind him is above all those people who would take care of football so that it would be just a privilege for a few elected.”
"I can be reproached a lot of things, but not the fact that I'm in favour of someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
“I want to make a football for everyone, because only so will everyone feel good and not just those chosen,” Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be Bohemian.
“Even though some people try to affirm the opposite, I have in mind doing the best for Moravia.”
"For example, it is time to think about dividing the second division into one part of the Czech and another village, whose winners would go to the first division."
“The current situation in which we have only three Moravia teams would not be given, which is a problem for young moravian players,” Rajchl said.
Although at the punishment of the presidential elections Tomaš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, Rajchl continues to believe in his chances of being elected.
“I still feel like I have strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as his vice president and knows behind me there are clear successes,” Rajchl said, whose successes include the savings of tens of millions of disadvantaged contracts, television contract negotiations and lottery law negotiations.
On the other hand, he recognizes his part of guilt that the federation is not united.
And while he proclaims that Pelta is "disqualified to recover trust in Czech football," he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who has something to offer to football.
“No one can deny that he did a great job for the Pilsen that year.”
“If you are elected, you will probably follow what Ivan Hašek has already started and would not significantly change the staff template in the committees.”
"I don't want to use that in my favour," he thus evaluates his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump to blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible optics, stunning bathrooms in Budapest: Those who visit Europe can live their blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubble bathrooms.
A book shows where you find the best well-being in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something that couldn’t be missing in his luggage, a bathtub.
Turned with the backs over the water, looked at the artistic dome upstairs, swimming towards the marble angels, waiting for her on the edge of the pool and wondered in front of the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his book at the time of all interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in his recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor pools in Munich, the historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete buildings" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast for the culture of the bathroom.
He doesn’t want to have anything to do with sport, Meder says, only water is different.
It’s just bothers you that bathroom fans have to fit with blue tiles and chlorine, while running fans can breathe the fascinating smell of the beet forests or listen to the joyful trines of birds in the park.
“One day I wondered why the pools have to be always so ugly,” says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
Swimming pool and sauna oils, the well-being factor in the pools is so large because every sense is served, according to Meder.
And if the builder strives, indoor swimming pools can be a true gift for view: "Instead of floor, in the bathrooms you have a water surface."
“On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the entire building.”
Everything is optically folded: the high buckets, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The book with small-format photographs "Badefreuden" provides on 190 pages very interesting data about the architecture and history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but mainly gives the desire to jump to blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the highlighted copies in their research in Hungary.
Alongside the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath of Budapest, the waters with nitrates are located in a singular karstic cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as thermals, whose pools are of alkali waters and are located in a building with a bottle shaped.
Many discovered swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the entire city puts your eyes on the rooftop pool of Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, snow covered, from the outdoor pool of a bathroom in St. Antón, and: In the Turkish bathroom there is a window from which you can watch the practice on the ski slopes.
The design, perhaps more extraordinary, awaits customers in Längenfeld: The Ötztal Water Cathedral looks like an UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open sources rises steam in winter, while the mountains of Ötztal rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
In Meder, the pool collector, the chlorine smell did not invade in all pools.
Many thermal bathrooms smell sulfur, in the Árpád bathrooms in Békescsaba, Hungary, gas pest is so strong that people think they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkaline and whose legamus is attached to the skin when entering the pool, enjoying well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in her search for beautiful bathroom places, when he wanted to visit discovered pools and sunbaths in the Czech bathroom in Luhatschowitz, he met a blocked ground.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the crashed windows of the modernist building red, white and yellow, he saw the grass grow between the tiles.
The decay was in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction behind them; not only can neo-romanic elements of the times of their construction in 1844 are discovered, but also an Alhambra-style Arab hall, added in 1900.
Since its emerade modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bathroom of pool collector Iris Meder, not only because it is natural from the Black Forest.
"It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," Meder said.
In a palace like this, the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not have much importance.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank analyzes the business of raw materials
by Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank renounce your business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the matter is clear, according to a study, 84% of Germans seem not acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents claim that the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because they intensify the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a survey by the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global raw material bags causes prices to rise, and banks are responsible for the global hunger problem.
The consumer advocate campaign is directed specifically to Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, bets on raw materials were thought to protect traders from price oscillations.
The leading experts agree that players have uncoupled the offers and demands, and get profits from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticisms differently than U.S. competitors: he promised to review the claims and said that no business “deserves to compromise the good fame of the Deutsche Bank.”
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE information, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed at the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank directive, along with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank’s address will inform the consequences.
In the end, a reduction in the business of raw materials could occur, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, Foodwatch’s founder, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed his criticism to the financial sector: “Betting at growing food prices shows particularly dramaticly how pityless banks currently harm public well-being.”
Ackermann is found as the largest banking cable car, especially in obligations.
“The Deutsche Bank must cancel all the investments from its portfolio in which it puts the money in play for food price bets,” Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with the subject of people hungry or the fame of the Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s inspection is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the consortium chief wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leaving his position.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the Board will change something different from the unplanned in the Board of Directors.
With the abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation you can perfect your image.
And he needs that he barely imports possible losses, that's what his successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would annul investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Just 10 percent considered the Deutsche Bank legitimate to offer investments to beat food prices.
Many of the bank’s customers showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all the investments from which money comes from agricultural speculation.
43 percent would disadvantage a bank like that to its acquaintances, 49 percent would request, after reflecting, cancel his account and switch to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The moved pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A story of architecture with high lows and a happy end, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian Universal Exhibition in Brussels won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, remained empty and fell down.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
Modern postgerra architecture passionates, clear shapes, glass halls, brave curves and new construction materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is an appropriate and known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating construction of steel and glass.
The construction is so far considered a contemporary milestone of architecture.
He made the so well-known architect that he also built the pavilion of Austria at the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flat building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions, was raised after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garten next to the Southern Vienna station, was reformed in 1962 and a 20th century museum was inaugurated inside, called the "20th House".
The building was suitable but lacked the spaces and technology suitable for a museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good environment.
However, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and falls increasingly.
Currently, architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now called it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the Belvedere museum was inaugurated, to which the house belongs, with the first exhibition, a lucky hit in some way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Belvedere Austrian gallery since 2007, has achieved a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, artistic ice sponsor in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and the founding director of the modern art museum in Salzburg, made the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors.
Except for contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafe and a library and also a building of offices are built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because he sensitively reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, expanded him and awarded him the contest, but not because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in his change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are great problems, the building was "an energy devourer," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the glass facade windows was changed, a glass fiber-reinforced insulating glass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos ceilings were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for new use, a light panel descending between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original outdoor doors remain, the house is painted in ancient caoba tones and protected from oxidation.
And the movie room is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
“I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked the monument protection office,” says Krischanitz and warns of a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and lightweight.
The pavilion "which came from Brussels" has been difficult, said Krischanitz recently, a typical "casual disappearance in the history of the city."
Such an architecture is “always in the wrong place” and that’s why I wanted to “wake up the right consciousness.”
In this case house 21 is not in the wrong place, there has occurred an urban lucky blow. The entirely new and planned "central station barrier", with housing and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another lucky hit happens: House 21 could receive a reinforcement of another building from Krischanitz, as collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporary Art Room and, as heard, negotiates with the city on a neighbouring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a package of winter crisis that amounts to millions
The company has designed a crisis plan that would avoid train failures in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
What costs millions.
In the fight against the falls and delays of the trains caused by the winter, Deutsche Bahn has been spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a journalist report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking a group's internal crisis plan, of the planned investments until 2005 of a total of around 300 million euros.
For that, better availability of vehicles and the rail network should be achieved with extreme time.
Among other things, internal and external employees are planned to double to 16,000 positions to remove the snow from the roads and the andenes.
The aim is to clean the snow and ice rods for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, chairman of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train failures and delays during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in travelling as, among other things, he lacked reservations at adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for an authorization from the federal railway office for years.
There is also a delay in delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axis of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the break of an axis at Cologne central station.
Deutsche Bank paid millionary fines in the U.S.
After the turmoil over President Josef Ackerman, a new U.S. problem appears, the Deutsche Bank must pay a millionary fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the U.S. acquires the industry giant, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million euros) in an agreement, to end the disputes due to the failure of five large credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial market regulator NCUA reclaims many big banks to induce credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and dragged banks into the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties to go to the courts," a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York said.
The bank does not admit any guilt with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which required a $20.5 million payment.
Debbie Matz, Chairman of NCUA, celebrated the difference from both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit cooperatives and provides support in case of bankruptcy to protect customer investments.
The NCUA tries to reintegrate the losses of millions originating.
The agreements currently closed are their first type.
The regulator had also requested accounts from other large banks and in summer trials against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the matter of doubtful mortgage securities, they are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, it led to the destruction of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the highest point of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, currently a complicated wind blows for U.S. banks.
Investors and inspection have initiated countless processes to receive compensation or sanction faults.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the most demands.
It accuses the 18 largest international banks that the two U.S. state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business at a volume of approximately $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has a demand from the FHFA, which is business worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses", without naming an accurate figure.
The Deutsche Bank rejected debts as unfounded and explained that he wants to defend himself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
The Finance Guru, Buffett, is investing strongly in the IBM Information Technology Company.
Since March it has acquired stocks for more than $10 billion.
Until now, the large American investor Warren Buffett has always declared no investment in computer companies or information technology since the long-term development forecasts of companies are negative.
But you have read IBM’s trade report and changed your opinion about investing in the sector.
He must have understood much earlier that IBM offers above all services and searches for computer systems for the Information Technology departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive Information Technology should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has currently revealed at the CNBC economy station that has acquired IBM stocks for $10.7 billion since March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway investment has thus risen to one of IBM’s biggest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM hasn’t known anything about the commitment so far.
He praised the leadership that dealt with the ordinary benefits in the economic crisis.
“They have done a great job,” Buffett said on the strategy.
IBM has for some time established profitable Information Technology services such as the operation of calculation centers.
The old computer pioneer over 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful business equipment.
Buffett has avoided technology companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose business he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the occasion in a goods train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway owns approximately 80 own subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of large consortiums such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 60s and, with wise investments, expanded it to make it one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That is why it is an idol for countless investors from all over the world.
His fast and infallible sense of making money has given him the supername of "Omaha's oracle".
After discovering Buffett’s investment, IBM’s stock stocks rose one percent.
“The blue giant,” as IBM is known, has an exchange value of more than $220 billion and figures, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn’t want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is an intimate friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of "Zwickau cell," Turkish media doubt the rule of German law.
A newspaper talks about a "bloody ideology" that is reviving again.
The murders of eight small tricks and Greek entrepreneurs between 2001 and 2006 have a background of the extreme right.
In Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin has been reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin returns a ghost that was thought to be dead long ago, since fire-shaped attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, no more violence with extreme-right background against Turks had occurred.
However, there has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The discovered ultra-rightist network reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, not much less, predictable.
"Does the bloody ideology revive again?", titled the online edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The "Sabah" newspaper emphasizes that one of the crime authors was an informant of the Federal Defense Office of the Constitution and is worried that German authorities may be involved in the ultra-right pantanal.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted wisely, the weekend reminded victims of racist violence with a wake-up in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin along with German and Turkish politicians reflected in a solemn event of the fifty-German-Turkish deal.
Coexistence was set on scene with happy colors, like a story with happy end.
The information came to some Turkish media like a shock: "The German gift for the fifty anniversary," says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German issue "Hürriyet" also does not insist on drawing this mental connection.
“It begins to smell badly,” says the title of Ahmet Külahci’s column.
It emphasizes that the killed were people who paid their taxes and made a significant contribution to their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the internet forums of Germans from Turkish origin, the behavior of police and their subsequent success in searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are astonished that the German authorities have not sought long before suspicious in the ultra-right circle.
The less rhetoric is shown in terms of the drastic media: "From now on, migrants are lost, but self-defense and weapons are left."
“This will be the best self-protection.”
“Germany’s internal peace depends strongly on the quality of clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network,” Selen writes.
This means that, if Germany’s internal peace is in danger, the Mölln and Solingen attacks will be cleared in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks sharpen the group feeling of the Turkish part.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press then mostly criticized the deficiency of German policy after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln's survivors.
After Solingen’s fire-shaped attack sent a telegram of sorry to the Turkish president and his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel replaced him at the funeral of Cologne. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the Turks contribute to Germany’s taxes.
It is clear how a person’s value is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current information of the Turkish media again shows how deep it has since been the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a revaluation of extreme-right terrorism in Germany, this time frank words are needed.
The Bank of the Lake of Zurich Scandal
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.
The UBS almost bankrupted in the financial crisis and since then slipped from a crisis to the next.
Now he runs a German.
Axel Weber didn’t think about it.
After its spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, in July it was known that in 2013 it would begin in a new and almost equally spectacular work: President of the board of the large Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber is publicly happy, praises Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and leaves kind observations about its future colleagues.
“The USB has achieved a revitalization.”
“I am glad to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.”
In September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all the bank’s security systems and deceived €1.7 billion.
Oswald Grübel, CEO of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to go.
The Chairman of the USB Administrative Board considered himself equally touched since then, and everyone asked: When comes Axel Weber?
Weber has been known to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the presidency of the administrative board in May, not in early 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a teacher of economy and counselor and has had a period of adaptation surely necessary.
Suddenly he becomes responsible for a bank’s strategy, which has just reproved that he deserves the title “the largest bank in Europe’s scandal” for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the world’s largest asset administrator, and on the other hand, for years, it slides from a scandal to the next.
Nothing, so it seems, is saved to the old so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent fame until 2007.
The image of the Swiss goods manager, discreet and solid, but also, was combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, the USB manages more money from customers in the world than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the league of the largest banks in the world.
This impressed.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and subsequent bank professor in Zurich for many years, explains: “Before my students, I’ve always qualifying the USB as a model of a good bank.”
"From the current point of view, one asks himself, 'How could I get wrong?'"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something came very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was considered a great and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank’s investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To load this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs.
For this, he found investors, of course, that some looked with despise until shortly before: an Asian and opaque state fund of Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that its name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it worsened.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, President of the Administrative Board, in 2006 in Switzerland’s second best-paid Administrative Board, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its wrong investments, the UBS was found in the financial crisis of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic securities from the UBS for many billion, the Helvetic Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatoryly convertible bond, through which it became the co-owner of the bank.
All Switzerland was affected, it was claimed how dramatic this was for a small country, if it houses such large banks.
Finally, the UBS balance sum in 2007 was more than five times greater than Switzerland’s economic outcomes (see graph).
“We can’t rescue UBS again,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first catastrophe joined the second.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated in a tax conflict with America and proved ready to deliver data from customers who possibly had disappointed taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a $780 billion refund of unjustified profits from these businesses with a payment compensation.
With this, UBS confessed more or less to have helped in tax fraud.
Simultaneously, he lost something that had always been his capital in competition for rich customers: the aureola of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank’s secret is no longer the same.
This followed the resignation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Administrative Board.
And the exodus of customer funds.
In this way, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the investment bank through misleading speculation and in the administration of goods through tax fraud aid.
And just when it was still again, just when it was thought that the UBS was going to get it again, it happens this disgusting story of the operator, an individual operator disappointed €1.7 billion, before the bank realized that something was going wrong.
And it was revealed, obviously, this still doesn’t work well with risk management in the investment bank.
“With the Adoboli case it is manifested that risk controls have changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: “The problem of the UBS is that it does not dominate risk controls.”
The idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers have been presented for a long time, arose to be the guardians of the world’s greatest assets: no too big risk, instead, money security wants to break the other side of the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of Swiss banks were the symbol of unbreakable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The central UBS in Zurich does not fit with the solid Swiss private bank’s cliché, it’s just a little larger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its main headquarters in Zurich Bahnhofstraße street, which goes from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the Swiss mountain snow-covered summits.
Here the buildings are ostentative, the rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
Here are jewelry like Tiffany’s among traditional Swiss businesses like the Sprüngli confectionery.
Here Swiss banks have been living for years: from the national bank, through Credit Suisse Palace, to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
It enters the UBS reception room through a heavy rotary door.
Inside the walls are coated with marble, in front of large leather chairs, next to the logo of the bank there is a large letter to indicate the "security".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two large Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point displaced the big Swiss bank’s idea, or have betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank thinks.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, and ultimately does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the businesses of both big banks.
The UBS has become too large, it thinks, mainly in the investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have earned ground.
The Swiss people had nothing else to say.
"And they have been used to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons for a long time."
In fact, UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial entity had lost both money in the high-risk jungle as the large Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
“That Wednesday, the seven-million small country government coalition decided the largest rescue operation in its nation’s history,” writes author Lukas Hüß in his book “Der UBS-Crash” (“The UBS Crash”).
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do you think of them?
We talk to Swiss bankers, so we see the problem in the UBS dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerged that, due to the merger, was too large for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served for the two different UBS precursor banks to complement themselves: a rich but sleeping bank with the property administration center in Zurich and a poor but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, internationalized investment banks arrived timely with a lot of money, with which they could drive a big financial bike.
There are two names related to this UBS rise: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the Administrative Board.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
“Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive that managed to open a step from learning at the bank to the summit.”
Finally, Ospel relied on Wuffli.
And in the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
Clearly, the destiny came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the management meetings, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Get down from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the League Tables, the rankings that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
A few steps went well.
In foreign exchange trading and share trading it was at the highest.
However, in charge of business advisors highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the banking language "fixed income", there is a huge compensation for large banks.
The UBS has empty in American mortgage products.
To fill these empty, the UBS started an adventure that almost costs it its existence.
Due to growth, they invested both the same bank and one of its high-risk funds created in high-risk U.S. investments.
It was transformed into a powerful machine to securitize American mortgage credits and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, like other banks, they sought the drop for a long time.
“In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave because the attempt to order was more complicated than they expected.
UBS positions became projectable seats and are unsafe to date.
Currently, who runs a big bank has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, a bank expert, has an idea to end the investment bank, focus on property management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to get so far ( yet).
But investment banks must decrease a lot, it is clear today.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present its future strategy to the world.
In fact, it was only thought of the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss as a transitional solution, as the bank was surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he imposed himself: He must permanently lead the business of the UBS, the bank of Zurich said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
Remove 3,500 positions.
But this isn't enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is currently asked.
To date, he only says he will first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.

What created skepticism among U.S. investors: “We are not an island, if not dependent,” said Steve Goldman from Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be released so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this precaution, it is still unclear if Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview with the CNBC.
Therefore, from its point of view, it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.

Smart grates spread in cities
In many places the grass is considered "problematic birds": these very intelligent animals from cities are not expelled for a long time, the experts say.
Some like, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the grasses have been belonging to the picture of the city for years, but in many municipalities the complaints of neighbors are accumulated for the fuckingness and noise of animals.
Although no means has appeared against the "problematic birds" so far.
The grass no longer leave cities, say experts in the first symposium on grass in Leer, Eastern Frisia.
There specialists across the national territory discuss possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected grease fields; chemical applications in agriculture visiblely end up with traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, growing building, and falling trees that hosts them make birds difficult to live.
The grass is protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 reproductive couples in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Read.
There in 2005, a controversial project jumped to the negative press holders to mass kill the district's grass.
Critics have qualified animal hunting through birds traps and sticks killing as especially brutal.
"By expelling them and fleeing them normally, nothing is achieved," said Werner Klöver, a urbanist and landscapelist from Leer.
Shooting nests with water or throwing trees are often unwanted consequences, also says Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert at Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals displace, large colonies split and distribute elsewhere."
Away from them is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, elderly residences or schools.
“We have to live with them, we don’t catch them anymore.”
Without the surrounding areas, the problem is not solved in cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, Mayor of Leer.
A combination of fleeing animals from sensitive residential areas and strains is possible to resettle elsewhere.
"Informative panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, a psychologist and ethnolog makes advertising against in order to treat animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can stand a peak in the face with aplom."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on Ascheberger’s grass, where letters report about the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on birds' noise criticism: "All are forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, grays not only take advantage of resources to access squirts, but they make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologues at Cambridge University checked in four steps how far the intelligence of birds comes to.
In an experiment, birds quickly learned that they should drop a stone on a platform to reach a poultry larva.
Without much training, they determined the size and shape that the stone should have to fall on the platform.
In a second essay, the clever grays had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a poultry larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with the peak.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube on the tube shooter.
Three of the four grays got it in the first attempt.
Portugal in the 2012 Euro Cup thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and Turks have no hopes in the championship.
Favorites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in the 2012 Euro Cup.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed in the play-offs the latest Euro 2012 tickets in Poland and Ukraine.
Guided by the triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal scored Bosnia and Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after 0-0 of the one-to-one match, made the five participations of the Euro Cup.
The Czechs won 1-0 (0-0) in the play-offs back match with the outsider Montenegro, after in the one-way match (2-0) left things clear.
Croatia did not allow him to mark in 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland achieved a 1-1 (1-0) flaw against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other goals of Portugal.
The former Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) shortened distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic obtained a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 play-offs of the world of South Africa.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal began perfectly.
Ronaldo runs a direct free for more than 30 meters to get his head at the points.
A quarter of hours later, Nani showed his dots to score from away and achieved 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who didn’t succeed in the first half an hour, had their first clear opportunity thanks to goller Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg team player, English leader Manchester City sent a header to the stick, but the ball did not cross the port line (33.).
Jiracek hit for the Czech Republic
Then collegiate Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was in the hurricane's eye.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnia Penati area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark pushed a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which transformed Misimovic.
After the rest, the 2004 European vice champion declared everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended the last doubt in the 81. minute with Petr Jiracek goal.
The 1976 European champion ranked for the fifth consecutive for the European Cup.
Coach Michal Bilek’s team with Bundesliga Legionary Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, gate guard Petr Cech avoided with a reflection a possible goal at Tomas Sivok's own gate (9.).
Montenegro had more chances with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic marked at the 40th minute of the frontal turn, very just in the port of Cech.
After the rest, the Czechs had to protect the leaker from the world-famous gatekeeper, the frontman of FC Seoul escaped again (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the match.
Meanwhile, Turkey missed the wonder of Zagreb’s football.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass from 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost sure that national coach Guus Hiddink had to leave his seat from the 2002 World Third Bank, the Croatians celebrated their fourth participation in the final of the European Cup.
Before 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost achieved a dream principle.
In the seventh minute and with a long-distance drop, Selcuk Inan only touched the post, and the attacker Kazim Kazim couldn't send the ball inside the port.
After the second reaction, Croatia was increasingly controlled.
After the break, Croatia did not let him get any goals.
Alongside Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62th minute placed Ivan Perisic, from Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern of Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the Bundesliga legionaries in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the Euro Cup
In Dublin, the Irish have celebrated the first participation in the European Cup since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni’s team, who triumphed with 4-0 in the one-way match prepared for a prior decision, put himself in head in the 32 minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) hit the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23th minute, when Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had his first great opportunity.
From the beginning, the Estonian defense avoided possible goals of advantage.
In the 32nd minute, he went forward.
Following a defense from gate guard Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and shot the ball through the line, achieving 1-0.

Massacre at personal level
The intense and generous new book of Peter Englund, The Beauty and the Pain of Battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about the First World War, "begins with a long dramatic person of the type that can make one’s soul fall at the feet.
Here are some action tips: Softly start this page and turn it into your brand pages.
It will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund’s novel narrative, and this dramatic person will work as his GPS, a lighthouse during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, is confused and unpaid in the war’s fog.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, awarding the Nobel Prize for Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which describes, correctly, as "an anti-history work."
It contains some remarkable names, important treaties or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or materials.
It’s not as much a book about what happened, he explains, as “a book about how it happened.” It’s about “ feelings, impressions, experiences, and mood states.”
The beauty and pain of the battle combines experiences in war times of more than 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanicals to climbers, doctors, ambulance and administrative drivers.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, become crazy or die.
Their lives blind here as votive candles on fire in a church; some new are added to the mix while others turn off.
The book of Mr. Englund is a deviation from standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that the First World War was only the funeral trinch war on the western front.
"The beauty and pain of battle" moves expertly through other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on the groves; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flights are an intratable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, a hurricane Katrina that strikes the cordite.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, are you left or flee?
Anyway, who comes?
Almost no one understands what is happening, nor even why this war has to fight.
"Lack of facts," observes Mr. Englund, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and pain of battle" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the high sea fleet.
His stories have been obtained in most memories, letters and other material already published previously.
The explanations of their lives can be frightening or moving, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about deprivations and to arrange them with what there is.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl says: "Successions, everywhere successions."
"Coffee scenario, false aluminum, imitation rubber, paper sales, wood buttons."
He continues to talk about successive food in Germany.
It describes "meat made of cooked rice and pressed in sheep fat (and removed with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of roots and dry potatoes; shoes with wooden soles."
There are, notes, "837 meat substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and value.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards wildlife and manifests about war: "You feel that, after all, this is for what men are designed and not to sit in chairs with a cigarette and a whisky, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretending that that barnish means civilization and that there is no barbar behind that pech and starch."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will know or care.
“Once one resigns to the thought of sacrificing oneself, one would like to think it could happen in front of the public,” he writes.
Instead, it is horribly similar to "a convicted being strangled in secret."
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
“The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition,” writes Englund, “a war between factories.”
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the beastrium of the young century: The eloquent and ideologically convinced mass murderer with good-confectioned clothes that runs his flesh as he sits behind a desk."
People behave in unexpected ways; there is both noble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund talks about the soldiers who actively tried to catch a prostitute veneral illness as a way to avoid service on the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and embark their genitals in hope to end in the hospital,” he writes.
“Those who are truly desperate frot him over their eyes, which often leads to a blindness for life.”
In this Swedish translation made by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr. Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, it reflects the way in which the war “disappeared exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People are starting to ask why their leaders are fighting them.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and the modern memory of Paul Fussell, or novels like No Novelty in the front of Erich Maria Remarque, rather than comprehensive stories.
Mr. Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating ends I can remember in a work of non-fiction.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he'd arrived from his book, pushed out of your fingers that dramatic person page, and burned it with a crack.
After a previous fake step, a planned assault at the minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing anti-disorder helmets.
On Monday night was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-range officers, initially telling others that they were joining an exercise.
Police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the center, his presence underlined how the operation was challenging for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, such as spray spraying pepper over protesters, violating the department’s rules and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the “okups.”
And this is why the police operation to clear the Zuccotti park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared themselves to see how occupations had been developed in other cities.
A major catastrophe simulator was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye looking towards Zuccotti.
The agents increased the so-called disorder training – anti-terrorism measures that involved quickly mobilizing a large number of police officers – to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to enter the park arrived in the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "an exercise".
“To the few policemen I know who were called for this, they didn’t tell them that it was to enter the Zuccotti Park,” said the person, who spoke anonymously.
“The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department.”
A reason for secretism was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, agents wanted to clear the park, but they gave up when hundreds of demonstrators emerged earlier after they heard about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved officers from several police units, including special forces from all over the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who usually flooded neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said a lot of people, like those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to enter.
"It was appropriate to do it when the smallest number of people were in the park," he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Service Unit with focus and speakers gathered at the Pike Slip cross with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The pre-recorded lights and messages that rebuckled from the speakers seemed to intimidate many demonstrators.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue windshields, many demonstrators simply picked up their things and went away.
No shop was touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving demonstrators time to pick up their belongings.
Other agent teams were seen gathering in the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave it.
Paul J. Browne, Chief Spokesman of the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said they were trying to prevent the police from entering into action in the park, and they had been suddenly treated by the agents.
Mr. Browne said that the mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture pictures.
As police moved west through the dense marble of personal effects of the protesters, including luggage and waste bags of paper and plastic clothing, Cleaning Department equipment followed them, collecting what was left behind.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were dragged out, pictures appearing on the Internet shortly afterwards.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp’s kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police entered to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people at the epicenter of the camp were singing between them by their arms.
And two people tied up to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service agents were called to cut the candles.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The dropping operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Browne said some 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were due to "alteration of public order and resistance to authority," he said.
The highest-range agent on the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the head of the department, the senior uniform officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's detective chief, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, as he was present, “was not running the operations,” said Mr. Browne.
A second group of agents awaited along the eastern side of Broadway, between the Liberty and Cedar streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were raised in Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond the Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were some 28 people in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most noisy action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a demonstrator jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen removing the air from the wheels of a police van.
In a given moment, a piece of countershade came out flying from the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
The union of support workers will demand the city for dismissals
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that the dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The demand is possibly the last weapon available to the union of the 37 municipal district, in its effort to revoke the dismissals.
Six hundred seventy-two school assistants, parents coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid in the city lost their work on October 7, in a movement that trade union leaders have described as a political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, the city’s access to a health care fund charged by working groups to close their budgetary break.
Municipal authorities have categorically denied that accusation.
At an audience at the City Hall last month, education counselor Dennis M. Walcott said the dismissals were part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council counter-attacked saying that nothing in the budget specifyed that school support staff members would be dismissed.
37 municipal district officials said they filed the claim in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be charged. A press conference will be held Wednesday to announce the official presentation of the lawsuit at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as accused, and has eight workers dismissed as claimants, all black or Latin women, as well as most attendees who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the Legal Department of the City, said the city had not seen the demand and therefore could not comment on her specific allegations.
According to a draft of the New York Times claim, the union has focused on the number of dismissals in the city’s poor areas schools to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying poor schools have lost more attendees, since they had been insufficiently subsidized chronicly.
Although there were no dismissals in Staten Island and a few dismissals in schools at Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school attendees lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were dismissed in Districts 8 and 9 in Southern Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight attendees employed by the 36 Public School in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the demand says, "This is not a neighborhood of adherenced parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. District 36 budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each poor student enrollment in schools.
The union also states that secondary school directors may have been deceived by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parents coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "excedent" to describe the action, although "excedent" most often describes the act of moving a teacher from a school to a workforce, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Seventy-six parents coordinators were fired," the complaint draft says, "and not only in surplus."
Mission ended, Congress prepared to reach an agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was that the rebellion succeeds, that the veteran dictator Muamar the Gaddafi was captured and killed, and the participation of the United States came to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (democrat by Massachusetts), along with senators John McCain (Republican by Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent of Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops.
"This resolution is to honor the brave of Libya, starting to reconstruct their country," Kerry said.
"It is a statement of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy until now.
This summer, the legislators of both parties were fighting each other and with the White House about the drafting of a series of resolutions to pass or reject the role of U.S. military in NATO’s mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide range of bipartisan margins, which never came to vote in the Senate.
But the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut the funds for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a sort of legislative purgatory - with Congress annoying enough to criticize Obama’s mission’s handling, but not as angry as to actually graze the grass under his feet.
Then the Congress’s indecision was overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
NATO’s mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves" and "praises the men and women of the US Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure gain full support from the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it share legislators as it did in the bill of June?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indian), the committee's main Republican.
The spokesman of Lugar said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually achieves a vote of the entire assembly in the House or the Senate at this Congress.
Other legislators have so far not succeeded in bringing their amendments to the Assembly, but not because of lack of attempts.
The Goodlatte is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced to this Congress, which cover a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicate - the same bill is proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others with slight variations each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment only in the House, and another handful that "will control federal spending."
Some of these bills are also identical to each other, but give their sponsors - especially beginning Republicans seeking to refine their curriculums - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors" of that measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote for a budget balance amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms that Congress members can fulfill, while Representative José E. Serrano (Democratic for New York) wants to remove the limit of two terms for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democratic by Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment prohibiting homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as a amendment prohibiting flag burning.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of states.
So enthusiasts that members have been in proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At 111 Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 in 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s, when the members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they didn’t succeed much more then than they have it now.
The last amendment added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Hit but not defeated," Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman fired him in a constituent act in Tucson, representative Gabrielle Giffords (Arizona Democratic) appeared on national television Monday night, sang accompanied by Broadway's melody "The Sun will come out tomorrow" and said he wanted to recover more than he wanted to return to Congress.
In her appearance in ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented his difficult path back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and perforated the left side of his brain, and that passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned to the House by surprise to issue his triumphant vote in the debt roof agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, rivered and sang - and described his recovery as "tough."
When Sawyer asked him how he feels, 41-year-old Giffords answered, “It’s enough well.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special one-hour "20/20" program, which was issued on the eve of the publication of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special program analyzed the recovery of Giffords since the shooting of 8 January.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first weeks, she sees her in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar crossing her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers up, while her husband encourages her.
Months later, you see Giffords sitting on a wheelchair while the therapists teach you how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A frustration of the lips.
And then his first word: "What."
In a few days, Giffords pronounced another word - "stop", a request for change in his breakfast menu.
Videos released by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: He sees congressman singing along with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, two hours ago therapy every day, he said he doesn’t remember the day of shooting.
Her husband said he was reading to Giffords a newspaper article about the murder of March 12 when she arrested him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is arrested in a Missouri prison and is being medicated by force while waiting for trial.
"Many people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I told him, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
"You've just been hit.
And you're going to get out of this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back more powerfully than ever."
The troops make it more sorry than respect.
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators and marine infants broke into their positions around him.
The crowd of labels stood up and applaud.
“The men and women were considered as heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the collection of spring funds.
A high-ranking military officer in the gala, also known as then President of the Joint Major State, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They showed them as a kind of orphan child,” the officer wrote in an email.
I am sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The distinctly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken over the military and an American public often distant, sometimes worshipper.
He is prodiged to the troops with praise for his sacrifices.
But praise has a price, the members of the service say.
The audience is increasingly acting as if they are punished by those uniforms.
"We are not victims at all," brigade general Sean B. MacFarland said, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon leave to Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way some show their support is to put ourselves in the role of unrest souls.”
The topic is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, who do not want to seem disgraced or disagreed with the audience they serve.
They also realize that the anger facing the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most talks about pity take place in silence and privately among war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting the Navy Infantry, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder whether there would be a "angry and violent veteran under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his job search, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him whether he would be able to stand under the pressure of a demanding Washington work immediately after his combat tour.
“When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions,” Cancian recalled by telling their children.
Military concern arises, in part, from American indifference to wars.
The achievements in the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits from the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in World War II,” said retired General Lieutenant David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praises of politicians and the public focus largely on the depth of the suffering of a service member.
Troops are recognized by the number of tours they have supported, the number of friends they have lost, or the scope of their injuries.
Army faces increasing pressure to end rape
This week, a historic audience will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passivity to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
First soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a companion.
It was October 2008, and he went back to his headquarters at the Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague with a package of 12 cans of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room to drink a drink.
"It sounded an alarm signal," Lyman says.
The Texas native, however, left her concern aside.
I thought, no, it's 19.
"It's Texas," he says.
"I wish I had heard my instincts."
In the few minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached him from behind, shooting her down and raping her, he claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military staff members look forward to a judgment in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit they have filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in reducing the widespread rape among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Submitted in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially involved 17 claimants, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their colleagues, and that the army failed in investigating, prosecuting, or imparting adequate justice after their complaints.
Burke says he goes by the largest plane of the army, because the problem begins with them.
“The army is a structure from up to down,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals? High command."
Burke also says that since February, nearly 400 more survivors have been in touch with her, many of whom could be part of future demands.
Its strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs into the same basket, so to say, it will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, headed by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy - essentially, that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries suffered in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court judgment called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by active staff.
"The alleged damages are part of the military service of the complainants," the documents say.
The Department of Defense refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, women’s soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in reaching local women in war zones.
The result: among these two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two-thirds of them have died in combat situations.
It’s time for the army to modernize, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are on, besides hers.
At the Yale Faculty of Law, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a Missogyn environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is making a lawsuit against the army that focuses on the diagnosis of “disorder of personality” assigned to the victims of rape in order to give them the high service – a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network in Service, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration in December, accusing her of discriminatory practices in the way it handles claims for benefits for people who claim to have been sexually abused in service.
Nine bills have been presented separately at Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010 there were 3,158 sexual assaults reported, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault and Response of the Department of Defense.
However, the aggressions are noticeably reported below, and by Pentagon's estimates itself, which amounts to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents occurring that year.
The report, published in March, also examines prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the army went to trial - half than in the civil justice system.
The complainants in Burke’s case, describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman’s case, he denounced the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he says, she was asked to tell the details of her rape 11 times distinct to a multitude of police officers, doctors, and commanders.
She was subjected to a rape kit, and the blood of her aggressor - of a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended an hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having had sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people declared witnesses of personality on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally absolved.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to work," I found myself screaming from the room.
“They put me in the psychiatry unit, and when I left, I remember that I told my commander, ‘That was not your judgment, that was my judgment.’”
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a personality disorder, which made her not fit for service.
In January 2010, he was dispensed from service under less than honorable terms, which prevents him from receiving any benefits.
As to whether the case submitted by Lyman and his colleagues continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, Law Professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he says, “In my opinion, they should be able to move forward.”
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was published for the first time.
I have been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence that raises responsibility.
And he adds, "The odds are strongly against them...but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn’t go his way, Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, will put his other hundreds of plaintiffs on the tail for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this topic until the reform takes place," he says.
Or until we die, what happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another type that aired his online anti-immigration views.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having killed in Norway in July, leaving 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from being alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time before his attack on his computer, talking to some of the millions of nationalists who support the right groups on social media.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We realized that it was not so difficult to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British Demos Studies Center.
Facebook’s personal information alignment is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy - the way vendors have been using for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans from right-wing groups across Europe and then directed ads to them, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future.
By reaching Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 extreme-right matches in 11 European countries – all without leaving the office.
“It’s a completely new way of doing an investigation,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, men and angry by immigration.
However, in a sort of turn, “those who combine their activism in line with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind the computer screen.”
DEMOS’ work is just an example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends as expressed in "I like", wall messages and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook’s “data-new” is generating an increase in research, boosting the number of academic jobs with the name of the site in the title up to nearly 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, Facebook’s beauty is that it allows you to study people you couldn’t get closer with a folder on the street.
“Before, when you tried to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You would have to go through the game, and they would never allow you access,” Bartlett says.
"Facebook removes all that - you're going to them directly."
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address social health problems.
A recent study conducted by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues found that college students who talked about their Facebook drinking acts had a significantly greater risk of having problems with the drink than students who remained silent on the topic.
Moreno suggests that student colleagues, such as residential advisors, could control the site and intervene to help a student publish too many state updates with their drinks.
“You can’t treat a problem if you can’t diagnose it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Child’s Center for Health, Behaviour and Development at the Seattle Child Research Institute, Washington Post.
“We have found a way to identify risky children that would otherwise not be diagnosed.”
Facebook is also constantly "pinking" its own population to obtain data.
The site Data Team has prepared statistics on the status of relationship and Valentine’s Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that can be accessed - advocates of digital freedom long ago that argue that the site should make available to other large amounts of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, like them or not - the sacrifice of being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of kilometers away is allowing the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
“I don’t think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociolog at the London Knowledge Laboratory, on a 2006 study conducted with the public walls of students Facebook.
"In what they concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research issue is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of the profile information of a user and the wall messages are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
That’s why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a cap and a pen remain the best research tools that no one can use.
“There is no substitute to enter the real world and talk to the real people,” he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social - and a lot of social happens still offline."
Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to be the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Templar Knights of Norway,” he said in a full room with 500 people.
"I oppose the court because it has received the mandate of organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but I don't declare myself guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because “it didn’t want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform for it to express its views.”
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address his victims' relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and family members of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came with the hope of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that he is locked under key.
They all attended with the aim of moving forward to the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," a survivor from Utoya told Norwegian NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after I saw and heard the suspect."
Dressed with a dark and blue cloth, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik’s strange notion of being part of a higher “resistance” movement, the judge determined that he is not a mentally ill, and said there is no evidence that he was acting with complices.
Some may consue that the attacks of July 22 appear to be a work of an extremist instead of a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically smooth the pain and confusion that a whole nation still feels.
“I would like it to look like a monster, but it doesn’t seem like it,” a victim’s family member said.
"It would be much easier if it looked like it."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview, Shown in a Theatre This Week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, there were some who compared him with Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find more revealing, in a recently rediscovered Jobs interview that has been powdered as an advance of a series of special projections in the biggest markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the commercial processes and workflows of products.
He was undoubtedly a designer, dreamer and self-recognized hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a yonki of flow diagrams - a man who believed many executives suffered "a disease consisting of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringly was developing The Triumph of the Nerds television series over the early days of the personal computer, and sitting for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time, they had passed scarcely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensely in his new NeXT computer company, waiting for popular internet adoption.
While a small part of Cringely’s interview was used in Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during his transportation.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full copy of VHS was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly reedited file material is the basis of Steve Jobs: The lost 68-minute interview, which arrives at Landmark cinemas on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly heavy his thoughts, looking for accuracy.
There are also times when Jobs’ perfectionism goes to the surface, where it seems impatient due to Cringly’s questions, pushing him to go faster towards the topics or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there’s something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and bad, and offers their own vision of the future of computer science.
One thing is to read posthumous Jobs’ career assessments, but there’s something raw and inspiring in the Jobs we see here, the dreamer anxious to the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, it was and did it.
A quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to take a business:
Throughout the years in the business, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers that give you invariably are, "Oh, that's just the way you do."
No one knows why he does what he does, no one thinks very deeply about things in business.
That's what I found.
Jobs leads to detail their efforts to simplify Apple’s accounting.
Disturbed by how costs were registered - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made to the eye of good cube, and then adjusted with a "variable" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that commercial costs could be determined in detail.
About the joke to the Pope:
Jobs tells the "Blue Box" he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
It has been widely written about the device, but Jobs’ euphoria here when describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tried the box using a public phone, calling a call, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
“We were wrapping things around the world a half a dozen times and you were screaming through the public phone and returning to the public phone a minute later from the next door,” Jobs says with a laughter.
“We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
We two, we didn't know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing - it was an amazing lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking for talking to the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two broke in carcasses just before the Pope was awakened to go to answer the phone.
About getting in love with technology (and sale by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, at the hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone guide and made a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs achieved a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
“That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and formed my vision of what a company was and how well they treated its employees.”
Jobs then became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first table computer ever made.”
It was as large as a suitcase, had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and would waste time with that machine and write programs for her.
About Improving Innovation:
At several points of the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the march.
Soon in his career, as he was dedicated to selling a handful of base boards, a customer asked him if he could mount the entire team.
Working with only 30 credit days, I had to find out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, as he was on Apple, he remembers the struggles he faced in the development of a computer mouse:
“I remember having dramatic arguments... I shouted that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I get tired and went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
About large companies losing strength:
Much before he led Apple’s rebirth, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble in their vision, and lose control of their market share.
"Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better photocopiers and printers, and what?"
You have the monopoly of market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so they are this kind of people who end up leading companies and products responsible are expelled from the forum for decision-making.
The genius of the products that led to that monopoly position is powdered because of people who don’t have the notion of good products vs. bad products – the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the whole computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been Microsoft in the 1990s...
They took the defeat of victory.
Innovation as an artistic expression:
“There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to do - some things you can't make the electrons do, the glass does, the robots do, the factories do.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
Ultimately everything is reduced to taste - it is reduced to try to expose you to the best a human team has done, and then try to adapt those things you are doing to.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have never been ashamed of stealing great ideas.
What partly made the Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were casually the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, I might be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with the rivals of the healthcare law while the court accepts the case
On the day the Supreme Court gathered on closed doors to examine the politically controversial issue of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama’s health care law, two of his magistrates, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were taken away at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will exhibit the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a claim filed by 26 states challenging the total reform of health care approved by Congress last year, a law that has been a war crime for conservative activists across the country.
The judges agreed to admit to process the lawsuit and, in fact, a historical allegation of 5 and a half hours is expected for March, and the outcome will probably even further disturb the 2012 presidential race, which will be in peak at the time the court’s decision is known.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the law should be rejected will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. general prosecutor during George W. Bush’s government.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped sponsor the Federalist Society’s annual dinner, a group that has been dedicated to the defense of conservative legal principles for many years.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the commercial associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held in a hotel in Washington, hours after the court’s preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the assistants was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law.
Special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And it’s not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, the judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they weren’t, it could be said that they would fall under Canon Code 4C, which says: “A judge can attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge cannot be a speaker, an honor guest, or appear in the program of such event.”
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm ethical activists in the government.
“This impressive ethical gap and indifference towards the code goes against the lawsuits of several judges who comply with the court by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges were tackled in a collection of gala funds with lawyers who have pending cases before the court."
Its appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and it is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticisms that say they mix the court’s activity too easily with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is an outstanding conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives argue that it is Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as a prosecutor-general for the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
His critics have pressured Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying he was too involved in defending the law as to now be impartial.
Kagan hasn't given any indication that he's going to do it.
Boeing Receives Record Order of $18 Billion
The Emirates airline demands 50 Boeing 777 double-hall aircraft, with 20 more options.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation worth more than $1 billion.
It is rarely news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.
But it is a big transaction when the company is the Boeing Co. aircraft manufacturer and the sale price for the 50 aircraft is up to a record of $18 billion.
It is as large as the place where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years Middle East airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its biggest order in history for commercial aircraft for its value in dollars - 50 double-hall Boing 777 jets.
The successful order came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total sale price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the Dubai Aeronautical Hall 2011.
On Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, who presume fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The sales price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing," Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora said.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by their oil producing nations.
Therefore, they not only have the money to pay aircraft, but a rise in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so harmful, because the country is making money with the rise in oil prices.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
The order of the Emirates strengthens Boeing’s leadership in the wide fuselage aircraft market and helps keep the attempt of its competitor Airbus SAS to invade its domain with the A350 passenger aircraft.
Boeing’s victory at the air fair occurs four months after Airbus said it would delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more boost after customers required an increase in useful load and range.
Boeing Co’s shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico, seemingly defeated in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa María Calderón claims that drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the fight for governor.
President Felipe Calderón's sister seems to have lost her candidate for Governor of Michoacán during the violent state elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers helped incline the race in favor of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the Western state to Fausto Vallejo, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
“The intervention of organized crime throughout the election process and, above all, yesterday is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country,” Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview one day after the Sunday vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... they seized the urns, installed barricades... and ordered people to vote" in favour of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until he lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the stage of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI is hoping to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have little overcome Calderón, who had led the surveys before the elections.
Calderón, a candidate of his brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, currently held as governor, remained third, a great defeat for the divided left and unfortunate prior to the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, an ex-mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links with drug trafficking and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines.
It is President Calderón’s home state, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the elections while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates abandoned local candidates for fear.
Although for the PRI, for the unpleasant appearance of Michoacan’s elections, a victory will help drive the match.
The man supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, from next year."
BAsD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has appealed to India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, Chief Executive Officer of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, said the world’s two largest fastest growing economies had to “do everything possible” to accelerate the recovery of the economic block either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) countries that observe Europe’s difficulties in an “impartial” way and said that Asia’s financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all together in this."
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview under the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune."
“So if China and India can help, let it be by any means.”
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s debt costs have dangerously dropped and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased the fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to join together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that any Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater negotiation power for Asian partners in Europe.
Indian Trade Minister Anand Sharma said “India will do everything possible” to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering the drop in exports and exhaustion of foreign capital inputs.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
“It’s not an option, it’s an imperative, because where we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women.”
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to sell the aid to Europe for the billions of two hundred thousand people in India, of which up to 800 million live with about $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on holiday to the beaches and that will not be fine," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous well-paid workers in the Greek public sector, in jobs of poorly managed companies, and loss generators such as railways.
Mr. Nag said the crisis in the eurozone threatens with “important chain effects” across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank’s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces “low risks” due to the threat of Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make “contingency plans” to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outputs from their economies.
Serious warnings from the Pentagon about possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary León Panetta warmed Congress on Monday, warning that coming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and lead to a chain financial reaction from Pentagon’s corridors to Afghanistan’s battlefields to civil assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already dividing $450 billion in reductions over the next decade, but now fears an additional 600 billion or more reduction in cuts that may be imminent if Congress failed to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department,” Panetta told Senator John McCain, Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican for South Carolina in a letter.
He said the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "kidnapping", would result in 23 percent of global reductions and a lot of new projects.
“Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate manner, would make most of our naval and construction projects cannot be executed – three-quarters of a ship or building cannot be purchased – and seriously damaged other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to the senators.
“We would also be forced to remove many of our civilian officials involuntarily, and because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost sure that we would have to license civilians in order to achieve the goal.”
“These changes would break the faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage good willingness.”
The cuts over time would reach the fighting troops, Panetta said.
"While the financing for wartime in overseas contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by the abduction, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disorders in basic budgets," Panetta warned.
“Hiring staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of the contract that supports war.”
“Wage staff would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers in wartime, and legal and political support would be interrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the potential impact of automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would cause a rapid decline in the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
“We are firmly against this draconian action,” the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta’s letter.
“This is not a result you can live with, and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves.”
“Kidnapping is a threat to the interests of the U.S. national security, and it should not be allowed to happen.”
If Panetta’s letter and senators’ recent warnings will increase pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts is to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly frank about possible cuts, although he reached a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budget experience in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defense Secretary painted a dark picture of what he could be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a boat without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of quarters, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers capable of fulfill the mission," Panetta said in her opening words in the Pentagon.
“It is a force that suffers from low morality, poor preparation and is not able to stay up to date with potential adversaries.”
"In fact, he invites to aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta states new details of how reductions “generate significant operational risks: delay in the response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and previously committed worldwide; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
The list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighter, a new planned bomber, the new-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal fighter ship and the new land fighter vehicle that the Army and the Navy need to replace, the humee.
Stopping the development and additional testing of the F35 could generate around $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step to improve and face the potential threats of China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the most recent titles tells us how serious and omnipresent are deception and lie in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each party accuses of lying to the other.
Administrators of Pennsylvania State University have been accused of perjury for allegedly hiding reports that said a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was "sturbed" with an open microphone claiming to U.S. President Barack Obama, that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lie has destroyed races and convulsed countries.
Congressman for New York and exhibitionist on the Internet, Anthony Weiner, made the ridiculous with his quickly denied dismissed by the irrefutable test.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of offences in the financing of the campaign related to covering an extramarital relationship.
And again, no one who lived him will never forget the media circus released by President Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about traps in school and college exams are widespread.
Cases have been given in which teachers have given the exams responses to students in order to be best seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending the message that lying and deceiving are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
On any day, studies show you can lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That's sure, many of those lies are godly lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of knowing each other.
Detecting lies, or “location of lies,” is an essential skill we must acquire all for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a table game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim, "I have you," detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the past six decades at prestigious universities that carried out in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that old myths about lie have been rebuckled.
The liars look at their eyes.
Not always tartamudeans, balbuceans, rubbish or disturb themselves.
It is also not possible to conclude that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lies detector can reach the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, question formation, and times.
I spent several years looking at scientific discoveries about deception in the vast, ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate through our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, or negotiations management.
Good liars have the ability to read others well, making them feel comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know by research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more "self-oriented lies," while women say more lies "towards others" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less frequently to their partners than people who are not married (but the lies that they usually say tend to be normal).
We also know that if you are perceived as an evildoer, others will feel less guilty by lying to you.
How do I know if someone is lying?
First, observe the usual behavior of the subject.
This is called "create a baseline."
It helps to provide reference points to measure changes afterwards.
Watch the subject’s position, laugh and voice feature.
It’s better to know if someone normally hits his foot all the time to not make unfair allegations when he sees his feet hitting in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for misleading, verbal and non-verbal behavior groups.
Consider these behavior groups as alarm signals, not as a deceit proof.
People who deceive can frozen the upper part of the body by trying to remember their story, can point their feet towards the door, tilt towards an outlet, significantly change their position, or display a "post-interview decay" -- that exaggerated relief and posture change once all difficult questions have finished.
Interrogators often make falsely see that the interview has finished only to seek that post-interview relief.
Also pay attention to the subject’s vocabulary.
Scott Peterson pushed her foot to the bottom and used the past time as he claimed his killed wife was alive, launching a search for her at the national level.
People who deceive can also use a distance language: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when he answers a difficult question: "Well... to say true... until what I... to my understanding."
This makes the answer a perception instead of a fact and is often an alert signal.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but develop skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s possibilities to avoid being victimized by the artists of scam in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial oil pipe plan deviated after the threat of U.S. delay in its approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angrying unions, while calming the ecologists -- the company seeking to build the oil pipeline says he is ready to redirect the project to redirect it.
TransCanada said on Monday night that the planned oil pipe will move outside the environmentally sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and is confident that the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference at the Capitol of Nebraska.
TransCanada’s manager Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that over time the oil pipeline will be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This comes after the State Department’s announcement last week that they would delay the decision by a federal permission for the project until new potential routes are being studied that avoid the areas of Sandhills in Nebraska and the aquarium Ogallala, a vast supply of groundwater.
“This is a true way of progress,” Nebraska Republican representative Lee Terry told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is possible to separate any decision until 2013, after next year’s elections, although officials denied that policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the Department of State, and expressed all his support to them.
The oil pipeline, 1,700 kilometers, would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would bring 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do so, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by ecologists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the oil pipeline.
But Nebraska’s legislators opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a distance from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's current environmental impact study found that the project only posed limited environmental adverse impacts, but the source of the energy industry said the department's general inspector has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign advisor in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is if a firm that was hired to direct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused of supposedly causing a child to vomit from fear
A family in New York states that the diva of album music, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a crazy in the lobby of her Manhattan building, landing her little daughter to the point that she vomited from fear.
Lady Marmalade's singer's diaphragm frightened Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, both he suffered "change of personality, sleep disorders" and "increased his fear of strangers," says his family at the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when tramwayist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a childhood garden teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with his luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone came behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes, and I went to catch her," he said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman angry.
"He said in an aggressive tone, 'I shouldn't have left her daughter near the door," Roseanna Monk said.
I said, “I have no interest in what you say or think.”
He was angry and began to use bad words - the word C and the word J in loud voice...
I had a bottle of water and it began to throw the water from the bottle over me.”
He said Genevieve became hysterical.
“I told this woman, ‘Look what you have done to my daughter,’” said the girl’s mother.
LaBelle sparkled over her mother -- who still subjected Genevieve -- and had to be contained by her surrounding and withdrawn from a car waiting for her, said Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so strong that she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for LaBelle's apology, but she didn't get an answer.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representatives did not return the calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damage, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he picked up the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money to an association supporting children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for her behavior," Davis said.
“This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it targets a childhood garden teacher who takes a 18-month-old child in arms.”
Climate adversity breaks the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez’s management, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality has increased, dropped foreign investment and the economy has contracted.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in Sinaloa’s economic history, it is the first year of Mario López Valdez’s self-called government, which generated great expectations towards economic advances, but given the starting climate adversity of the year, there is no growth, instead a deterioration in key economic development indicators.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millionary losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a general economic activity decline of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified primarily by the historical fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report of ice-affects issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582,835 hectares were damaged, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent had partial damage, the main sinistered crops were vegetables, corn and garbano.
The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in state unemployment, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated rate of 749% from compared to the average rate of January to March 55,053 signalians were unemployed, with a ratered ratening ratening ratency ratency ratency ratency ratency ratency ratency ratency.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been taken from public policy.
“What is seen is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market for the effects of a resource restriction by legislation adopted at the congress to fight money laundering, as well as for people who grab dollars illicitly is not easy for you to work, invest and use them in something,” he said.
Migration arrested
López Cervantes noted that in the increase in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
“The number of people leaving the state in search of work abroad, in the United States, has been restricted, first by the difficulties in entering, and second because entering has also many difficulties in finding job, those people are staying and demanding sources of work here in the state, which makes unemployment rise,” he said.
Informality
The analysis of the Signoense labour market is worsened by considering the high level of informality predominant among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the occupied population in the state works without being quoted as a worker in front of any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state’s labour retreats are low wages, the entity has the lowest remuneration in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Forecast.
The average monthly income of Signoense workers was, until September, 5,000,352 pesos, much below the national average, located at 7,375 pesos.
Contraction of IED
In addition to the decline in economic activity and increase in unemployment, the largest decline in foreign direct investment in the past 10 years is recorded in 2011, according to the Secretariat for Economics from January to June of the State IED sumed $630,697, which represents a decline of 87.74 percent from the previous period of $5,143 billion 312.
On the other hand, the State Government’s Secretariat for Economic Development accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion pesos over the year, mainly from companies in the third sector.
Debt
In front of the scenario of economic contraction, the state government in July requested the state congress to approve a credit for 3 billion pesos, even that would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the state congress was for a amount of 2,6 billion pesos, and until November have not seen the benefits of the deblock sector.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of Mario López Valdés’ Government shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said in 2011 he lacked the harmonisation of the wills of the various sectors, including the government itself.
“The performance of the economy in Sinaloa this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensely to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, align everyone’s effort and above all the already synchronized good march of this new government team, we hope next year will be much better,” he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events like early-year ice cream stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
“Low economic flow is the result of several events, including ice creams, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that doesn’t turn quickly enough to generate economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year, we’re closed much below the expectations we had,” he said.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Mexican Patronal Confederation in Sinaloa, said it is required to cause the state towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that it has been working, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme in which the state's vocation and economic direction are redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated," he said.
Work to do
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a future vision that better focuses on the efforts of the Government.
"In general, I would say that the government has been striving to bring good results in different matters, there are some progress in economic development, but it is important that a long-term programme will be developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its way of leading public policy.
"There are elements that allow to say that the government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
Condemned for 8 kg of marijuana
Five years of prison and 100 days of fine was sentenced to a Navolato neighbor for possession of eight pounds of marijuana.
The Prosecutor-General of the Republic reported that the convicted narcomanerist is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in her variant of possession of marijuana for trade purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite pole 80, in El Castillo, Navolato.
The narcomenologist was circulating in a pick-up, white-color truck, where it carried a black bag in the vehicle’s box and in the copilot’s seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For such reasons, he was insured to be available to the Second District Judge and the sentenced remained internal at the Centre for Enforcement of Crime Legal Consequences.
Owes contributions to works
Works of social nature envisaged in programs such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or having serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although the work programmes have so far advanced, they are at risk because they did not fulfil the State Government with the contributions corresponding to him which include a resource of more than 11 million pesos in all three programmes.
He noted that the total investment in these three programmes is nearly 50 million pesos, of which the State is 25 percent, and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have contributed resources for the works, so the possible delay in the conclusion of these programmes is in force.
“They’re almost 12 million to contribute to them and even though the year is to end haven’t given us a fifth, when they had to give us a part since July,” he explained, “we have started the works and go very advanced, but we need the money.”
He noted that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions corresponding to them, so at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not provide on that occasion.
“It has already passed us in the previous sixty years because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending,” he said.
Despite the commitment of the State authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he noted that the request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, has been made to speed up the actions so that the percentages corresponding to them arrive as soon as possible.
“There are almost 12 million things to contribute to them and even though the year is to end hasn’t given us a fifth.”
Court validates "analog disappearance" in Mexico in 2015
Analog signal replacement by digital is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional disputes that the Senate and the House of Deputies interposed against the presidential decree preceding the so-called "analog package" from 2021 to 2015, not gathering the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón was not exceeded in his attributes by issued the decree detailing the actions to follow to concretize the transition to land digital television.
As a result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was rejected by failing to reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to pronounce on the constitutionality or inconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft judgment, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and law reserve.
In favour of the project only voted Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero itself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to contestate the decree, and by admitting the claims, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions therein arranged for digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to dismiss the demand filed by the House of Deputies, without entering the discussion of the project, also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the President said not to coincide with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure the measures for the public administration to be prepared through general rules.
“I don’t think that if it did it would affect the regulatory body’s autonomy,” he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector corresponds to the federal executive, who has for constitutional terms, the state’s rectory.
Analog signal replacement is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years, and results in better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality, and more channels.
Delaying change would be delaying the benefits of digitalization, which involves a decision of public interest, which has not only a technical dimension, "because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he stressed, “require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic rectory of the State, encompasses a group of attributions that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive.”
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world has already completed the digital transition, and has done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in the issue of the disputed decree, which somehow invades the sphere of competences of the Congress, as in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws issued by the Legislative is being provided, he assured.
Analyze the possibility of counting "vote by vote" in Michoacán
According to the PREP data, the difference between the first and second place of the governor’s election is just 27 percent, yet the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,000 74 total records were not counted.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality in terms of this year's election process in Michoacán, where according to the data drawn up by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the election of governor is just 27 percent, yet the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,000 74 total acts are not counted.
In this regard, Chairman of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), Maria of the Angels Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, almost on 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
As it will be remembered, Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or its Electoral Code of the State or its Electoral Justice Act, whenever the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before completing the legal deadline for them to enter into force in this electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the deadlines set out in the State Official Journal Act.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of the Nation (SCJN) solved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local legislative power and called the state president's vote to constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal", whenever he does not have the right to "repeal or vete them."
Interviewed about the possibility of "voting by vote", Maria of the Llanderal Angels explained that, thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM, partial and total counts of voting by the local electoral body will be possible.
Thus, the partial count of votes, of one or more vote packages, may occur in the assumptions that: the results of the acts do not coincide; there is no record of scrutiny and computing in the case of the box or does not work in the power of the president thereof; or, where there are obvious errors or alterations of the acts.
Furthermore, the total count of the vote received in all boxes of the election may be carried out when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate winner of the election concerned and the candidate who has obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the meeting the express request of the representative of the party and/or to the candidate.
The total count of the vote may also be carried out if the difference between the allegedly winner candidate and the second place is equal to or lower to a percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate remains second, in which the electoral packages that have been partially counted are excluded.
It should be mentioned that in such a situation is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 percent, although not counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total records.
His last will

Felipe Bacio Cortés went very young out of the city of Saltillo to enter the College of Air in Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some didn’t believe it because they said he was even diving in the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio reminds him as a very good person, "only the whole family was in Saltillo we wanted to greet him, as the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagun to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he traveled to Zapopan for his family’s graduation, so he knows his uncle died doing what he liked most in life: driving an aircraft.
Give him the last goodbye
With honors, Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was fired in tribute led by Governor Jorge Torres López, and who gave him the people and government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Zone of Military, where the Mexican Air Force itself was studied, both directors and students of the Tecology.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
Nominated Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put that country on the edge of the economic disaster.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government to face a crisis that has put Italy at the edge of the economic disaster and has put the entire eurozone into danger.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he will present to the president the outcome of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
“The brand is now well-defined,” he added.
Monti has completed the process of building a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy fights a political and financial crisis that has driven the costs of his debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a hard austerity package required by European leaders to regain the hit trust in Italy.
Emphasizing the pressure on Monti to hurry, the market instability placed the yield of Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the press after meeting Monti: “We said we would support this government a lot.”
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to leave this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were significantly driven by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts are intended to have a good outcome,” Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told the press.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that is formating Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti Government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will probably be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in your efforts could lead to a new devastating financial market attack.
The Italian association of foreign banks joined the pressure by warning that a Monti failure would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as youth and women’s organizations on Monday.
It will end its meeting round on Tuesday night.
Monti was named on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief breath at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would dimit, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the eurozone.
Monti said his government should last until the next elections, planned for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before the elections advance.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the major parties insist that he should be made up only of technicians, an indication of his repairs to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish spray is higher than the Ticos
Of Spain’s 22 footballers, ten are over the 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica only one of the 22 convened arrived at the 50 meetings.
A major contrast to Costa Rica, if compared to the 22 convoked by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the San José National Stadium.
While world champions and Europe, number one of FIFA’s monthly rankin, count a broad record of A-class intersections games, the Tricolor only owns the defender Michael Umaña as the only one that has the 50 international games.
This figure reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers playing in the Star League and in powerful clubs in the Premier League of England, maintain intense activity in domestic and league championships, and high-level shocks in European cups such as Champions League.
The above is added to the experience with the Spanish Furia in complicated eliminatories of the European Cup and the World Cup of Football.
Tick footballers, on the contrary, have a limited international spray in an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered to be the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum registration of the Spanish selection is of the archer Íker Casillas, who on Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) matched the registration of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today in front of the Tricolor and impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernandez, a Barcelona cerebral wheel, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other 100-year-olds of the Iberian team, cited Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke's ariet, Raúl González, with 102.
Nearly the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
Follow him Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the edge side, and near Michael Umaña, are the left side Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and artillery Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five overcame the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't come near at 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar owns only one and Olman Vargas and Eder Nelson do not debut yet.
Spain’s historical goalkeeper is David Villa, with 50 targets, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records so many with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its two-decades path celebration tour
“Going to Costa Rica is a dream made reality.”
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam’s bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It’s been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band assures that for them it will also make the dream of playing in the country reality.
Thus said the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is located on the South American wing of its two-decade work tour and Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
On that day they will be presented at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with the Angelina band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extract from the conversation, whose complete transcription is in The Nation on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican followers, it’s a dream that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what their fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream made reality for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and has so far been great.
I've been in Costa Rica only on vacation once; it's such a beautiful country and I think we'll be able to stay there a few days.
So we are excited to bring our music there.
I wonder because there is some sort of devotion to the band, fans live intensely the days before.
What do they say to their most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying alongside us throughout all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to reach Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so much and we regret that it took us so long to reach there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add some pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played over the past 21 years have happened over the last couple of weeks.
We play a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and hope that it has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have a lot of friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we learned, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they have come delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never touched there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is this due to?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs and each likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs play each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire we haven’t played for a while, that keeps us focused and also keep us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we may have been forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting to us and therefore, I think it makes it more interesting to people too.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of path.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they have achieved?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us would imagine that we would be in a big rock band and have done it for more than 20 years ago it seems like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and we are so excited that we can keep making music together.
We all love and love to create music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world we always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of the grunge?
It has always been an honour to be part of that group of big bands.
We are very friends with people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and it’s something unusual.
From time to time, a band arises from a city, but it’s much more strange when five or ten bands leave from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honoured to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were on a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we are lucky to be friends of all of them still and we honored to be part of that Seattle sound that emerged.
It is also very strange that a band like yours remains united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, on its own, is much longer than many bands last.
First, I think we are all lucky to be still alive and second, we all care about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give everyone freedom to experience.
We trust each other with the music of each one and couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure you don’t be too on tour because it’s easy to fall into that game of the great crowds and the people who love your music.
While you remember people are there for music, that reminds you that you must respect the music and what it brought, without being enthusiastic about being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really interests.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was a great thing.
We were a band for almost three years and never published a record until after Andy died.
There was a lot of frustration because it lasted so much and most importantly is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who began in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think about the incredible person Andy was and how I made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and foot and foot.
He was a surprising human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that is why you chose her for opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked most, so we are looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and have to be very entertained.
Why do Yellow Ledbetter always change live?
That’s a question for Eddie Vedder, so I don’t know.
He sings her and I think he does it with the first thing that happens to her.
As a bassist, what are your influences?
They're so many.
Within the first ones I think are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
They're so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge relevant despite being no longer a fashion?
I think we all always feel a little unconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that emerged at the same time, and if there is relevance now, I think it’s something wonderful because it’s music worth listening and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had darker content and now has become more positive.
What is this change due to?
It’s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs though they may sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched me, I cryed when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there’s some trauma in your life and you lose a family or friend, those things begin to influence your art and your music and those two songs, undoubtedly, represent that for me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is internated again for medical exams
Former President Alberto Fujimori was internated in a public hospital on Tuesday to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his head physician said.
72-year-old Fujimori, who holds a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers several illnesses, including a cancer in the language for which he has been operated four times and remains under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told the N TV channel that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of his lower members.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to gain the benefit of indult for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he does not want it because he is known to be innocent.
It was operated four times of cancer in the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 pounds to which other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney calculations, hypertension, and circulatory problems in the legs have been linked to.
Fujimori has been imprisoned in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the Police since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people in the hands of an army annihilation squad that illegally operated in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, led by Uruguay President José Mujica, and integrated by several ministers and entrepreneurs, will initiate a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between both nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican pair, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a wide agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayan resident community in Mexico, according to the agenda broadcast by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "proper for the exchange of information in everything that is political affairs between the two nations," the South American country's presidency published on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France when French president Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on a list of tax paradise, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax paradise, a statement that led to Uruguay’s rejection and the call for consultation with his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has since November chaired the G20, a group of the world’s most powerful emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country, since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has tried to accelerate the concretion of tax exchange agreements in order to leave the “grey list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), comprised of countries that did not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
At the trade level, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (TLC) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The bigotten fountainer passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled, tirelessly, over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but has never done it in three dimensions until now: in Super Mario 3D Land will fight for the girl’s love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month to stores around the world, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without having to wear glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how the glasses without stereoscopy should work," Nintendo's specialized press official in Spain, Omar Álvarez, said during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez indicated that Super Mario 3D Land is “the first Nintendo video game originally designed for that support,” as hits such as “Star Fox 64 3D” or “Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D” were adjustments of existing titles.
Nintendo’s spokesman has argued that, despite being in 3D, “Super Mario 3D Land” is a “accessible” video game that allows you to enjoy a quick and smooth game.
Alvarez has claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "since" to engage less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to turn a "second turn" to the game levels, which this time present more difficulty.
Furthermore, users will be able to choose in real time between an “aggressive D” or one that only affects the depth of action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the different challenges and “not subordinate to optical illusions.”
This three-dimensional Super Mario incursion also represents the character’s return to a portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this Nintendo video game, followers of the saga are crazy and repeat the formula of the success of previous deliveries, consisting of which the mushroom fountainer will have to go through hazardous mining platforms in order to release Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "jugable" Luigi.
Colom suggests the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he gave procedure to the extradition of former ruler Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States for the conspiracy for the washing of $70 million.
Thus the process ends for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to judge him there.
At the press conference, Colom claimed that his decision obeyed the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a court of judgment had already ordered extradition.
He stated that during his mandate he “do not put his hands” in judicial rulings and handled all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Morocco will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Walls, both by drug trafficking.
The done by Colom is an executive procedure after all judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to prosecute the former officer between 2000 and 2004.
According to the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once it has solved its legal situation in Guatemala and its human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was absolved by the default of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process that preceded the extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the fall in the marginality of non-training boys
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation over this quarter of the century.
To this is added the hundred long jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to balance on an act held in the old Fabra i Coats factory complex to which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with dogradation problems or in the situation of falling into marginality.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of officials of entities and institutions who have collaborated with the partnership in these 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Along with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the act attended the former conseller of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the former mayor and current eco-socialist councillor, Ricard Gomà.
They also attended the large Fabra i Coats room, the current conseller of Benestar Social i Família, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of La Caixa’s social work, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current time is also so, but he added that the work done so far is "a good basis".
The president put Trinijove as an example to know how to fight bad circumstances and to give hope to people with difficulties.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Unloaded an occupated farm where macrofiestas were made
The invaders had taken 11 out of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm in the noon of yesterday without providing resistance.
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that lived the neighbors of 51 of Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily abandoned yesterday's afternoon the property they were illegally occupied, and where they organized macrofiestas that desperate the neighborhood, by judicial order and without police intervention.
When the operation ended, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
"From now there will be access control," the administrator said.
The okupas, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - were taken all the electrical facility and part of that of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the stage of the multitude parties, which lasted up to two days and desperate the tenants.
Next to the building there is a disco, Balmes 51, which has also been harmed.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied, the business has dropped by 80%.
The owner of the disco shows that the invaders of the farm made her unfair competition, as they sold the cups at three euros, while in the disco they were worth 10.
In addition, the recreation site owner had had to respond to neighboring noise complaints, while, he pointed out, discomforts not cause the customers of the disco, but the inhabitants of the occupada house and, above all, attendees to the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors.
The club manager explained that the disturbances were so big that even reached an agreement with the property owner and nine months ago that "forgive him" the rental.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that in recent weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors for the situation.
President of the PP’s municipal group in the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week “dislodging the property immediately to end the problems of coexistence and civism that cause neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area.”
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one busy building floor, but over the last few months the okupas had been entering all the building floors and almost all the floors, and that some of them have even been theft.
In this sense, he added, "it is necessary to end impunity and be contundent against the incivism that has been generated in the farm."
Also yesterday, the Mossos unloved a building in Nou Barris.
At 15:30 a.m. police travelled until 35th of Mont-ral Street, after receiving the call from a neighbor who had noticed four people accessing the building.
The four were arrested at the moment.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincide with the opportunity of call beyond disputes on fees
The Municipal Competition on the 16 Doors Reopens Debate on Collserola’s Role in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the peak of the already extinct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed a few promotion pasches from Collserola.
The booklet defined the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park relocated, in the imaginary of many, as the upper border of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented on the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The rating of Collserola as a natural park results in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the jabalisms in the role of the Yogi bear.
In these was until, in September, the municipality summoned a megacompetition composed of 16 contests for so many other gates of access to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of a park, no doubt.
Or that or someone wants to put doors to the field.
The question comes alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The contest, both for its merely organizational and for what it suggests reflection on the city, is the subject of conversation among all Barcelonian architects.
It is almost a recurring topic to be handled when two members of this ancient caste of elects are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact gives foot, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelonian architects, and university teachers, have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Módol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "is necessary" discussing "the mountain front," every time the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
“It can start from the basis that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for their great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," the architect sentences for whom the title of "Collserola gates" encloses a "lexic trap": you don't have to think about them "like access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where you have to act."
Mòdol, such as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as "intellectual rectum" with "some dangers".
Hazards derived from how “uncertain today it is to project public space” after the experience living in the 80s and that it had in the area of the Fòrum “his Swan Singing”.
The first fear is the delimitation of borders over where it can be constructed.
"To limit something is to fix the next step," that is, its overscale.
“We must think of new urban instruments, planning instruments, because the current [referring to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can lead to authentic disasters.”
More based on the question, Mòdol believes that simplifying the Vallesan vertiente of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, not," for a merely topographic issue.
Módol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronat that “should not fall in broken bag,” although he is grateful for the opportunity that the municipality offers its board to intervene in this project “from the first moment.”
And furthermore, he understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the safeconduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a right one," points out) that have been created: "Architects should be just a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the title of this piece is complex, because on the basis of the contest a global vision of Collserola: "16 cross-sea contests have been convened in the direction mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal reading, which see and understand the area as a whole."
This causes, at least in your case, that you have chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can collapse in program and definition with that of the architect of the door next door.
In his view, that is, the council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Dalt Round should, in its entirety, provide a zone of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal and will be free
After 72 days of root, the legal guardian of the Casino Red gave forgiveness to the brother of Mayor of Monterrey of the process that was followed by alleged chantages.
After remaining 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be released after the legal settler of the Red Casino will grant him forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Court, who follows a trial for chantage against the brother of Mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonas allegedly required him to pay an economic fee for the Regional Municipality to allow the illegal operation of the betting house.
Following the public complaint, the State Prosecutor opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the Mayor of Panista and on 2 September was detained and rooted for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agent of the Public Ministry 3 in Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Root 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State capital.
He remained there for 49 days after a second order of root was issued after the Officer of the Public Ministry rejected the crimes of cohesion and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta’s criminal allegedly for blasting a million and a half weights to the owners of the Red Casino; however, he remained only a few hours in the prisoner of median security as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the internal trial in the municipal cell of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, he was turned an order of arrest by the Secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yanez, who said that nearly two months of investigations sufficient evidence was proven to determine Jonah's guilt, such as taking 1.5 million pesos to betting house representatives in exchange for the operation of the house.
On Monday, the legal guardian of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went before the judge José Luis Pecina to request forgiveness for the mayor’s brother, so in the next few hours he could recover his freedom.
During the legal diligence, the Officer of the Public Ministry to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gomez whether the damage had been repaired and who of the betting house partners was the one who gave forgiveness, although the attorney tried to book the name.
Based on the case 197/2011, Jonas Larrazábal is legally forgiven and thereafter no complaint may be filed about the proceedings followed by Jonas Larrazábal, and he will not be required any repair for damage or punishment.
Following the hearing of the legal betting house captain, about 15:50 the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
Secretary of the Court, Jorge Yanez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonas that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be archived.
He will also notify you of the immediate order of freedom issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident where Government Secretary Francisco Blake and seven more people lost his life.
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results cast on the accident where Government Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven more people lived indicate that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before leaving the aircraft, the pilot found that the climate conditions were suitable for flying.
"The elements that appear to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the steps had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the requirements necessary to transport staff.
Furthermore, he said that in the investigations conducted in the impact area the appearance of pieces on the ground is not reported.
“In a search, it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
“The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to transport passengers.
The ground has a seven-degree slope at 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary assured that it is a priority to count on the results as early as possible; however, research can last several months, even reaching one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the Presidential Major State’s helicopter operated at cruise speed and that this happened on a soft ascending ground.
“This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact,” he said.
At the press conference, SCT holder Pérez Jácome recorded six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautic regulativity, the flight was carried out under the visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports at the AICM placed appropriate conditions for departure, as the aircraft advanced towards the border area between the DF and the state of Mexico were shown low-height cloud layers.
Selected routes:
It is likely that by cloud conditions the crew has sought a lower elevation zone and greater visibility towards Cuernavaca valley.
Impact location.
The impact coordinates and the last radar aircraft record coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of remains of the aircraft in a reduced area:
The information available so far allows to assume that the impact occurred in a straight and side path.
The dispersion pattern of the aircraft remains allows to assume that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the sinister still not revealed evidence in the remains of the ship of some kind of explosion or fire.
The latest research results indicate that it may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above the middle sea level, the ground features a slope ranging from the seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predicted to be departing along said path.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After thorough search in a wider area than the accompanied site, around the accident, no dispersed parts of the aircraft have been found, strengthening the assumption that the impact was presented under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity gene
Leads Social Security research to discover the gene of obesity in children and youth; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it leads a research to discover the gene of obesity in children and youth, called the protocol "Childhood and Adolescent Obesity Genetics", which will allow you to count on overweight-associated markers.
In a statement, chief of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the Hospital of Specialties at the 21st Century National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutriologists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, the population is invited to participate, whether or not, to attend the IMSS participating sports units in the Valley of Mexico, where testing for minors is carried out every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He emphasized that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Mexico Poniente State) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Unit (Mexico Oriental State).
Once the goal of gathering 500 or 600 minors is achieved, the study will continue in the Independence Sports Unit (sur the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (northern the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
When World Diabetes Day was held on 14 November, he stated that the goal is to gather three thousand children and young people aged six to 14, with their parents’ consent and supervision, for the application of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about the physical activity and inherited family history of diseases, with the aim of avoiding risk factors that trigger suffering such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that Saturdays are applied to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure taking, determining glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol, and insulin and genetic levels (it is intended to identify genes that are associated with infant obesity).
Cruz López noted that this research is due to the concern of healthcare professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
“The 1999 and 2006 health surveys pointed out that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity, and girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight, a dramatic rise was also observed,” the IMSS specialist said.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on that the country’s population differs from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average Mexican has 65 percent American Indian inheritance, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that overall, obesity genetics result in the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive assessment of children, allowing them to detect whether they have some degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark colored folds (acantosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors deliver it in writing to parents, to whom each of the measurements and lifestyle changes must be made to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic suffering: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remain most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport rather than walking short distances.
It is also due to high caloric intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sugary beverages, carbohydrates (tamals, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics that are analyzed in this protocol.
Asphalt from UNAM would avoid baches
Rafael Herrera, researcher at UNAM’s Faculty of Chemistry, develops polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs sent by the floor were served, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 baches every rain season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a complete chemical faculty researcher in UNAM, who said that if the construction process or maintenance of a floor is possible to reduce the proper amount.
In his conference A technological opinion of the baches, dictated within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory at its office develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and at low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that these types of modified asphalts could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, like some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and thus the formation of baches.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, ones high molecular weight, called asphaltines, and others low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the floor its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius has a nearly solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes broken.
The above means that on the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but is modifying during the day according to the environmental and temperature conditions, the chemical engineering specialist warned.
The FQ researcher noted that Mexico City streets are mostly covered by flexible floor, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphaltic folder, composed of small stones baded in asphalt and then compressed.
Each of the stones that constitutes the folder, he pointed out, is baded with asphalt.
By passing vehicles and generating efforts, it allows forces to spread very well on the floor.
If it was a modified asphalt, it would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphaltic folder, abundantly, a last layer called the rolling folder is placed, which is made of a fine stone material, i.e. a sand that also baths in asphalt.
Because it is about the layer that will be in contact with vehicle tyres, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphaltic folder and provide friction on the way.
Being the part of the floor that will receive and spread the efforts, the rolling folder also requires proper thickness and the material from which it is made should be taken care of.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphaltic folder.
When the ground is moist, water spreads inside the folder and it is difficult to come out, this causes a blasting of all layers of the floor and therefore the formation of baches.
In the process of formating a bache, he said, the first to wear is the bearing film and only then the asphaltic folder is affected, but damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be addressed to the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Research System also explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of baches and therefore the thickness of each of the floor layers should always be related to the vehicle load and ensure that it is met, to prevent baches from formating frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and allow repair of the baches easily and without using high temperatures.
What lacked the Valley candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced Melina Ramírez Serna not to reach the Crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley receives her title number 14 as Princess.
Again the Valley of Cauca remains with the desire of Mrs. Colombia's crown.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with being in the winning podium, looking at the silver crown and the band that accredits her as a new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantico was lifted with the crown and cetro, the department already sums 14 titles of Princesa and Melina (1989), Category of Women Vallecaucans (1989), Category of Women Vallecaucans (1989), Category of Women Vallecaucans (1989),
The big question many asked themselves today is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was chosen Queen of the Police and Best Rostro Jolie de Vogue, titles that obtained queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the Crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor to be considered key in the decision the jury to appoint her First Princess is that she did not convince her answer to the question "What is that book that marked you and why? made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Literary Carriage Leamos.
At the interrogator the Vallecaucana replied:
“I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it’s a way to be culturalized, I definitely think that the book that marked me from childhood is ‘The Little Prince’ is a pretty deep book.
Currently I read "Crime and punishment" is a book of universal literature that we must all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
A response that it didn’t like first by the term “culturalizing” and second by not explaining specifically how each of the books that cited it have marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony, Melina manifested herself to feel calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise goes what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little bit, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the launched hypotheses is said that Valle burned favoritism.
A Bogotan journalist suggested that by being the favorite, the ovationed and the candidate who was wearing all the preliminary awards (the Oster gastronomy award, the audience vote for the best craft suit, and Queen Mother), "that awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't shine on the stage."
And that was noticed in his first presentation in swimsuit on the Hilton beach and his two parades on the crown evening.
Although in both it looked safe, it was noticed that it was lacking the strength and impetus that the representatives of Magdalene and the Atlantic showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the RCN Channel's "Like at Home" program, said that the fact that Melina was named Princess "verifies that the candidate who wins the most awards during the contest doesn't remain as Queen."
In addition, Valle showed himself at the last very disappeared with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For something, two days before the election, international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to their country’s social needs.
“Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we must look beyond physical and focus on their social sensitivity, that before entering the competition, they are already involved in projects,” he said.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for her defects in the back and the fibrosis that was noted in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthiest body, good feeding and responsible physical work.
Queen's preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina didn't have the best body, that was better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very notable, dropped points to him in the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos from the Cromos magazine considers that the Vallecaucan's mistake was the surgical interventions that were performed.
“The surgery is fine, but Valle didn’t know.
His body was never his strength and here it was charged.”
For this award, which for the first time delivered the National Contest of Beauty, after the parade in bathing suit, a cruel vaccinium emerged that was fulfilled last night, because it was said that this was the container that Raymundo granted Melina to not give him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that since today Melina begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international certamens for designation of the National Contest itself.
However, she will pass to the story as one of the queens who despite her step by Cartagena, was escaping her the crown.
This was the work of the hole that identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano.
A Cali lophoscopist went to the story as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4th, a Cali's CTI lofoscopist went to the story as the man who confirmed the identity of the highest chief of the FARC: "Alfonso Cano", through the label of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lofoscopists working in the ICT section, that week was the shift of “availability” to Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in the area of judicial investigation.
When he started his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to enter for more than five days in the jungle to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after performing the corresponding courses, specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. palms of hands and feet.
The week of the Alfonso Cano operation warned Eliazar to wear minimum clothes for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he went out to the Cauca on a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he had to identify two corpses and was suspected that one of them was the man who was heading to the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to carry Guillermo Leon Sáenz's decadactillary card (his true name).
However, when he arrived with the research team to the site where the corpse was, he did not recognize him for his physical appearance, because he was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was without beard, dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the footprints do not lie.
Accompanied by a Galton lupe, ink, a transplant and a lighthouse, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with the card.
His eye didn't fail: he was "Alfonso Cano."
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, who was the top chief of the FARC.
In search of the footprint
For a Sixín de Cali fingertipsman, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González in the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without a margin of error, which can become key in crime resolution.
In addition to identifying bodies, lofoscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of people captured.
When they are captured, many criminals present false signs or have no papers.
We take the fingerprint to them and look for them in the database.
The investigator told him, in a case of theft, touched him to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to take a safety box full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate surfaces to get a fingerprint, but in that case we could get the footprint of the whole hand and identify the criminal, who had participated in different thefts,” he said.
The footprints may also rule out or reaffirm suspects in cases of murder.
Recently they found a dead man with bottles of liquor around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a family member could be suspicious of the crime and, indeed, a footprint in the bottle coincided.
Although this doesn't guarantee that he's been the killer, he's placed him on the crime scene.
A CTI fingertipscopist explained that in objects "the footprints are removed with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a transplant or tape is used to lift them up.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without documents," CTI expert said.
He said it’s not everything as shown in the CSI television show.
Just as not all that shines is gold, not all that touchs becomes footprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective ticket is performed.
“Angeous” challenges authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators clothed in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part of them followed the displacement order and moved to a nearby parish.
The members of the Occupa Wall Street movement challenged New York’s authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter the Manhattan Square where they were displaced in the morning and trying to occupy another park in the Great Apple.
Hundreds of protesters clothed in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access thanks to a judicial order that allows the "indignated" to camp back in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the displacement occupying a park more north of the city, where there have been new detentions.
“Our idea is that if the court doesn’t allow us to camp back on the square, we’re going to set up somewhere else and continue the legal battle for returning to Zuccotti, as well as through seats and peaceful demonstrations,” said one of the spokesmans of the Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the response of the "indignated" to the displacement of his camp personally dictated by Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the place and allowing protesters to stay camped.
Furthermore, the "indignated" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the Holland Tunnel entrance, which joins New York and New Jersey, and owned by the parish of Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police went to stop some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while assured Ephe that he saw several journalists who were also broken.
The organization assures that several hundred people had been installed at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already been displaced in support of the movement members and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square - which is a private-owned area - remains closed in waiting for the celebration of a judicial view scheduled for this same Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning should be analyzed.
Some of the demonstrators displaced up there carried and shared copies of that judicial order at these hours and even delivered it to the officers who kept the square, which caused "some small confrontations," Bray, who denounced that some officers promoted beatings to the demonstrators.
The judicial order prohibits authorities to dislocate members of Wall Street Occupa or apply "laws that were published after the occupation began or prohibits protesters from accessing the park again with shops or other properties they used previously."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, due to that judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and to the protesters, who warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to reinstall with tents and sleeping bags.
The governor personally defended the displacement carried out early in the morning of the Zuccotti Square, an operation in which roughly 200 arrests were carried out and decided because the protesters were "infringing the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming “a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases to harm others,” since “some businesses had received threats” and neighbors feared “for their quality of life.”
“The disappearance of this morning was shameful and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of U.S. workers,” said the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of “lacking respect for freedom of expression.”
The officials of “Occupa Wall Street” also indicated that they plan to organize “big actions” for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that lasted the protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV
Along with Michael Bublé and other Canadian highlights, he will appear in the TV show "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a helper in "Baywatch", a rabbit of "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
The private CTV television channel announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" Michael Bublé and other Canadian highlights, will appear in the TV show "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television show in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution on the internet of a home porn video in which he appears along with her then-husband, the Mötley Crüe battery, Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding a doll that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comic of Indian origin who recently acted as a presentator in part of Charlie Sheen’s “My Violent Torpedo of Truth” tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV’s special Christmas has Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is not strange to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian "fuck" during one of her New York concerts.
Japan renews after earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the fall spiral that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still convalescent by the devastating earthquake that became in a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe the country had suffered since World War II.
The Tokyo Government's first estimates encrypted material losses by $30 billion, a coup that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the GDP data between July and September served to pass page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rate.
The registered in the second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - is also the highest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The recovery is explained, in part, by the recovery of the purchase of machinery to restore the desolate areas by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the decline of 0.9% in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted rises.
However, the true revolting of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of crises to reinforce or reconstruct infrastructure, to serve the deficiencies to grow from zero.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable scaled 1%, pushed by increased spending on vehicles, travels and leisure activities.
The Yen stigma
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refuge values" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro area and the turbulent U.S. forecasts, a privilege that weighs as a blade in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reversal for a country whose economic flotation line is determined by the health of major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, found their weak results between July and September on the Yen quote.
While markets continue to settle the EU’s peripheral countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s Government doesn’t let down the guard.
“We must be aware of the persistent risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand’s floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Economic Policy Secretary of State Motohisa Furukawa.
Indeed, prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most member countries presented more clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the bending points in the world economy highlighted that major powers are being stopped.
Since it dropped four decades to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 August.
The euro zone, even, was located below the average, which is at level 100, by precipiting eight tenths up to 99.13 points.
Athens feeds doubts again
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With peripheral risk premiums fired and uncertainty re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to enter into the labyrinth that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the new transitional government’s “consensus” comes more imposed by Brussels’ demands than by a genuine conviction of political forces begins to be confirmed with facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed in his appointment may be short to apply them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy Party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his requirement for the 19th Februar.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit on 26 October," Papadimos said by opening yesterday a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of trust to the new executive.
A package with 24 programmes to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not clear doubts about his position: “We have committed to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else.”
The conservative leader was a further step in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8 billion Athens urgently need, and made it clear that it will not give its good visa to any commitment letter to compliance with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still scouted by the impact caused by the ordago of the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new government and leaders of major Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible."
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what needed to pay the sixth frame" of 8 billion, although there is no final date either.
The Greek fabric still has a wire for mouse.
Doña Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "preponderant" place in relation to this type of finance
Spain “has reached a worldwide leadership in the role of Microfinance.”
Queen Doña Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor in these last two decades in relation to this intrusion of cooperation, whose "essence" pointed out that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on trust in human beings."
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations at 2015 horizons, and, "particularly, in one that has been set to reduce half the volume of people with lower incoming."
Spain "keep working" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility," said Doña Sofía, which hoped that the initiatives and contributions originating at the Summit, which will prolong until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest, especially for women."
They are “many the achievements achieved” and “many the challenges we face.”
The Microcredit Summit is raised not only as a forum of debate, but also as the platform from which to drive "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that at the end of 2015 it is aspired to be 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of those households will leave the poverty threshold in which they are missing.
The impulse in the conceiving of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated years ago pioneerly" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Doña Sofia as a "act of justice and due recognition".
And it is that she described the father of this tool as an "admiral idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know on the ground her loan policy.
This experience was followed a year later by the First World Summit in Washington and other meetings like those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continued evolution," explained His Majesty, whose link to this project earned him yesterday the qualifying of the "family head" gathered in Valladolid by the "backer of the poors".
Finally, Queen Doña Sofía concluded her intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperial"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity “is an ethical imperative” for every democratic state.
In this regard, he expressed that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to eras of economic goods, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredits are "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" governments in developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not let it be victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of “one of the main lines of development cooperation.”
On the other hand, the Secretary of State of International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauds the "success" of giving "confidence" to people "excluding those whom all close the doors"; and Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the presents to a city that "opens their infected doors of solidarity."
CDU proposes to elect the European President for universal vote
The first day of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU) Congress, on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party.
Initially the future of Europe had not been included in the agenda, but the issue was imposed in autumn, particularly to satisfy the militants who believe that government policy is currently too little strict with the Greeks and could be in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Directorate, was adopted virtually unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and 10 abstentions were registered.
The standing ovation of several minutes that was won, with her interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, unleash any possible doubt.
The key idea of the Chancellor and the motion is summarized in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe is peace, but also because “nine million jobs directly depend on the euro.”
For the Chancellor, “the time has come to open the way in Europe.”
This could be expressed in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to enable strengthening the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the eurozone countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal vote to "give a face to Europe".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly reach an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy also.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have with a crushing majority rejected the proposal to weigh the weight of each country of the European Central Bank's directive based on the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen the weight of Germany.
Anxious to calm the moods within her party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but it is also not that she has tried to win her congress at the expense of the “small” European countries or countries in difficulties willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except past.
Recalling that two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon’s army.
Incidence of fraud in disease deficiencies
Following subsidies, the UMP and the Government undertake an offensive against disease deaths.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a box responsible for family grants and speak on the issue, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and help.
Furthermore, to accompany such offensive, which is part of the willingness to save rigorously, but still reminds of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, most want to focus on illness lows.
First of all, to apply budgetary cuts: the Government plans to impose private sector workers on a fourth day of deficiency before they can take down.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a sick worker would lose four days of wage, that is, at least 15% of his monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
Furthermore, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: imposing officials on a day of deficiency without remuneration in the case of low work (to date, they have no deficiency, compared to the three days applied in the private sector).
While these issues are discussed, the majority again puts on the table the topic of fraud, this time oriented towards abuses of labour lows.
“Controls will be significantly increased and, in addition, if someone is discovered committing a fraud, he will have to refund the amounts,” Xavier Bertrand warned on Sunday, November 13, speaking at the RTL.
Like in other cases, the effects of the announcement appear slightly disproportionate for the reality of fraud in the field of low-labour.
Indeed, this issue has been continuously monitored since 2002 and several political offensives have been launched that have normally resulted.
The French are sick only in the rest of Europe.
Let us look carefully at the national figures first.
According to the French Social Security Institute (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million were paid in 2006 in employment loan benefits.
According to the French Institute of Research and Documentation in Health Economics, lower subsidies accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, up to EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this, 46% correspond to lows by motherhood and labor accidents, while 54% is related to lows by illness, amounting to EUR 6.2 billion.
Therefore, 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 working low days, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
Another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed they had not taken a single day of illness.
Another study, in this case of the Insurance disease, indicates that in 2010 37% of disease declines had a duration of less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
If we compare them to our European neighbors, French workers are no more likely to catch low-sick in other areas.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall labour absence rate (both for health and other reasons) was between 10% and 11% in France, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in disease deficiencies is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a rather limited scope.
The reinforcement of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic controls of illnesses of more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM proved, at 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term lows were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of declines over 45 days, subjected to systematic inspections, 11% of cases were considered to be "duely adapted or unjustified; a total of 1.2 million, as a start, amounts to 132,000.
Therefore, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who took a disease low.
No doubt, an insignificant figure compared to, for example, black work.
According to MEP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent tax revenue losses of between 9 billion and 15 billion euros a year, i.e. more than the total cost of low-subsidies and undoubtedly considerably more than fraud in this last field.
Papademos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to straighten its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos declared on Monday 14 November before Parliament; he added that the 100 days granted to his union Government would not be enough to achieve that goal.
“In order to make efforts to lead to the recovery of the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment program,” said the Government Chief, who spoke his first public speech during the opening of the Parliament’s debate on the vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of decisions taken during the Eurozone Summit on 27 October will be the "major task" of the new government, since the country's remains in the eurozone is "in play," he added.
As a result, Papademos has anticipated that the country’s public deficit will be reduced “up to about 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right reject new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the Rights Group, on Monday showed his support for the measures already approved to try out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of further measures," he said during a meeting with the members of his New Democracy party.
He noted that he was in agreement with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, as well as fighting debris, but against any policy that prevents economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, warning that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the loan of €8 billion required without a written guarantee of all parties' support to the planned measures, Antonio Samaras has responded that his word would be sufficient and that it would not sign anything because of external pressure.
A committee of experts claims that euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live deniing death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In the field of palliative care, the committee claims that governments, health care institutions and doctors work to ensure best palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Canadian society is deniing death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they wish to die and make provisions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report from the Royal Society of Canada, which included six experts from various fields, including ethics, legal and doctor.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in a way that allows assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient is raised such an option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey from the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is tenth, the study points out that “medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid of dealing with the subject of death.”
With or not medication, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And although most Canadians wish to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this sense records Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
As regards the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that do not coincide with the Federal Government's position, which has already stated that they do not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or not constituted a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not caused an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or suicide assisted with non-competent persons or have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in those countries where euthanasia or assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal."
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians, favorable to euthanasia
Let’s remember that 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia, as they think it would allow people whose death is close to relieve their suffering, according to a 2010 survey by Angus Reid.
Furthermore, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not make it clear that the lives of older or disabled people are less valued.
As for people who have practiced assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that a proceedings against them should not be initiated.
In connection with the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, as the authors of the report indicate.
Furthermore, among its recommendations, it suggests that the Criminal Code indicates that the withdrawal of health care, if legally rejected, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The expert committee also calls for healthcare professionals to be trained in the duty of respecting the fact that a patient refuses assistance at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.
In the field of palliative care, the committee claims that governments, health care institutions and doctors work to ensure best palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, in connection with paliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canada's health institutions, the committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, be considered as euthanasia and subjected to the same procedures.
Other experts demonstrate reservations
Other health law experts have already expressed their reservations with regard to the conclusions of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in Law of Health, has described the position of experts signing the report as “extreme”, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to the sick in the terminal phase.
“This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and is over 18 years old can ask for help to suicide,” Deschamps said.
Mr Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seem to prioritize personal autonomy over any other value of society.
He added that “in society there are labels and limitations.”
Health Law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" with respect to the conclusions of the report, which he called "manifesto in favour of euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, puts on trial especially the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President El-Assad to leave power
Damascus denounced a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar El Asad demonstrated yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressure on Bashar El-Asad’s Syria was intensified, which, with Russia’s support, resists it and denounces that there is a “complot” against the country.
Two days after the Arab League’s suspension of Syria, the European Union has strengthened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, have demonstrated in favour of President Assad’s abandonment of power.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader who asked President Bashar El-Asad to "lower power" in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of the regime forces have already died.
“If Bashar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life,” the King of Jordan, Syria’s neighboring country, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomacy chief Ahmet Davutoglu has lamented that the mediation efforts he has been conducting Turkey since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in a failure.
"Whoever is not peaceful in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them, they will leave," he told Syria, a neighboring country with which Turkey is adopting an increasingly harder position.
Following the Arab League and the European Union’s decisions, the United States has concluded that it has “reinforced the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime.”
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly harder tone" with respect to repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces in the Deraa region, southern Syria, have already lost their lives, according to the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other civilians have died "during heavy bombs and shootings in Jobar" in the Homs-seated city, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid Al Mualem considers that the country “moves towards the end of the crisis.”
Furthermore, it has strongly reacted to the Arab League’s decision to suspend the Damascus of its functions, which, in his view, constitutes “a dangerous step.”
"Syria will not weak," he added, ensuring that the plots on Syria will fail.
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League currently study a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also expressed support for the sending of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that he believes is enclosed in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is expected to be held tomorrow in Rabat to bring about the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, which includes, in particular, the withdrawal of armed forces from cities in the hands of the opposition and the release of detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov judged yesterday as “incorrect” the Arab League’s decision, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, although he did not demonstrate support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.

Monti calls for time to markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future chief of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for some time on the markets to form their team and launch a program that will include “sacrifices” aimed at recovering lost credibility during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with the political parties and today met with the trade unions and the employer.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
“Monti has talked about a broad program with numerous sacrifices,” said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the abundant small parliamentary groups who participated in the meetings, after meeting with the appointed President of the Council.
Mr. Gianfranco Fini, President of the House of Deputies, said he hopes Mario Monti will apply for a vote of confidence to Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr. Monti's presentation of a limited list, undoubtedly of a dozen Ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and the obligationists yesterday, asking them for time.
In the "democracy, there are accurate deadlines" to form a government and prepare its programme, he stressed, adding that it is "sure that markets will have patience and will understand it."
Its appointment by the President initially obtained the welcome of the markets, but then was imposed concern, particularly after an unforeseen drop in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should create a team primarily composed of technocrats, even if he has highlighted that he would like to include "politicals".
The new Government will work until 2013, the date of the next legislation, he considers.
According to President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive Parliament's vote of trust before Friday.
Monti has committed himself to working, when he occupies the position, taking into account the urgency and the aim of Italy to "regain its protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn said that “even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not vary.”
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving a budget balance in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted over the past few months, has called for further rigor measures.
Italian “chief of the bosses” Emma Marcegaglia, who will see the mates, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, “as a country that does not grow cannot meet deficit requirements.”
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "teacher" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy," according to editorialists.
The great unknownness will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to place around €20 billion in state obligations before April 2012.
Russian scientist has collaborated with Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in developing a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specialized in atomic risk said Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that UN agency.
The IAEA demonstrated last week its “greasant concern” over a “possible military dimension” of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet nuclear center in Cheliabinsk (Ural) and participated in the manufacturing of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamants" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact the Iran Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Then, it is believed that it cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA mentioned that there are "clairs that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, a Member State has reported to the Agency, he worked for most of his career in that technology in the military program in his country of origin."
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and offences against Muslims have increased by nearly 50% between 2009 and 2010, while the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to FBI statistics on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e., has increased by 49%, compared with a 13% rise in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in crimes against Jews and an overall 14% increase in the number of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of “hate crimes” has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, 47.3% of which are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, the FBI says.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worried that such crimes and crimes have increased again," the Human Rights First human rights defense organization, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is especially significant," the organization added in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long been pointing out that violence against Muslims, as well as all kinds of hate crimes, should be considered a serious human rights violation,” said Paul Legendre.
“The U.S. government can and should strive to end these abuses,” he added, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” in U.S. federal law was inherited from the time of struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter microblogging site on Monday modified the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes their service to look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another so-called "name" allow you to follow more readily and live the activity of other "Tweets", i.e. of those users whose messages ("tweets") remain on the Internet or who follow you.
This allows you to know if you track messages, if you subscribe to new accounts, if you qualify as favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokesman Carolyn Penner told the AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its poor instinctive functioning, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to re-send a message from another person, followfriday to recommend to follow another user), thus opens up a broader audience with a handling more comparable to that of the broad public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users have discussed the interest of this innovation at couple of “tweets” with different views.
“It’s useless, it’s invasive and it’s too much like Facebook,” writes @jemb123.
“The Activity function will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter stream,” writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction to a budgetary "gold rule" in the Constitution
The Government of Great Democratic/Christian Social Coalition that is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a "gold rule" budget to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by the credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when Austrian public debt reaches 74.6%, a much higher than the maximum limit of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly lower than debts from countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency was reduced to a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay more than 3 billion euros in interest every year,” said Christian Democratic Vice-Chancellor for Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responded to a request from the Brussels Summit to the member countries of the eurozone last October: in it, Heads of State and Government requested the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a law with equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian government approaches the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt that type of "rule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease annually by 0.75% of GDP and, starting in 2017, the federal state’s structural public deficit should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities should make balanced budgets.
The goal is to reduce public debt by 2020/2021 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens new exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene the mark of change if the yen continued to rise.
"We'll intervene, as we did last time, if we prove excessive volatility occurs" in the yen exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen reached levels close to the historical peaks that produced the intervention of Japanese authorities on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo sold massively yens for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the U.S. currency.
But the yen has gone back gradually since then, driven by investor purchases who consider it as a “refuge value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar was returned to less than 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to which the last intervention was caused.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was quoted to around 120 yens and the euro to more than 160 yens.
This explosion of the Japanese currency harms the archipelago’s exports, as it emphasizes Made in Japan products and reduces the value of revenue earned abroad by Japanese companies when converting them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to reconstruct" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), said Noda, who fears the growth of the yen cut off the weak recovery.
The third global economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (a 1.5% compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, due to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of yen did not reflect the “economic bases of Japan.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", making it clear that more monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting in late October, the emission institute increased its purchases of Letters of the Treasury by five billion yen (47 billion euros), leading to the 55 billion yen (519 billion euros) the threshold of funds devoted to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
The guys grow, the bags weak
The risk of debt crisis contagion continues to harm European indexes.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the most weakening countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the eurozone, European exchanges are sinking a little more in the negative zone on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 loses 1.4% and stands at 3,064 points.
The Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
“Taking into account the new tensions in relation to the loan yields of the most affected euro area states, stock markets around the world continue to give up part of their recent profits.”
“The investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion,” explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, cited by the Reuters agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a drop of 0.7%, renewing market stakeholders’ concerns regarding Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed eye in Europe and the exchanges will continue to be carried out at a reduced range of variations, so that investors will not have evidence that the situation has stabilized,” Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management, says.
The reappearance of concerns for the future of the eurozone affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency worth $1.3570, a 0.4% drop.
According to the runners, it has lost value after the Chancellor Angela Merkel’s match, the CDU, which gathered Monday in Congress, adopted a motion that in particular provides for the choice that a country in difficulties should leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish types greatly exceed 6%
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at very concerning levels.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of Italian 10-year-old obligations reached 6.85%, while Spanish bonds at the same time offered 6.2%.
These tensions in relation to interest rates in southern countries, although also in France, continue to foster the fears of the stakeholders.
The chief of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which is at risk of getting assumed with the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, on his part, has stated that the implementation of decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "major work" of his Government.
Spain is at the point of view of the markets, while the legislative elections will be held on Sunday.
The difference in rates ("spread") between 10-year obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new historical maximum.
In waiting for growth figures in the eurozone
From a statistical point of view, France has recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a more favorable figure than 0.3% expected, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has decreased the number of the second quarter, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really concerns economists.
Germany has grown by 0.5% in the same period.
The first forecasts for the entire euro area are foreseen at 11 hours, after the European Commission has warned about the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must be more valuable than dogmas.
If there is a topic that cannot be dealt with taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate for an electoral meeting to be the time to reflect on such issues and the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the entire economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, the demographic evolution will result in the duplication of electrical demand by 2050, unless a huge portion of the world’s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the increasing deficiency of fossil resources will have to be reduced to continue producing electricity continuously, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
That is not the case of Belgium, which submits its support to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, nor of Switzerland, which aims to only build state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, by citing some examples, continue with determination with their projects.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of an interrupted plant after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, reality is against such a speech.
The election of Berlin will suggest an increase in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence due to the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions due to the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noticed.
It should be discussed about the case of Denmark.
European champion in the wind sector, from which he gets 30% of his electricity, is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the wind intermittentness; for this reason his CO2 emissions and the price of his electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would lead to a strong rise in the price of electricity, leaving realism to the wonderful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of the French refuse to pay and, in fact, do not demonstrate a principle of opposition to that type of energy, according to the surveys.
Let’s remember that our country’s energy policy has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 director jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it covers a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets that can create non-localized jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would be the sacrifice of much of those SMEs and the loss of 6 billion euros annually in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to work for sixty years when its manufacturer’s collapse is planned?
In order to solve the equation of nuclear energy, we must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no devil source.
Areva’s development of low-CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control of both existing plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, the Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operational conditions; it did not cause any consequences either for people or for the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two unprecedented natural disasters, which led to the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to these progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all electrical actors who want to build a plant study it, the interruption of their construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for Areva and EDF competitors, as it would leave them free way to assume leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogmas and partisan manoeuvres dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the figure policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France’s “human rights country”.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who has jumped on the headlines, with the Minister of Interior (see Libération newspaper of May 23) proclaiming from the past that France "doesn't need foreign talents, workers or counterparts."
However, it is rarely analyzed from the economic point of view.
The question is that there is a lot of consensus between the left and the right on this issue.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the guidance by declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with nearly two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone said Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take care of the entire poverty of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared fear of the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish fountainers.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden for French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity with which they act with regard to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande is limited to include banalities, indicating that the code-development will allow to solve the "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, perhaps is profitable electorally, but economically is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work that summarizes the most recent knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among jobs specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and countries.
The limitation of immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace domestic workers, particularly those under-qualified, by pressing to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that immigrants are in fact rather complementary than replacements for domestic workers and mainly exercise professions in lack of employment sectors.
Poorly qualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not meet staff demand.
A positive effect on wages
Similarly as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country with lack of anesthetics, complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of nationals to have a positive impact on the wages and employment of nationals.
Taking into account the above, Giovanni Peri estimated that an increase of 1% in migration flows represents an increase in long-term real wages from 0.6 to 0.9%.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity contributed by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel prizes and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they contribute an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will make a net contribution of EUR 150,000 to average public budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go to search for the growth points missing him "with his teeth."
These teeth, which dissuaded immigrants, had exactly the reverse effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it is only missing to think about a European democracy.
Democracy is a precious but also fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens more than 2,000 years ago, over the twentieth century has suffered the tragedies of World War, totalitarism, Holocaust, Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the coronels in Greece.
Some perhaps believed that, in order for democracy to definitively triumph over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise vote and as directly as possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little," that it was something thought.
The universal suffrage, although it is a condition necessary for democracy, is not sufficient for itself and can even become a “instrument of oppression,” as the former Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we live in Europe is a economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The pallinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return from the political sphere, but also the concerning feeling of its impossibility, of its incompatibility.
It must be reflected on this ambivalence to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle currently have been displaced and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers no longer advance in the good sense.
We will not win if we require a succession of national referendums, organized based on needs and in a disorderly manner.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a high vacuum of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take effects, but a common, fully-right, quiet and continuous exercise of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The entirety of Europe is the one that follows the orders of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe who suffers humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty recover the timon of the European project.
Because only together Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare their future through investments.
The exit of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, except to lead us to the disaster.
After a long time fighting this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone currently calls for a European economic governance.
That's how it's.
But thinking of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without being lived as such by citizens, would be a new crazy and would lead us to a new dead point.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" Republicans.
The interest-driven revolution would not be enough.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let’s make Europeans.
Cards with "contactless" chip are generalized
The World Chip Card Lounge starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (banking cards, SIM phones, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart’s estimates.
The most powerful segment is that of non-contact technology, which allows you to pay for common transport or purchases simply by approaching the card to a reader.
This year, 460 million non-contact chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Their share should continue to increase in 2012 (foreseen 580 million units) and represent nearly 10% of the global market for chip cards (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been in the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the non-contact payment sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this feature, which is accepted on 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa non-contact cards are being used.
But the large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million MasterCard Pass cards without contact this year.
To put the upper march, however, it is necessary that banks make them available to their customers.
“There are two major French establishments that have been committed to systematically spreading among their customers, bank cards equipped with the non-contact system,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
But it is only a first step towards the future’s payment means: the mobile phone.
Today, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which are essential for transactions.
"They're praying."
“But I should finally experience a real rise next year.”
“We expect that between 80 and 120 million units will be sold worldwide in 2012,” says Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the front.
The Crédit Agricultural Bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a cover that allows non-contact payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale also said yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact via their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, terrorist front is increasing
Paris is concerned about the links between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, on which it was suspected for a long time, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers already "has certainty."
“The way both organizations operate and reports from intelligence services demonstrate that they are cooperating,” he explained, without giving further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation on the abduction of two French in Niger last January would have resumed the gateways.
Rapped at a Niamey restaurant by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the debris of the intervention, French and Nigerian researchers discovered several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of calls made indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers captured especially the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, a cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must certainly wait to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect has been enjoying financial and foreign intellectual support and is increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these “supports” have become increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its operating modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices and of the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressing Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities have long been considering the group as a community of unworthy illuminated.
A Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist magnet Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, “western education is a sin”), urges the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is living a quick success.
It is politized and demands strict respect for the sharia, while its militants are launching in the fight against the wicked central government.
These latter are firstly oriented to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were especially active and attacks on the police stations were multiplied.
Abuya’s reaction was, as usual, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 dead were registered.
Mohammed Yusuf, living arrested, is dead in prison.
Since then, the sect is radicalized and leaving its northern feuds.
Last Christmas claims an attack that causes 80 deaths in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular the protected police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of this type.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would range from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, worrys about all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somali people of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to “share all the information.”
The World According to Republican candidates to the Presidency
In relation to China, Iran and with help to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
An America weakened by the crisis, can manage a complex world with simple ideas or even simplistic?
Listening to Republican candidates for the presidential, voters might think that is.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates make more and more strenuous statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of Republicans.
The slogans, often unfounded, spread over China, Iran, help to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate in the race towards the designation for the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "for manipulation of their currency," a key theme in an America exaggerated by the migration of entire fragments from its sector to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if that involves the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, the former Obama Ambassador in China and the only candidate possessing a sophisticated view of foreign policy, almost drowns with an attitude that "bucks" emotions.
He asked for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who remains stagnated in the depths of the surveys, remains inheartable.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to interrupt its nuclear program.
"If I come out, I'll stop Iran," he said.
“If Obama re-elected, they will have the bomb.”
He also proposed to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing his obligations with respect to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best ranked candidate, shows a shameful unknowledge of such issues.
Recently, he urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing “intended to develop nuclear capacity,” apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had the military atom since 1964.
The Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is ready to deploy the U.S. army in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The recourse to torture against the alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, also advocate Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was an amateur and he had to release the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, the precipitated exit of the Iraq's "boys" and their tergiversations in Libya, and label it of weakness.
But the attacks are not simple to them.
The population rather positively judges Obama’s national security balance, which ended up with Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he distrusts the military interventions that cause a drowning.
And arguing that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more fair.
The Nord Stream, new gateway of Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which directly communicates Western Europe with Russia through the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with a large pump.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the banks of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, at the opening of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline that directly communicates, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolicly, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart from the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have together rotated the steering wheel of the valve controlling Russian gas entry into the Western Europe network.
With this new pipeline, additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will reach Western Europe each year through a first had 1,224 km communicating the St. Petersburg region with the Mecklenburg-Pomerania Land.
A second tube should be concluded in late 2012 that will allow a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas to be supplied, i.e. enough to cover all French consumption.
Furthermore, we already talk about the possibility of building a third tube on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge work presents victory airs.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will enable the supply of gas directly to Germany, avoiding land traffic through third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be harder to influence Russia threatening it to close access to Western Europe’s markets.
At the highlight of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the subject is politically delicate.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has obtained increased supply safety.
But the price is a weakening of energy Europe, since the project has generated a gap between eastern and western Europeans.
Russia has known, in just five years, to triumph its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
“This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that binds us organically,” François Fillon confirmed during the inauguration of the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the large contracts in the gas sector are as political as economical.
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the managers of Gazprom, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of gas arrival.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it from vessel anchors.
It is supported on the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m depth.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mine fields dating back to World War II.
"It was necessary to withdraw or destroy a hundred of them, for caution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to extremize the protection measures of fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs as 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted throughout its length: neither by valves nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Sweden’s waters, but the project officials resigned from it when they saw that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to permanently establish itself in the sea off their coasts.
"In the event of a failure, we'll interrupt gas passage in less than a minute," said Jens Müller.
In the event of leakage, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But constructors consider unlikely a leakage, since they have predicted joints that, according to the forecasts, will have a leakage every 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the gas pipeline is guaranteed by a submarine robot, dragged by a vessel, conducting outer inspections, as well as by a device circulating through the inside of the gas pipeline.
With the shape of a pure, it is introduced into the interior of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The gas pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without any type of repair.
The circulation of the gas is guaranteed simply by pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined their strengths to be able to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of shares.
To her, the Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a common company called Nord Stream, responsible for building and exploiting the gas pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zoug, Switzerland, where the taxation is especially favorable.
Then, Gazprom rented the company, for a period of twenty-five renewable years, all the gas transport capabilities.
“Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is actually transported,” said Jens Müller.
The funding for the construction of the gas pipeline has been made by 30% with shareholders’ contribution and by 70% with bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach €7.4 billion for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom alone takes the risk of expenditure.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sand coast planted with pine pine.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas outlet door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas upon arrival, before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
Total capacity will be three million an hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to return the taste of writing to people.
It has an adventure air, from hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine booklet is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine books with the current appearance were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design notebook, but distinguished, on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant of the company, was responsible for the launch of the new product.
The booklet is inspired by an ancient production technique, soft skin (top skin), which refers to a barned cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the banks.
This type of book was highly appreciated by writers and travellers.
“Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of the avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Modo Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the first years has been left away, in which only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer’s profile, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open spirit and cult.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers at its beginning, now owns about 100 and has two offices since 2008: one in Milan and the other in New York.
Distribute his bookbooks in libraries, from the Fnac to the small shops in the center of the cities, and he has been able to impose his identity.
“We have adapted to times and the need to write, despite the rise of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists expose their own notebook.
In August, he also released a notebook with leopard caps, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: pockets, agendas, pens, computer covers... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that causes envy: in the fall of 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the SG Capital Europe investment fund, currently Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in Moleskine’s history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for jobs.
The 15th Week for the Employment of Disabilities begins today.
Despite a resolved public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among persons with disabilities doubles the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the entire population.
Discouraging?
“No,” says Éric Blanchet, Director-General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabilities.
“The progress made for fifteen years is considerable.
At the time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, there is still a lot to do."
It should be noted that unemployed people continue to face numerous obstacles to access employment.
They usually have an older age: 37% are over 50 years old (average 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not finished the bachelor’s degree, and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for disabled, compared to an average of 38%.
That is, there are numerous issues that particularly difficult the return to the labour world and that "constitute the quid of the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
Furthermore, there are those that are not mentioned; people’s mentality advances, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre for the Cité association pointed out that the directors surveyed have “a level of knowledge about low disability,” with an “overrepresentation of people on wheelchair, physical or intellectual disabled”.
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, a goal that was set on a... 1987 law.
According to the latest available figures, dating from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
"We now reach about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the agency responsible for raising contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The test: the number of establishments "submitted to this contribution", as well as the amounts paid, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has generated high pressure for businesses,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects true awareness, particularly among the big groups.”
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies possessing between 20 and 49 employees have disabled employees in their employment, compared to 82% of companies of between 100 and 199 employees.
Hazard: "A Joy"
Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly match generates them.
We will not dare to say that it was noticed connivity between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, at the stadium of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have actually made peace.
Five months after his fronter’s gesture of angry against Turkey, the Belgian selector has nothing more than praise for him.
“I was very happy for Eden, for his progress and for Belgium.”
"I want to move forward," Lille's frontman answers.
As for the contrast between your presentations in your team and in the selection, "is a set", it has been justified.
“In Lille, I am all year round, which doesn’t apply to Belgium.
"I have to be situated."
Convocated to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this game against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "glant".
We don’t forget about “pleasing.”
He has been encouraging the Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been your fan,” he says.
No doubt, that will especially strengthen the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Johan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami), "remember.
“We have just faced us recently.
“To play against them is always a joy.”
With simplicity, Leekens has referred to the "pride".
"Proud" for playing "a gala game."
"Proud" also for checking, as "neighbor," that France "returns to a very high-level team," nearly a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a great job," he said with enthusiasm.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be happy to be able to share planes with the Bleus towards Brazil in 2014.
"Our small Belgians are growing," he said.
“We’re building something; players are ambitious, hungry.
"They'll be able to see it in the upcoming matches." Included the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Portugal de Paulo Bento faces a great optimism in the back-to-Bosnia match (22:00 p.m.), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the one-to-one match, both teams lacked realism.
“When these 90 minutes go, we will be a happy team and above all a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
It has no doubt; the Selection, which has been leading since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 Euro Cup.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Taking into account the one-way match (0-0), on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the thing is not determined.
Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, yes, but couldn’t score the valuable goal that would have given him tranquility.
“It’s a good outcome, but at the same time it brings a risk because we’ve not marked out of home.”
But at home, at the bright Stadium of the Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before a public that should be equally excited, even if it is clear that the match is "very equal," says an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope the match is very equal, but we are completely convinced that we can take the front," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have 50% chances of participating in the 2012 Euro Cup," said Carlos Queiroz's successor, however, relativised.
Friday’s empact in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get an empath, although they also need to mark.
"It's a good outcome, but at the same time it brings a risk, since we haven't marked out of home," Bento said.
“We are going to play against a team that has a high technical quality and has players with a high individual quality,” he added.
Like in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exercising, from the beginning, a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to “do not give them time to think.”
A good idea, as long as this time it is realistic.
