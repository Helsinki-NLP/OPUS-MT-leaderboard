I am #PRS_ORG# big customer and therefore it’s no problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction that I should apply to the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for €249.
Today it costs €179.
I honestly find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there another option of credit?
In principle, I also think you shouldn’t encourage children to take a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for great siblings to take care of the little ones.
Look for a short time, help for a short time, bring the bottle etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved with.
As long as they can be enough child, I see no problem.
If your K1 is busy alone for a short time and it's OK for him, it's good.
You can determine yourself if this suits your children.
It is not so that he should wrap K2 and accompany for hours while sleeping.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps therefore comes the statement of the psychologist.
Because if something should actually happen like a fire, breakthrough, earthquake, alien invasion, etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to care about K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take, of course, is your discretion ;)
Please help me to find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and although I can still remember almost the entire action, however, I don’t want the title to fall anywhere anymore maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and therapy.
At the beginning of history, an animal caregiver commits suicide by overflowing himself with feed and going to his predating cats.
The case is taken over by a Commissioner, which after a brief investigation of his therapists operates a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The Commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid of fire and lands with this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is commissioned anonymously before each suicide to go and document to the place of self-assassination and to put the photos on the internet.
In any case, it ultimately turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where a chip is transplanted to the patient, which is suppressed a centre of anxiety in the brain and the patients ultimately face their anxiety in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of the window another drives to death intentionally)
This is called the "fight" in the book.
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the gross act I am pretty sure that the book was written in the original by a French author.
If this action is known to someone or even someone could give me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh ever, I didn't have the password for the Wlan.
I just have to contact my husband.
But that can take.
What steps should I take afterwards?
Is it also possible to receive the price difference?
Child, 4 J., Splitter under the Daumennail
Child, four years old, has wood splitters over the entire length underneath the dump edge (outside).
I tried to draw him with a pincet.
Very difficult to catch.
It didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No chance anymore.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining digital decoder and sound module on a circuit board we reach dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost every lock of the track width H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker, including sound capsule.
Like all family members, LokSound5 is a real multi-protocol decoder.
It masters the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 driving stages are as obvious as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders are fully automatically connected to a suitable digital center.
It masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read on the main line with appropriate centers.
For centers who can program only 1-255 CVs exist help registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 driving levels at 255 addresses.
Three other Motorola® addresses allow the trigger of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes it possible to reprogram with the honorable Control Unit 6021.

Because of Omicron: Johnson Will Promote Refresh Vaccination
Always new omicron cases have politics and science in the UK.
By New Year, all adults who qualify in England are expected to receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to progress even faster in the corona refreshment vaccinations in the face of rapidly rising omecron numbers than it is so far.
Each adult in England should have the opportunity to get a booster dose until the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson told his countrymen in a pre-recorded video message on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The UK government will also provide support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the country parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In the face of the Omicron variant, we are facing an emergency, which is why vaccine protection must be urgently strengthened, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third vaccine dose.
"Let's boost now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 other omecron cases were registered in the UK, which increased the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, the increase was 65%. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I am sure that everyone imagines with pronomes.
I sent an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to answer the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a little more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
**I don’t know how to write the email now.
Can anyone help me?
**I am a foreigner and I don’t want to hold officers on my feet either.
Conclusion: Everyone should imagine with pronomes.
I have a total of five books on it.
Four of them go.
Only one that I bought today isn’t going
Obviously, the chair had an unseen deficiency at sale.
How can such a damage occur after 9 months?
Only tryed on the #PRS_ORG#.
But that has been working since about.
14 days no longer.
Therefore, I’ve always bought the last books through the website and then read at the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no longer.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and charge it to me.
[CW] The feeling that I can't help.
Content Warning: I will write somewhat detailed about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something about my soul.
I (21) come more frequently in touch with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that is really nagging and unfortunately too frequent is that many victims cannot help or think we couldn’t help them.
I understand that we can’t do everything and that it’s not perfect.
But in my profession there are fewer things that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in the conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far outside of view and hearing, I can’t all reach.
I don’t know what the reason is, perhaps it’s afraid to leave revenge, afraid to the usual social environment, afraid to remove the children from it.
What I always want to make everyone clear, partly very close to the tears itself, is all worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don’t just have to take violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it will never be easier.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence that is so unbelievably important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series worth of "League of Legends"?

Basketball Bundesliga: Derby Deback of the MHP Giant Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngest Johannes Patrick was confident.
Nothing again: For the second time within not even three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the match, Ludwigsburg’s trainer John Patrick, with the background of the Cup downside in early October at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, said, “We still have some anger in the belly.”
It was not laid after the match, but increased again in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) downside in the Basketball Bundesliga.
More than the naked result disappointed the way of appearance.
As a deputy, a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma was called: The three-quote was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all of young Johannes Patrick) in saying and writing 31 attempts - still questions?
John Patrick said, “We were simply not concentrated enough after the victory at Tenerife and didn’t implement what we’ve trained.”
Something to move the ball.
His opposite responded to Sebastian Gleim: "To win a geile game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," the happy coach said.
“It felt like 10,000 people before.”
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they were at their cost.
Not least, because of BBL-Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and directed the game of his team.
“The best gamemaker I’ve ever trained,” Gleim praised.
While in Patrick’s team, the winners such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed throughout the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15), the giants prevented a total debacle and reached up to eight points after they had already returned 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon came to 12 points.
Fortunately, a lot of time to hate is not left.
Already on Wednesday (19:00 a.m.), the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg, a maximum of 750 viewers.
We had a different email address before, but I changed it.
Yes, I registered a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have legitimately informed ourselves again and wrote them once again.
We originally registered half a year ago.
Steadily packed out of the egg: Max Raabe gets 59
He is able to enthusiast his audience with reinterpretations of slagters from the 20s and 30s.
Currently he is on the road with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he may appear.
In fact, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it's none of it.
The planned concert was moved in May 2022 - "to administrative instruction" to prevent the corona virus.
Also others of his performances planned in the Advent time must first be as it is called on the website of the singer, who becomes 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
As of January, the artists then want to retrieve their dates already placed due to the pandemic in 2020.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the northern Rhine-Westphalian Lünen, Max Raabe has already been a teenager and has loved to sing a lot.
In Berlin, he studied opera song, in 1986, he founded the Palace Orchestra together with companions.
Since then, the baritone has been established in the style of the Comedian Harmonists with its repertoire of charts and chansons.
He has often been awarded awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) - just like his successful album "For Women is not a problem" (2013) - reached the second place in the charts.
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair strictly coated back and considered label, Max Raabe is no longer thinking of the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, dear luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created due to dismissal
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken against the exemption of large housing companies, as was requested in Berlin in a referendum decision.
“With a denial, no new apartment is created, it only changes the owner’s structure,” Geywitz said in an interview with the “Tagesspiegel” (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenant security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private rentals, cooperatives or housing companies is, by the way, the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the SPD, Greenen and Left Party coalition wants to set up a commission of experts on how to deal with the result of the referendum decision.
However, if the situation did not relax, Geywitz did not stop discussions with the FDP in the Ampel Coalition on further exhaustions in the lease law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake by 2029, limiting increases in tense housing markets and expanding the rental level.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market nevertheless does not relax, “we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps,” the SPD police officer emphasized.

At least 100 killed by tornados in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornados have been drawn through the United States.
Alone in Kentucky, more than 100 deaths could be complained.
The pictures from there reminds of a war area.
On Saturday night, several tornados in the United States have destroyed severely and possibly demanded up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave an approximately 320 kilometres long snow of destruction, especially in the Kentucky member state.
His Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, everywhere the Tornado was crushed, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just go away.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
Only in the Kentucky member state, he accounts for up to 100 deaths, the official numbers rise every hour.
Hello, I just saw that she's sold out Vitrine #NAME#.

If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, only can I order the ceiling now and deliver to Germany that is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an artike or given a return through the contact form and wanted to ask whether it was arrived or processed because I haven’t yet received a statement.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising claims
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees for the vaccination money premiums.
This means that they are on a line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Economics, which today demanded financial incentive for vaccination.
The redesign of advertising logans to vaccination – according to German model – is also intended to increase the willingness to corona vaccinations.

Help in First Own Campaign
Boron to Grusse!
I’m just leading the adventure for a group of 4 friends and want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign written for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made, written the wicked and their motivations, designed the individual acts, and now I am trying to write the entry adventures and stole over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a carriage with grains from Gratenfels into a small village near the Thuran Lake.
There the further action is to develop.
A few miles away from the village is intended to draw up a group of Goblins to the heroes and take them into a backdrop.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in different ways: convince, action, threats that recognize the danger early, whatever players are in mind.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with arches and saws
In the case of unremarks, the Goblins rise up the heroes in a hollow path and flanking each three left and right arches arms the carriage, while two with spears stop the carriage.
If it comes to the fight and the heroes are subject to, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all discovered unconsciously and then healed by the son of the village scholar, a semi-half.
The carriage, of course, is gone.
If a defeat is inevitable, this half of his servants will enter the hero in struggle for help.
The cart is still there, everything great.
What do you think of Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the encounter as the beginning of adventure too much?
The Goblins group will still play a crucial role later, so it’s not only canon feed.
EDIT: Wow, I had not expected so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narratives.
I built the lamp again.
And again put together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I would like to send them back.
If you then get the return tickets, then I can pack the lamp and bring to the #PRS_ORG#.

I'm notified by Sky Sport F1
Hello, dear F1 fans, quality on German Sky has decreased more and more throughout the season, so I want to make myself a little air with this post.
First today, in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was discontinued to let the F1 pre-report start on time.
Although the delayed start and start accident of the schedule was far behind the planning, you could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
It seems however that for legal reasons, the F1 has priority and therefore has to restrict everything else, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Nonetheless, stupid, especially because Sky UK has transferred the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a little praise: commentator Olivier Zwartyees has well accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then there was once again unregulatory knowledge in the F1 with commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both didn’t know that you can switch the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation was already in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the decision that verstaps can switch tyres when there were corresponding radio claims on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there is this possibility for verstaps.
I think such elementary rules should simply be known when you comment on the F1 at a pay TV broadcast.
It is also not the first puzzle rate, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.
Generally, it doesn’t like Roos’s artificial commentary style, but let me say that the taste is a matter.
But I really even like Heiko water from RTL better.
This includes constant noises that simply make both look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee at the reporter Peter Hardenacke or “UuuuHD” by Ralf Schumacher.
Just the latter brings a lot of trouble in the comment that he doesn’t seem to take it seriously.
Lastly, the advertising simply takes over on Sky, in the exit round, Sky is the only broadcast that goes into the advertising, how to listen to F1TV because only the German soundtrack must go out without a comment immediately after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two broadcasters make less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as a free TV broadcaster.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not let me look away from the disadvantages.
The remaining program of Sky Sport F1 is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcast that transfers the F1.
Unironicly, RTL is making a better job in the four races they are allowed to transfer.
So, in any case, the grandiose F1 season makes it much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable broadcast.
I would ever be interested in your opinion.
#PRS_ORG# pendulum lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that should be delivered last week and that is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short period of time (the fabric has a hole on the front of the chair).
I ask for support.
Ventilator pumps are excellent to supply an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Check in the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services compared to.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate the entire systems.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable so you can connect more outflowers.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model fan pump are also offered to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air cloak (finding us in the shop) or with a decoration that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasury, mushroom or something similar.
The MK series has a special, soundproof design and thus provides low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to an outstreamer or otherwise by means of an air hose 4/6 mm and it can start.
The ventilator pump should be the same or higher as the water levels and be mounted outside.
If the ventilator pump sits deeper than the water level, a back valve should be placed between it.
Easily cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent if once water runs backwards, the water runs out of the basin through the pump...
If the ventilator pump is mounted outdoors, you, like other air pumps, should be covered and protected from moisture
The MK series pumps are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we specify the 3 day processing time here in ebay, the packages are packaged daily and the packages are also collected daily here.
Everything goes well on the way, it goes very quickly.
We just want to prevent a little bit so that nobody will be devoted, just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding of the whole employee who also work in the shipment sector... of course there is no corona stop.
Please do not rate badly just because the delivery is delayed, which is due exclusively to the package services.
Of course, you like to cheat about these services, even if we say at the moment...they have it damn heavy
This is also very different regionally.
Do not be bad to anyone, stay healthy and we all hope there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without arms?
Can you order your legs in bright here too?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator to space
The daughter of the first American in the All, a TV moderator and four other passengers have taken a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the missile system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
Launch and landing of the approximately 10 minutes flight took place in the west of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under the bright blue sky, Bezos took highly personally the freshly cut astronauts after their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue room suit when he opened the luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members, and Blue Origin staff, the six passengers gradually climbed out of the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching a height of 107 kilometers.
74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of 1961 as NASA astronaut flew to the All Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after which Blue Origin's missile system is named, and 50-year-old television moderator Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets:
As much as they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin didn’t report.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminded her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard at his stakes and do everything himself.
It was just like that, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also excited.
He would like to return to all again, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flights up to 100 kilometers
The missile system "New Shepard" is largely automated.
The capsule separated from the missile during the flight reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the Earth, temporarily with severitylessness, before the reusable object re-breaking from large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts view 100 kilometers above Earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third all-manned trip of Blue Origin: The first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old U.S. pilot and an 18-year-old Dutch.
The second in October was the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics argue Bezos and Blue Origin to promote the business with space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the good of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I currently study biochemistry in the first semester and really find the subject rather exciting and also in the laboratory doesn’t disturb me (have already been the inorganic chemistry practice behind me).
Of course, I also informed myself before studying on professional prospects, but I also thought at the time I decided to study and go until the doctorate.
But I doubt at the moment, especially the prospects of the profession.
On the one hand (studycheck etc) you hear super opportunities and the profession is totally sought, on the other hand you hear of unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
Therefore, I would really be interested in:
1) What are you working right now?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/pay?
3) What have you studied/which education have you done?
4) Would you do all the time again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am really uncertain at the moment and I may think about terminating the study in 2022 and making a training as a technical informatician.
If you have experiences, it also likes to write :)
Extra Stress Before Holiday & Holiday Weekends
This topic came to me last week.
But I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why only now a post.
Not only before great holidays, like Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our operation.
As it seems, there are also those before holidays plus bridge days.
Indeed, it was like this: last week was Marie Heavenlift, which is called "Auffahrt" with us in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and companies make a bridge day that is semi-official.
There was a long 4-day weekend in the house last week.
So what's gone last week?
Everywhere stress.
Lauter emails, which must have to go out before the trip, order here orders there, everything *unrelated* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "next week then" sounds after so much time and that shouldn't be?
Or because everyone wants to afford as much in a shortened week as in a normal week?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday but I was also powerfully nervous.
What is this self-injury about holidays?
Why do we have holidays if we don’t have it right?!
The stress didn’t come from the top, the colleagues were all so independent.
My question is simple: are we just the Swiss?
Is this our reform-evangelic kind?
Or do you know that in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld looks forward to Christmas in Thüringen
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home - but has no gifts yet.
“The beautiful thing, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian forest,” said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the feast by baking and basting with her son.
"I love it," said Catterfeld.
But until the senseful days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time I have no gifts yet, I have to finally start now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth running of the mouses and the renewal of the fever.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny fever.
The majority of poultry damages occurring in bird conditions are due exclusively to nutritional errors.
Since the fever consists of oil-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is prerequisite for the formation of a fine spring dress.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses occurring during the mouse are based on lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the disadvantaged ratio of amino acids in most plant feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the use of NEKTON-Bio, no further vitamin supplement should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water-soluble and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately, it still doesn’t work
DDR-Handwork Model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, which was used in Slesia and Middle Germany, the very rare Lok probably comes from the proposal of the model railway ME Heft 11/1968, was used for playable tracks and defects, see also photos, function, the series E 95 is a heavy track of good goods.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Hall (Saale) and we operatively work up
In 1924, the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned the AEG to submit suggestions for an electrical locomotive that should be able to transport on this track 2,200 tons of coal and 530 tons of person trains at 45 km/h travel speed.
As a maximum speed, 65 km/h were required.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with tat bearing drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens cutter plants with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the delivery of six locomotives received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives entered the Soviet Union as a repair good.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Dessau Reichsbahnhof, the processing value of all six locomotives was found.
[4] When the progressive reelectrification of the Middle German network revealed an increasing demand for locomotives for the heavy goods train service, in 1959 the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were worked up, the remaining machines served as spare part donors.
In this case, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 present in larger numbers were first preferably constructed.
Only when it was not to be seen at E 94 that the number of work could not be increased further, the E 95 went to the focus of work.
[4] First, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway operations plant.
They arrived at the railway station Halle P in 1960.
They were usually used before coal trains from the Hospital Valley towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt in their own circle plan.
Problematicly, the complicated control of the locomotives was shown with an increasing age.
Thus, it often occurred that gunman remained glued in switching operations.
Then the Beimann on this locomotive had to resolve the shooter during the ride with hammer and wood rod.
Damage to the motors occurred more often and led to months-long failures in the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of the electrical operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn could refrain from old locomotives and most splitters, so that the E 95 was released.
In addition, they found that the German Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electrolocomotives only on a single basis, which had resulted in a problem in train operation due to the difficulties with the machines and the viewing relations of the driver status.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were terminated in the middle of 1969, they followed the E 95 01, which resigned the service on 5 October 1970.
The new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
Until the E 95 02, all locomotives were split down.
The E 95 02 was placed as a replacement for the future museum locomotives E 77 10 as a soft heating plant at the main railway station Halle.
It took some time for the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was worth maintaining as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external elaboration of the locomotives began with the aim of presenting them to a vehicle view at the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it belonged to the Dresden Traffic Museum as an inoperable museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed.
At the DB Museum Hall (Saale) the locomotive museum is managed.
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P traditional community work on the operational elaboration of the locomotives.
In April 2015, the locomotives were presented for the first time at an exhibition at Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new inner and outer painting, with the transformators checked and five driving engines operating.
-The locomotives were used until 1945 on the Slesian mountain railway and the branching sideways, where they were proven due to their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were renamed to Leipzig to the Middle German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia.
Handwork model H0 in OVP, function good, it is necessary optical rework on the lock in self-work, dubbed, with game tracks, smell of cellar !!!, very rare handwork model, very small edition- perhaps the set comes also from the small-sized company ZCHUTCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging can have labels and storage traces.
The F parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle beam is held by two feet.. unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, unfortunately, these are defectively produced.
The middle beam does not fit into the planned holder.
So I get sent new.
When will they be released?
Not flat.
These are, according to the assembly guide the right of the shape, they were only too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing they fulfill their purpose
With me they are not flat
Could I get them sent?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem again?
Home fire with two light injured and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in a residential house in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro area was caused, police said Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landberg am Lech).
According to the report, two inhabitants were brought to hospital on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The exact fire cause was initially unknown, but the police did not go out of intentional burning.
Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck took the further investigation.
But it comes a lot later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
Fake News - Biontech-CEO published Vaccine Photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech chief Uğur Şahin had not yet stated publicly about his vaccine status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend moved him to it, Shahin said.
CEO and co-founder of the Mainzer company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing how he gets a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was false information on social media that I supposedly was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of Biontech Pfizer vaccine,” Shahin wrote on Friday in a post on the LinkedIn network.
“For a few months, friends urge me to post a photo of myself on which I’m vaccinated to counter this false rumor.”
So far he refused this because communication shouldn’t turn around himself.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened when I heard that an old school friend is currently fighting for his life.
He fights a heavy COVID-19 disease and hangs on a breathing device for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Shahin wrote.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be anxiety, which is often driven by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with the German Wave is circulating in which Uğur Şahin says he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the German Wave itself cleared.
“I’m not legally allowed to get the vaccine itself at the moment,” Sahin said at the time.
There is a priority in Germany in vaccinating vacuum.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been removed for a long time - and the Biontech chief has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in the conversion system: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light was exhausted on Friday night: no electricity anymore and in many cases therefore probably no heating.
A fire had broken a removal station.
After a fire with severe damage in a remote station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Vig-Center in Northern Rhine-Westphalia have to exit without electricity for about 24 hours.
Due to the fire on Friday night at 41,000 affected inhabitants in several municipalities, the lights were exhausted.
The western supplier reported that Saturday numerous emergency power aggregates were in operation until the large-scale disorder could finally be completely fixed late night.
Firemen and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The supplier thanked the people concerned for their patience and the helpers for their use.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the circle, the firefighters and the THW for the tireless use,” Primary Engineering Head Florian Witt said in a statement on Saturday night.
The repair of the damage will still take a few days, as western network monitors were able to initially only provisionally re-operate some lines, he said.
A technical defect led to the fire after company information.
Electricity flows again
The fire exhausted on Friday at 19.15 a.m. has severely damaged parts of the 10.000-volt slot system, according to western network.
There are necessary comprehensive cleaning and repair work.
Parallel to this, a connection was created to a 30,000-volt voltage level.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply remains.
Since Saturday 18am over 21,000 people have had electricity in Much and Ruppichteroth again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid have been gradually activated from 21:30 a.m.
Since 23.15 a.m., the last ones of the failure have also had electricity.
More than 80 mounts of western networks and partner companies have been in use.
The authorities had also called for neighborhood assistance on Saturday after the establishment of an emergency power supply for important buildings.
"It is important now that citizens take care of older or alone people in their neighborhood and communicate with local fire equipment houses when needed assistance," said Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
In the installation and operation of emergency power supplies, the inhabitants of Altenheimen were focused above all.
Furthermore, according to authorities, temporary care places have been established in schools for those who could not provide themselves or who need current-dependent medical devices or are dependent on medical care.
Good morning!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them with you and pay them in euros?
It is the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy <0xE2><0x99><0xA1>
But I cannot mount the bottom on the table.
It's custom #NAME#.
There are three versions of this.
We wanted those with table boards diameter of #NUMBER#
we have 155cm diameter.
My #PRS_ORG# came today, but I can’t shift it into each other and therefore shorten it.
Can you continue to help me there?
Otherwise I would have to send them back, because otherwise they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy with a feedback
Yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do that!
Do you send me the return license by mail?
The repair is now completed.
I had tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, I did not restart the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost embarrassed.
We do not agree with this
Northern combination: Combiner Riiber wins
The German Northern Combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid are printed at the Podest at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepâe.
The duo had to be hit once again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started into the trail with a huge advantage after skiing.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both re-made and use version 4.5...
Maybe you have heard of problems more often.
I had my #PRS_ORG#, a book purchased it seems to be on it too.
Sobal I want to open the message comes, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be incorrect to sign up to customer service.
As far as I can recognize it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in between, too!
In order to make the colour order uniform and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water from dust, fat and fingerprints, rinse and dry with clear water.
Before you first bring the brush to the model with a new colour, it is recommended to exercise 2 to 3 strips.
You can do this on the later not visible inner side of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first strip on the component
Drag the brush uniformly next to the strip.
Slight overlap of the colour layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid wiping quickly with the brush.
This creates irrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden range.
Start with the bright colors.
Otherwise, the dark ones might pass through later.
Metal tones and metallic colours come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unbeatable metal sliding can occur when they mix with normal colours.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you install them.
Original reliable appearance reach the models through the decals or drawing images.
From landmarks on aircraft to ship names to adornment bars and marks on car models: The decals give the model the last slide.
Put the decals in the right order as long as the components are still well reached.
An aircraft cockpit can be adhered or easier before it is mounted into the scarf.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, pincets and toothstools are when sticking time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut out every decal you need and put it to you.
Decals are also called water sliding images because you moisturize their back shortly with water until the carrier paper becomes dark through the wetness.
Then pull the picture only a small piece of the paper and place the piece to the corresponding spot on the model (which you also humidized before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper away on the side.
Caution: Always check whether the picture is sitting correctly before you pull it completely from the paper so that it doesn’t glue, crack or even rip.
Suck excess water with a domestic towel.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book shortly, as soon as I look for something else, then I don’t read the book anymore and I have to unsubscribe and sign up and reload the book and look for me where I have read.
On Saturday I have already communicated with you.
Do I get this by email?
Also for all three packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 single packages.
Okay, thank you very much!
I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
Will I get that back without any problem?
Child Request Treatment at PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello together,
we have been in childhood treatment for some time, now when it comes to the billing with the PKV, it suddenly comes up.
The series according to:
We had applied for the child's wishes in advance at the PKV and received the commitment of 3 attempts.
The attempts were not restricted in any way (e.g. time framework, success, etc.).
The first attempt directly led to successful pregnancy and birth and was charged with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and conducted 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but they didn’t expect the PKV yet.
We applied once again for the PKV’s costs and we received 3 further trials.
After some further trials (we have carried out more trials than promised, logically the most expensive of the PKV) we entered the bills at the PKV and received the evil surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3), the PKV wants to refund only 3 trials.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise expire.
The second child’s request is a new insurance case.
According to terms and conditions, however, “the insurance case begins with healing, it ends when treatment needs no longer exists.”
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here to refund the PKV (only 3 attempts) or we (are 5 attempts)?
* Should the PKV have to point out in the promises that with a birth the further attempts fall?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (related to closed hair) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give your opinion here.
Thank you for your help!
Please send me the three variants by email and tell me how to get them back
All right.
We will not order anything with them anymore.
If you add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (equal address), you obviously have lost a good customer.
You are happy to send this to your manager.
This is not competitive.
The colleague told me yesterday that the refund was launched, and now tell me that I'll have to send the thing back.
I probably can’t do anything for the commode to get completely disturbed with me.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
There is clear and clear that the repayment has been caused and I still haven’t received any repayment with #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair has to sustain normal use.
Otherwise, they cannot sell it as a office chair.
Regardless of this, the guarantee of 24 months applies.
No, I cannot get another kind of packaging.
I will be able to remove the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
Advertisements are added to these products with in addition to purchased hooks, but we cannot find them with you.
Can you help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What is exactly a low-budget movie, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has to say the following:
A low-budget movie or low-budget movie is a movie movie shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the web you can find plenty of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What's wrong with it?
And what maybe you don't like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, I have already set up 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
I wanted to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is it now reliable as well?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait for 30min is not chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...then I will quit soon because it just doesn’t work here.
Hello.
"Halber victory" against Belarus associated with high costs for the EU
In conflict with the Belarus regime, the EU can announce a "half victory" by politician Raphael Bossong.
The costs, however, are very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong said to the Evangelical Press Service.
The EU has not resolved the confrontation sustainablely, said the researcher at the Berlin Stiftung Science and Policy (SWP).
This condition - Belarus doesn't contribute very small, but the EU feels a winner - probably goes on for a while.
Dealing with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
Obviously there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not resolve to do so, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development at the same time weakens the cohesion in the Union.
"It seems that it cannot persecute if a Member State is in mind to do its thing," as currently in Poland, which doesn't even allow the EU Border Protection Agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU will pay another prize for its policy at the border with Belarus, said Bossong: A principle agreement on asylum policy will be difficult because the line "Border Protection, Border Protection, Border Protection" has been strengthened.
Renewed attempt to cross the border
According to Polish border protection, migrants have once again tried to reach the territory of Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and returned to the border, a spokesman told the Authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials were advised by migrants with stones in the event near the place of Czeremsza.
According to the report, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be provided medically by a military physician.
In total, border protection 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border lock.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU has thrown Alexander Lukashenko as a ruler in Minsk to have anchored her with the prospect of entry to the EU.
According to reports, Poland and Lithuania are border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees to the country.
Moreover, EU Commissioners traveled to people’s home countries to stop leaving there.
The most effective element of the EU reaction is the pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
“The EU has thrown its market power into the wagshale and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.”
Minsk must also take into account internal policy costs.
The Belarus society is probably unconceived that the security apparatus regularly slides thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finals
Max Verstappen is supposed to have committed two rule breaks during the race, according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - According to the controversial Formula 1 final of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has objected.
The silver piles suspect two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase when he is supposed to have overcome unregularly.
A second objection was made against the rating at the end of the race.
According to the Mercedes view, the protocol was not followed in compliance with the regulation.
Verstappen had still overcome Lewis Hamilton in the last round in Mercedes and was on his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre was carried out shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutch had overcome cars riding in front of it.
I'll check that.
I'm talking to the bank and reporting to you again
Thank you for support

Judith Hermann reads from her novel "Home"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann was sold out in the Blue Note on Friday from her current novel "Home" and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nightly sounds at her door.
I gave up the contact form for returning an item yesterday, but did not receive email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my inquiry was entered.
It doesn't have everyone the time for their clogged chat and incorrectly supplied cheapware from China.
Your mistakes you fix and not all of our household.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We had shaded yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# received an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a re-order of the Night table and a return label.
This e-mail has not been found yet.
The package is still going to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.

But sorry only because he says he is not anti-Semit that means nothing.
It’s like an afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Your i will not admit both.
But Collegah constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic embassies.
If you want to distance, you should simply leave it completely.
Yes, wow, then you're just as little serious as Collegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution is simply completely lost.
For me, a god has brought the whole thing to start.
But as soon as you are creative, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just insane.
And so you're a science enemy and don't take any more seriousness like Collegah

Lups are often labeled with enlargement data.
However, these information apply only to exactly defined conditions that rarely meet the terms of use.
In order to optimize your lupe, please keep in mind the instructions in the table "Technical Data" (see user manuals in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices - also in the case of insertion lups - light reflexes are created.
These mirrors are significantly reduced by an antireflective coating.
If you comply with the optimal conditions of use - lupe closely in front of the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less perceptible.
Further information can be found in the appended instruction (existent in German and English).

Tanners in Schönwolde: Women in the municipality of Krembz are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced so many curious situations in the sale of tanks.
Once a man should even have returned home without his partner because both couldn’t agree.
Every year, it plants well 2,000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has experienced so many curious situations.
This is always a bit funny for the nighttime, he says.
What about the voucher??
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat that is grilled on a rotating spindle.
And therefore both have their name.
In German, an equivalent would perhaps be something like the "Dreher", which far sounds not so delicious.
Problems with Glass Fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have a new fiberglass connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I have trouble building a stable Wifi network now.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit to a few failures.
The new fiberglass connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox.
However, the other DLan module, which sends the wifi, no longer comes to the full 500, but the more I remove myself in the house with the module, the less it comes to (so uses a plug, which is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This causes the Internet with the new fiber connection is now even slower in the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set that appears to use a new technology.
Although this was slightly better than the Dlan, there were similarly large losses.
Could someone explain me why with glass fiber so much Internet speed goes "lost" through the power line?
Is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely complicated to still move in the house LAN cables.
I am really desperate, so I created an extra account here.
That is why I would be more excited about an answer.
When is the time to change the giro account
Who would have thought that it would be the first time of rest in the rotational accounts seems deceived.
While many banks have used the autumn to make tricks of their customers confirm the charge increases in the past again, the free amounts for negative interest rates also continue to decline.
For example, the Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a boundary of 100,000 euros for a long time.
Now she has just halved the free amount once and has even quarted for daily money.
In a first step, the border was reduced only for customers of the Group-Sparte Postbank - to 50,000 euros on giro and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for daily money accounts.
However, these lower amounts apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed upon request.
And not only for new agreements, but also for "new individual agreements with inventory customers".
The Commerzbank had already fallen down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as did ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, just popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the amounts in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks have a free amount of 25,000 euros or less, according to numbers of the Verivox Internet portal.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached €25,000, but there is still a legal discussion with the consumer centers, who in the first instance have even gained the right against this regulation before the Land Court of Berlin.
Now the banks are already discussed whether the institutions may have to make reserves - in the event that the upper instances also explain negative interest rates in principle are inadmissible and have to be paid back to millions of bank customers.
The table board was delivered for 8 people instead of that for 6 people.
The underground is that for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their lives are like a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected the most influential wife of the year by the U.S. magazine The Hollywood Reporter.
For them, who made 2021 with the "Friends" re-redesign and the continuation of their "The Morning Show" series, this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
About her appearance takes care of a whole army of assistants, stylists and coaches.
After all, as Aniston says, they get a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a single chip from the bag).
To fly to her the hearts of the female and male fans nevertheless equally is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just got bad with luck - and still looking for great love.
And he removed the baby's request from the list.
She was always asked when she was now a mother.
It hurt her.
People who asked this have no idea what is going on to me personally, medically why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Remain hopeful that success and glory will also be happy.
Unworthy End of a Career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 went still stiller than he thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finne pulled out his gloves and wiped his sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a light band touch, Raikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi after not even half the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" finished his career in the motorsport kings class.
His wife Minttu and the two children traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's biggest success was the winning of the 2007 World Cup in Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and came to the podium 103 times.
Friedrich takes 60th World Cup Victory - Nolte wins in the Zweierbob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
“I’ve got it once that I had to win nine and a half a season, then I could create it until Cortina in 2026,” said the double Olympic winner of the BSC Oberbearburg, who made two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he stopped Johannes Lochner’s attack by five hundredths, in which he rode from rank three to one.
Then he changed a bit in the material setting and led a bigger advance on Sunday at 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he sat in front of the British Brad Hall.
Third became the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
“We’ve gone greater risk today and have been rewarded,” said Friedrich, who also introduced his 22nd victory in series.
Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who traveled for Stuttgart, came to rank two this time.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in ranking four in the first race on eighth.
“If I knew what he does differently, then I would do it like that,” said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
With the women, Laura Nolte took the third season victory in the two-bob on her home railway.
On Sunday, after the fourth place in Monobob, she ran on the triple success of Germany with Deborah Levi to win World Cup.
Two-bob Olympic winner Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia came with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen, ranked second.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she booked the first podest square this winter.
Kim Kalicki landed on the third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first podest place in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama takes me with.
I am super-cool with the development.
There’s still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay,” Burghardt said, emphasizing, “it’s not just pushing but there’s also a lot to do.”
Jamanka was a little angry about the not completely error-free rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I had the ceiling already in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What do I do?
I haven’t received it, so I can’t redeem it, so I have finally asked it.
Through Corona, last year I had completely different problems and never had time to do so.
And now he said he expired, which is very angry about me.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare seat bank.
I want to return it and then order it again because it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipping started on 16.3?
There was nothing like this long delivery time on your website
No until I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
Your colleague has been removed yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the wrong delivered.
But we want the shelf module yet, just a new un damaged.
And not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello love great girls and girls and women,
I have a lot of things I just want to write and maybe it's the one - or others like that...
I am 24 years old, have kPTBS, full-time student, and dog mom - even except that my dog doesn't scream or go to the kindergarten he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (from 6J together) is sick, a 2nd grade burning has come on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we've got a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him to shower (because hand is in the association wg burning).
It is cooled above and we are currently seeing ourselves less (1-2 weeks) which makes me very much to create with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child has just stomach pain, I've cooked for him and now he's in his cushioning ceiling and relaxed a little after I was there with the heat lamp and strikes for him.
I live alone with my sister and mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now there is still homework to us, which we are naturally dividing.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me.
My PTBS disease is just quite well set, I'm half-way well therapy and I'm going to get well.
Not good, but I'm almost symptom-free.
My university just demands a lot (for me), tomorrow at 5pm I have made a written test for which I have still made and overmorning anatomy hours for which I should prepare at least a little bit.
And next week I will have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what will then be in my calendar and not in my mind because there is no room anymore.
So my week is going so: Just over tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But then the whole goes on?
Just until birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holiday.
Only until weekends.
Just until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I’m just so stressed that I need these spiritual points because otherwise I’ll pack that.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but otherwise I can't do that...
Are you like that too?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don’t have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I cannot believe that in words.
I don’t know if I would have survived my KPTBs.
I think that's also partly a lot to do with women's mental load and that's why I thought I'm sure to find suffering women here...
I absolutely wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost successful!
I got my order today unfortunately is the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has print.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer to me?
If we exchange the table now, will I get another colour or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
The other two times.
But she was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I found at the time at school that many religion teachers do not believe in God, and it is just another subject such as math or earth exploration for them.
This was always a bit strange for me, perhaps because I was raised Christianly and I always believed.
What are you doing?
Perhaps you can also tell about workers and students with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and occupational and it is meaningful to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But if it’s just strange to have a physicist teacher who doesn’t believe in relativity theory.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don’t believe it?
Maintaining culture or anything?
Hope your question is not too private.
Can’t change it or not?Write it in English I also understand well
It's been a long time, then I'd get away from it
All right, thank you.
I expect a feedback until early next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please search for movie help
Hello, dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (bin 24).
I think it was a movie for young people.
In the film there are two times (or parallel worlds).
The modern (real world).
The past (or the Empire of the Dead) (not completely certain).
Because I can’t describe it in detail in the real world there’s a young woman.
And in the Empire of the Dead a young soldier (uniform similar to the soldiers of the Caribbean curse).
For some reason, the paths are crossed and there is an act.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this kingdom to live himself.
The transition is also the tomb of the soldier.
Ultimately, I believe both soldiers fight against each other.
If you say something, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little girl slept from week 1 only on the stomach.
Almost forward: lives still :D
Relax.
Such a child holds a lot more out than you think.
Make sure that everything is right, don't get in and watch sometimes, but don't watch minutes of monitoring.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Axso and ours had no sleeping bag, but always had a ceiling.
Watch your child when he sleeps.
Does it turn the head to the side?
Can it rise from the belly from something?
Or is it directly in the mattress with the face?
You can find out if everything is okay.
We were all grown up, and when my husband was born, it was a walk and would be that you put the kids on your stomach to sleep.
In addition, we have already been "stam customer" with you and have already bought very many items
But why do you only offer me 20 euros?
Hello, I have already written about you with a colleague yesterday and no feedback yet.
It's about my wardrobe that has arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHUNUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit into the cabinet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not currently used.
To say it clearly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is just so that the politics of this broadcaster are now under all the grass.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a large betting tour at the same time.
It was said that you are an “independent” Internet broadcast.
Arno: You wanted to be “no running column.”
What are you now?
A 0815 advertising station that tries to bring his BilloMerch to the Elitefan.
And then we have Marahs Do's & Don's.
Of course, they apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
They can, of course, continue to offense people.
A Krogmann who is completely missing empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded rooms attempts to make ashes.
How to find all this well?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I ask for Rueck call because my supplied wooden table was defectively delivered.
Body break due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a consoler of abdominal pain or simply for cushioning, my little heat friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Cherry core pillows are a traditional home medicine for beneficial heat applications, as cherry core can absorb heat very well and deliver dosed back.
The removable interior cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft reference makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel secured even if they don’t do so well.
The cherry core pillow with reference is suitable as a heat-supplier only for the following areas of application:
Check before heating the pillow to untypical smell, stock or fire spots and immediately remove if there is.
Please take the inner cushion out of the reference before heating!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (Please note the microwave manufacturer's details!)
Directly after heating, shake the heat uniformly in the pillow!
Then put the inner cushion back in the reference.
In the first heating, light moisture can occur on the surface, but disappears in repeated applications.
Be sure to keep up with the indicated warming instructions, as longer times or higher energy performance can cause damage (inflammation and combustion risk!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner pillow has been referenced back, please check the temperature of the pillow to fit for babies (max. 43 °C) on your armchair!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverous diseases, circulatory disturbances, fresh hematomas, blood nuts and open wounds, as well as in people with decreased pain feelings.
In case of existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumor diseases, as well as pregnancy, please contact a doctor prior to use.
If seams have opened and loose cores come out, remove the product and loose cores immediately and inaccessible for children.
If the product is used to babies under 1 year, the temperature of the child should be regularly checked during use to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents occurring in connection with the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The reference is removable and washable at 30°C in the machine.
Please note the care icons on the product!
Darmstadt to Hinserie Zweiter - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 is allowed to dream of the return to the football club.
In the meantime, Hannover 96 works out of the table cellar.
Ingolstadt is not under the third trainer.
Joy in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over the interim Christoph Dabrowski and frust in Ingolstadt after the misfortunate stand under the new Coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my power supply.
I bought it again about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought power supply alone is enough to operate.
False indication, the battery is empty and the laptop is no longer starting despite the inserted power supply.
Then I have developed the battery, but there is nothing doing here either.
Do you have ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in the network operation?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don’t know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 backpack from Peak Design no problem!
20 liters of capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems that can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold parts.
And whatever you need for everyday items remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical access to the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is still presented in a new look.
The elegant, minimalistic design has literally in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some very innovative solutions that reliablely protect the interior of the backpack and still provide access to the photo equipment in a second.
This works with two options: once conventionally over the cover valve, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, a greatly thoughtful solution for effective protection, which has already proven to be at the Messenger Bags.
In the closure valve there is a closure hook made of metal with suitable anchor beams on the front side of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill stands" in this case: there are 4 anchor beams, stablely lined into which the closure hook can be engaged.
If the backpack is fully charged, you just take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper.
Flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be reliably closed without cracking the hook.
The second option also distinguishes the everyday backpack fundamentally from others, photo backpacks: besides the lid valve there is still a zip opening on both sides of the backpack.
It eliminates the greatest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to wall through the content!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the daily fitness of the backpack: if you not only take your photo equipment, but also your daily items or travel luggage.
In the Everyday backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more below) and thus easily store both separately from each other - and access it independently through the two side openings.
In addition, you can draw the backpack from the right side to the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the main chamber, while everyday things remain safely in the left backpack half and do not come between them.
Comfortable, easy adjustable wear belts help in this.
And since the outer cover of the backpack is also completely made of 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the content remains dry even if it is intended to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I wait in vain for the email from your support.
#NAME# gave me yesterday an email from confirmation for the
Contact on the part of the shipment announced to pick up the wrongly delivered table.
So far I have not received any message.
I ask for immediate settlement.
I’m already writing with the third support staff, with no one I got further than the promise that I receive an email as a confirmation.
It is the return of the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#
Should it not be seen when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him in this way is no option for me...
It works.
Thank you for help.
We wish you a nice evening
Hello, my order is #NUMBER#. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher to me, I will immediately place a bigger order, but after all I kept the damaged furniture and did not send it back.
And that last year, unlike the thought, I couldn’t realize and I couldn’t resolve and clarify it right away.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept it.
Roting brake discs are designed for the dynamic driver’s claims, which can be appreciated for reliability and safety in braking even in difficult conditions.
Roting brake discs are made from casting and then mechanically processed (driven and cut).
All tuned discs are manufactured in short series according to individual technical properties, which are suitable for specific discs and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program will be created, which is aimed at evacuating the disc according to the properties of the original assembly.
The tuned discs manufactured in this way ensure high comfort and brake efficiency.
Furthermore, created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake slots.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned discs underscore the character of each car through an attractive and outstanding appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In winter 1848, a man discovered brilliant brokens in the water on the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" from '49.
Thousands came from Near and Far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities of the country.
Areas were locked down, tents were set up, and salons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted his share of the wealth of the country.
For many, it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name.
You're going to look for gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and build businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seemed to have the same idea!
You have to exceed your pioneer colleagues to not go with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
Simultaneously, you choose your actions, have to maintain home with your resources and build a tableau that is more and more "working" for you (called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, obtain additional actions or turn rules to your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual game style with fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year when gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year when California gained official state).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly select a location on the game schedule where they can perform actions.
Then their selection will be discovered and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it will get a lock!
This disables half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then players carry out alternative actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting tents, browsing rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning revolver heroes.
Once all actions are completed, the pioneers will return.
At the beginning of each round, the awarder turns to a new location and changes the available actions.
This continues until the awarder has moved five times, that is, every location has covered once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which players have to defend Coloma from an assault of angry bandits.
If the players have taxed enough revolver heroes and the bandits are numerically higher, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end at the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final evaluation takes place.
The player with most victory points wins!
For free shipment, I take the mode of shipment up to 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm, goods shipment (games enrolled).
Most of the others, DPD is insured and tracked with sending (games foldered, wrapped with flies and packaging paper).
If you are a collector then I can also send carton in carton for an additional fee of 2 euros, which does not come to 100% pressure points.
"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentation appeared today in my Twitter timeline, and I looked at it right away.
Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a guest in talk shows and holds lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Are Being Tyranns" (2008) he launched a violent educational debate.
Former patient: in and educational rights now charge severe accusations against him.
Please be careful, the movie is hard to endure.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsible persons must never, never, never! to go power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is meaningful and possible in the situation.
Brrr, she still shakes me.
Holetchek: Countries advise on the removal of the test obligation for three times vaccinated
At their next meeting, the Country’s Health Ministers want to decide on a triple-vaccination exemption of the test obligation.
“We countries need quickly clarity whether and from when to when the test obligation can be triggered,” said Klaus Holetschek, Chairman of the Health Ministers’ Conference, the Bild am Sonntag.
The removal of 2G plus for three times vaccinated is "not only medically useful, but also provides an additional vaccine incentive," said Holetschek.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) pledged that he will make a proposal to the Ministers of Health conference on Tuesday.
So I want to send the lamp back
How do I get the best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me on?
I can no longer handle purchases via my #PRS_ORG#.
Advertisement: Ups, an error occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page goes on the computer.
I have updated account data.
Why can this be?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, i.e. sense perceptions under full anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 to 1000.
Most often it comes to hearing noises/voices, rarely seeing pictures, and most rarely seeing pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesar sections are surgeries that are accompanied by an increased rate of awareness, as you avoid very deep anesthesia to protect the child until you are abnabelled.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia interview.
Certain anesthesia methods such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are accompanied with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love everyone, although this comment I describe Awareness correctly, however, u/Nitemarex ** per definition had none.
I read her comment incorrectly.
The chair is defective.
The 20 euros don’t help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also a standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if at least you take the defective chair back.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I've already sent you an email that you didn't answer.
Again the question.
In the order and on the bill, the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The shipper is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me that they only deliver to the door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don’t know anyone who can wear the heavy furniture on the first floor.
I'm not calling me?
I had a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died 97 years old
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an inspector.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre story.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, print fresh: "An old man gets older."
The tremendous diarrhoe of a slow farewell to the world led by theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.

There are several types of pallets.
One of the most common are European pallets, standardized wood pallets, which are mainly used in the European space as carrier.
You are certified by the European Pallets Association EPAL
According to statistics, in 2020 Austria has produced over 10 million pallets in Austria.
The production value was 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported annually to Austria are not collected

Upload Tips & Tricks
I had a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect gulash.
That was Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
Thank you again for it :)
Now I came to the taste and I want to cook roulette for the first time at New Year’s.
Tomorrow I will set up a cattle fund for it.
Do you have any tips for me otherwise?
Note: I have no oven, but just a big pot.
How's it going on now?
What about the books or how do I get them back to my #PRS_ORG#?
Although my English is no longer so good, I get it
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was informed by email on 18.01. that the refund was made.
So far, the money hasn’t received me.
Please check it.
Where there are still Christmas breads in the room Lübeck
For many people, gain or ant belongs to the Christmas days such as the tanne tree and the gifts.
Didn't you have poultry yet?
Now the time gets short.
We'll tell you where you get a Christmas bread in the room of Lübeck.
The "Drive" of a tube-end level significantly contributes to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME regulator, you can adjust the desired level and the cracking content of your sounds on the one hand.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL regulator that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything on the "gain" and distortion.
Furthermore, it sounded already that you can even float a power reserve with the POWER LEVEL regulator if it comes loudly.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL regulators, you can use the full potential of the VT+ series in any situation.
The headphone can also be used as a line output.
Indeed, the signal that is attached here is processed with a box simulation so that you get an eminent "acoustic" sound print even when you use a headphone or directly shot.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX box, so you can jack to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate voice device.
Anyone who also gives a VFS5 foot keyboard can also conveniently call the sounds by foot, switch the effect blocks on/off, and the pace of the compatible effects "touch".
This is really essential for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX takes another step in the future!
But I saw it like that with others.
Is there a possibility for you to send the lamp back?
Because it hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you continue to help me?
What about the commode?
Will we get an update again for the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, you've been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it doesn’t, I’d be satisfied with a discount or voucher too.
I may find a customer for the furniture.
Only over a thousand euros for goods that I don’t need are a lot.
I just received my delivery and would like to know whether screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to assemble the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) to the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worthwhile.
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
In the negotiations on the revival of the international nuclear agreement, Iran says progress.
“Both sides are just before agreeing on the issues to be on the agenda,” Iran’s chief dealer Ali Bagheri said Sunday at the Irna News Agency.
This is a "positive and important development" because at first it has not even dominated agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement will prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the renewal of the agreement were continued after just one week’s interruption.
The negotiations are taking part in negotiations between Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France and Russia.
An U.S. delegation is also involved in the negotiations in Vienna, but only indirectly.
Thuringia overcomes Saxony - Free State now federal country with the highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in the nation.
As the only federal country, the value is above the trademark of 1000.
As the only federal country, Thuringia has been located above the 1,000 brand on Sunday’s Corona incidence.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which last showed the highest incidence across the country, this value was 990.5.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia was slightly decreased, but was also above the value of 1,000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 heavy-duty COVID-19 patients were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, reporting delays may occur.
In addition, health offices have been overloaded for weeks and hardly followed with the recording of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it and stick to the package and send it at the post, was it?
Do I have nothing to click/especify/fill here?
That’s what I want to avoid, that’s why I write to you.
I would like to take the return on my own cost.
8 euros return fee is a frequency in my eyes.
It's time to change
###MBundday are greeted to me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What about the post here?
If you’re looking at the activity in the past months of the MBundday, you can find one thing: it’s not extreme.
We came to a winter star and expanded the summer hole to a few months.
#Where's the problem?
Yeah, what was it placed on?
For the most part, it might be simply related to dissatisfaction, how some things have been expired here and how we are generally present.
In the last few days, the impression has been increasingly shown that many here really have Bock on the MBundday.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundag is asked who wants to keep it alive.
The boost came from u/edizVEVO, who has been aware of this project in the last few days and has found one, simply in the words, sherbenhoupen.
After some writing, several people from the community have found themselves who are looking forward to rebuilding the project.
However, once again I would like to expressly call upon everyone to participate, but only in this way this project can exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server where we can exchange each other, as well as develop concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Targets:
* How will the MB-Day work in the future?
* What existing orders need to be modified / removed?
* How should we come outside in the future?
* How to recruit new members?
* How do we create a fair election system?
I’m pretty sure I’ve forgotten a lot of things, but that’s not bad, we’ve finally got the discord.
If you have lust and time, come to the discord, work with and let us democratically decide on the future.
I ordered a lamp screen from you that it is still delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/known for it and is not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered another suspension from you for this.
I put it together and noticed this then when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also pretty sad because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the daily cover #PRS_ORG#, is it also in oversized size, i.e. in 240/240, for example?
#PRS_ORG# needs to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up soon.
And I ask you to arrange it now.
I don’t have a suitable packaging, but will remove the cabinet as far as possible for the collection - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by phone to agree on a collection date.
Is there a guide for the assembly?
How long would I have time to get this or choose to send it back?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She's lived vegetarian for a while, but she's rarely eating meat.
I was a vegetarian for a few years before.
On the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without a lot of thinking.
And I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support the animal good, but at some point I reflected and understood that I would ultimately support animal torture.
That is why I decided to become vegan.
At the moment, I had the impression that the misfortune came on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and meant she knows where her flesh comes from and reduced as a vegetarian animal lies.
Now I wonder if my answer to “plump” was?
How do you answer the question?
I felt like you’re quickly put into a corner as a vegan and conflicts come without you’re going to put it on it.
He welcomes a loving vegan woman.
It is not a clear exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# do not disconnect from the legal requirements to remote sales.
I’m on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# doesn’t get my returns on site.
Because I cannot be on site because of a funeral, unfortunately, this cannot be changed either.
Please assign me an alternative collection date.
As of 01.02.#NUMBER#, I’m constantly meeting again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: €45,000 subsidy from the country
Recently, Rheinland-Pfalzian Interior Minister Roger Lewentz, at the Lahnstein City Hall, submitted an award decision of EUR 45,000 for the new equipment car Water Rescue of the Volunteer Fire Defence Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle in use since November 2020 amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in safety.
I am happy that the country Rheinland-Pfalz supports us here,” says Lahnstein’s mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment car is used by the diver steak Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rheinland-Pfalz.
Over and under water, they perform tasks in water and ice relief as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, we are continuously expected to increase stakes: the boom of hotel shipping on Rhein and Mosel and the further increased use of the Lahn as a leisure flow contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read about 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations, however, synchronized, removed and the app reloaded NOTHING worked.
I’ve been a bit freezed because the entire action has cost me a lot of time and I’m hoping for help now.
Okay, then it's so.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

Thank you for the first time that you put the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in the State Service in a similar activity, that is, we were also weapons carriers in the executive, I wouldn't like to take on it further!
The question of the right and the left is always very simplified.
In principle, however, one should say that, of course, the state servant comes rather from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
That, of course, in the special uniform and weapons carriers should also be clear that these people, of course, can deal hard with the lived reality, of course is also clear, because you have a living in your average white ones, but I cannot leave a lot of Germans with migrant background, women, and even homosexual ones (and I don't meand these exces feminine).
But even though my experience first sounds strange as a conservative attitude, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel less accumulated by excessive left-wing politics, even though these politics supposedly have to make it right for them, they simply want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the rights, since, of course, police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but they can openly say their opinion there or even openly forge any state-threatening plans is medially entirely overwhelmed and upset me as well.
Of course, it happens that just just police and soldiers who were often starting to pausalize because of negative experiences and sometimes things say that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that sometimes righteous people meet that are running a rainful exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, this is my opinion that it is well struggled and also with political education and enlightenment is counteracted to the whole!
Germany is so internationally constrained and that’s so good that we couldn’t afford to have right racists and Nazis in our rows at all!
Yeah, what I do not understand, the other basket I also ordered on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered it was not sold out.
I ordered in November.
It was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It is still about my order that is no longer available.
I've been shading with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wooden part there are two deep curves filled with anything yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More ordinary by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been working on a thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (independently, very little free time), but I have been getting more poor for my life than rather to conduct my household permanently clean and properly.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it packs me and I clean up and clean up.
But it’s never really “that someone could ever come spontaneously to visit.”
My husband is (unfortunately) not better either, although it bothers me somewhere, but usually loses household just against work and unlust.
The kitchen is still regularly cleaned because we like to cook.
Now on my question, have you managed to become more ordinary with your child?
We don’t have anything to work on it yet and this question has dealt with me for a long time.
Because for myself I don’t have any incentive, it just doesn’t bother me as doll as long as no visit comes and, for example, there’s always fresh clothes and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger stimulus with your child or stay slim?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically pre-shaped cut, offers maximum comfort, perfect fit and allows almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preforming with special, further impression on the joints for improved freedom of movement (on arm and knee bends)
The Focea Comfort 4 has more than doubled the surface covered by the Flex System to further increase the comfort at the Flex System 2.
Seamless stretch panels on the joints reduce friction (axels, arm and knee bends)
High-quality preforms in the bottom of the back and in the step ensure a staggering, perfect seat.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch panel in the lendwind range increases flexibility around the back zip and thus improves comfort, especially when moving and mounting and mounting the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone, which is located around the shoulders and on the back, guarantees increased flexibility in the movement of the arms and the back.
Fireskin is a warming, water-resistant material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
Located on the chest, it brings heat into a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal on the face on the hood increases comfort, seal and durability (separate headhood)
Soft zone in the collar improves the sealing with a finely adjustable width adjustment through a flexible, soft slide closure that does not lie to the cashing or to the seams
Double handles with zip on arm and foot joints connect an overlapable inner handle with a soft, cashed neoprene outer handle
45° Incorporation at the end of the inner handle for increased elasticity and loadability when dressing.
Long zip on the neck with an elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without a hood
Long G-Lock P back zip (overall without hood) with metal slider and built-in water dam system for improved sealing (beuchat patent)
Zippers on arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zippers to prevent ripping if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels are glued with external and inner overlap
Edges of the outer handle cushioned for greater loadability
Coated edges of the inner handles for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system has been designed to fix the computer at its place, especially for deeper dive walks (the system is compatible with all common bracelet computers)
Career in social work - as someone with self-insured personality disorder?
I have been training in software development and have been learned for about a year.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly aware that this profession is not the right one for me, why I have been thinking about starting again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have an self-insecure (i.e. anxiously avoiding) personality disorder (EVPS).
That means that I have no self-esteem and I am therefore ashamed.
I have no problem with talking to people at a real level, but it’s hard for me to carry out lower conversations and I’ve been told more often that I’m uncomfortable (while I think that has already become better).
Can I become so social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in the open youth meeting, but rather in addiction advice or family aid, for example.
But I don’t know whether the concrete day-to-day work is really the way I imagine it, and it’s hard to find something on the internet.
The EVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotional), because every time there is something on my code to be complained ("the simplest things is cacked again") and I feel hard to ask more experienced colleagues for help.
I will probably have the problems in every profession, but I wanted to have mentioned it instead.
Did you get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I wait for an appointment for collection
What you mean, please return!
If I uploaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message comes to your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Are there problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the feed, the bird breaks into the individual protein components (amino acids) in its gastrointestinal tract and, in turn, builds its own body proteins, which it also needs for the creation of fever.
The nestling poultry and the poultry renewal of poultry poultry are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high stress for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON bio cannot be administered during breeding, otherwise there may be disorders in the gross run.
Following this curvy use of NEKTON-Bio, it should be resumed to daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin supplement) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral substance supplement).

1 g NEKTON bio to 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft feed.
It is recommended to prepare just as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
A cut measuring spoon (inland) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON bio.
In case of severe fever damage, the double or three-dose NEKTON bio can be given at the beginning until the approach to fever renewal is visible.
Then the normal dose is supplied until the renewal of the poultry is completed fully.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25° C.
Please apologize, but the chair is sold as a office chair.
How can an office chair break down after 9 months?
The guarantee claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to tell you that my order has been damaged and images have been attached.
Have you received this email?
Statement of a community employee in repeating the statutes
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
On our property, a nozzle tree is to be tasted.
Therefore, it was a petition to the community.
An employee writes to me that the cases of fruit trees and therefore the nose is not part of the statutes.
In the statutes, however, the nose is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received any message
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think, only the question is, yes, if I can pay in euros and give me the ceiling to Germany
Can you check it?

Oh, okay, understand.
Well, thank you again that it was so easy!
Advice and ideas on further occupational life
Happy Christmas to you for the first time!
My Christmas is moderately good because my beloved head just breaks down everything you can think about.
Before I get out here now, I need advice and best of people who somehow know my situation – that is, of you.
I'm just making the ref as a cross-inbox.
Originally, I studied something else and worked there in an area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I call nothing more precise here).
The whole thing was too boring and I looked at alternatives that could make me more fun.
Sometime I landed at the teaching office and I was sure that it is - even if the framework conditions are significantly more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I arrived at the third "Google other job tenders".
And it's only half a year around.
In the paintings before I have always decided to continue and at least end the ref, then I can still swing.
But right now I'm absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I’ve been completely laid out.
Now there are vacations, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there was my weekend also my weekend and my weekend my weekend.
I was free there.
And the stress at work was no matter at the moment.
Now myself the family party is too much stress.
And then there are these rigid structures that further nerve me.
Basically, it’s fun and from the outside, the ref also runs good, regarding the feedback and so on.
But I’m completely moved out and wondering how much stress my body keeps before it makes it completely dense - if it doesn’t just do that.
I wonder if I would like to have the rest of the work life like this -- just when I read some posts from you here -- or if I shouldn't go back to the old area, where I was worthwhile, I could take time free when I needed it, and the job somehow boring, but was properly paid for that and together in a team that I've worked as a single case is not the time now.
But then I wonder if I didn’t reach the same place again in a year as I am now and dissatisfied.
You notice it's all somehow wrong, but maybe you've got outside advice or ideas like I come out of this situation that I'm completely finished and almost starting to cry at the smallest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy Christmas, it’s enough for me for the first.
Thank you for reading and apologize to the wine subton from me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has continued to develop, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly reflects the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we present a brand-new modeling engine that is absolutely up-to-date in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology), based on the analysis of components and amp switches, the VTX amplifiers await with an authenticity which is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this intelligent circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only sprout so.
With VOX’s “Tone Room” software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sounds as you’ve ever imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since to meet newly added sound requirements, which Ano 2010 has led to a power boost of the VOX Valvetronix series – with more dynamic and more numerous and decisively improved amplifiers models.
From handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists are looking for a maximum sound variety.
All guitarists dream of the printing and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced play of game dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt speech.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers have discovered that the end stage primarily determined the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology using this findings.
The 12AX7 tube-equipped valve reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier makes the behavior, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier perfectly.
NBA: Despite 20 Wagner Points: Magic Loses at Clippers
The defeat series of the Orlando Magic in the NBA stops.
The Wagner brothers can shine, but it’s not enough to win the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counters of his older brother Moritz, Magic lost on Saturday 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main room is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable slide closure parts, it is designed according to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all size arrangements to full-format mirror reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible equipment would be a DSLR camera with a secured lens, two to three alternating lenses, and a plug-in flash.
Bigger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for its equipment and for photo-free things.
Even drone pilots make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano outbreak in La Palma: probably longer in history
In the nearly three months since the beginning of the outbreak, the lava streams on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in view?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcano outbreak on La Palma has been the longest in the well-known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
The outbreak of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, with 84 days, was considered to be the longest in the Atlantic Coast in front of the West Coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
Although the activity of the still nameless volcano at the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, vulcanologists dared no further prediction when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable,” said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Damage in millions
In the nearly three months since the beginning of the outbreak, the more than 1000 degrees of hot lava has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other buildings, according to RTVE.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick laundry layer.
This matches almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Along the coast, two new landscapes were produced by cold lava with a size of approximately 50 hectares together.
Heavily affected was especially the immensely important banana cultivation for the island, of which approximately half of the 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and already in the crisis before the volcano outbreak.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas were severely impaired, the newspaper wrote "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas stands in front of the door and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have been associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the striking tension.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still keep our increasingly divided society together.
More importantly, it is to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a peace-building "society contract of natural peoples", which can be rigid routine and refilled in the context of this tradition.
How Nicolaus became the child of Christ
Strongly taken it was the Protestants through which the Christmas days were closely linked to the gift.
Earlier, gifts were delivered in one or another way on the Nicolaus Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that St. Nicholas as Bishop of Myra had thrown three women in a night secretly in their windows to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional kind of gifting, the popular custom in Germany emerged to fill the boots especially with gifts of children.
Protestants confronted this custom because they rejected intermediaries between God and humans as "holy worship".
For these reasons, they retain themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made from Nikolaus the Christian child and therefore founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of gifting was disappeared on the Sabbath evening.
Since most Protestants no longer see such detail questions, it is only the least angry that the custom of Saint Nicholas is similar to the Martin's use of Martinssingen and Martin's switching still an integral part of the pre-nighttime.
Today you can find in boots at the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to sought-after luxury watches everything the heart wants.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources demonstrate a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicolas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving was disappeared on Sabbath evening.
However, in all Christian-shaped countries there is a joyful cuddle muddle on the question of who now brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on whether the child appears on the Holy Night or the Santa, who is in principle a kind of Nicolaus, to which some characteristics were assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white noise bar, which has little common with the rather strict Assyrian bar of the historic figure, his slide, which is taken from pensions, and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Holy Nikolaus remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the Witch Befana, which should have instructed them the way to the child of Jesus.
In Scandinavia, fable beings sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia, the fathers brought Frost to some glory.
Here are not renies, but three horses that draw their slides as a troika.
In Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussitan Wars, the child is responsible for the delivery of the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the Royal Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police said callers had reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a weapon and the business of a bookmaker.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that could be stopped by officials shortly later.
They were shot and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the crime site.
The police did not go out of a terrorist background.
In the area around the Kensington Palace, several embassies are located.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

The decorative light fits harmoniously into every beet, garden area or stone garden.
The lamp is easily set up and can be anchored with 2 ground spits in the ground.

In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that flow inside color.
“Smart Stone” is harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly – optionally in white or colored light (in six different shades).
The cantonless, amorphous design is consciously chosen: Like a naturally shaped large nail, this modern light object presents itself on the day.
Its organic rounds fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the grass or in the stone beet.
He also makes himself well in the neighborhood of larger chills and findinglings, where he knows to stand up thanks to his size.
Large preparedness can be saved: as a solar light, you need neither "Smart Stone" supply nor batteries.
Set the “lightstone” in any place that is shined from the sun on the day.
Two supplied grounds provide fixed hold if needed.
The mat white plastic cover itself is robust and weather-resistant.
Its solar module hides “Smart Stone” discreetly inside, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colorful light.
The battery already charges when sunlight falls on the housing.
When invading the dawn, Smart Stone starts to self-illuminate; in which colour you determine it yourself: just six attractive light colours are at your choice – besides daylight white.
Finally, the shutdown also takes place automatically once the battery charging rate is dropped to a predetermined minimum or it becomes bright again.
Once the sun shines again, the loading cycle begins the next day from the front.
I've done that several times it doesn't work.
Sadly, I would like to have ordered with you, but if the voucher is not counted to me, then I will no longer order by principle.

In the lockdown there is no building market open anyway.
The engine control of the LokSound 5 has been basically improved.
A variable PWM-touch frequency from 10 kHz to 50 kHz provides super-smooth operation for bell anchor engines – the typical “bromming” belongs to the past.
The load control can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique Autotune function allows the automatic measurement of the decoder to the engine.
The LokSound 5 Decoder delivers enough juice for older engines with up to 1.5A motor current.

Pill problems
Hello dear women's people,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, especially because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave this back because I already have to take enough medications that I cannot choose from chronic diseases.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten from 0 to 100 explosive bumps at my last two-year-old break and everywhere.
This was so superficial, but it was very loaded to me and I didn’t feel comfortable.
During the two years of break, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this this time.
Perfume-free and gedon-free is my cosmetic already, but maybe there's what someone can recommend to me.
Women's doctor has never taken me so seriously and skin doctor's appointment is still coming.
Thank you for everyone who read the novel!
Dear skin is so much.
Had prebupertary bad neurodermitis, then a time of rest, then large-space knots and the acne theme.
I have also tried everything possible in the course of chr. disease and have remained hanging on near sugar, milk and poor meat mixed food because nothing else has worked so well.
It can also be good that hormonally just the worm is in it, but if you have anywhere like me, you prefer to stop looking for anything else wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague semina o.e.
Written and now I lost the conversation and I don’t know what was answered to my concern.
I have to always work on the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What to check if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong.
But it is generally large.
Since it is available in black large

On behalf of the people: lawful judgments
In the courtroom they sit in everyday clothes on the judge bank.
But much depends on their judgment, even if they don’t wear dress: shootings with professional judges determine whether and how long someone goes behind grids.
Two of them report in conversation with the "Oeffen" from their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of the total 125 lay judges at the John F. Kennedy Landgericht.

110-kV earth cables will be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legal.
The decision of the Government of Lower Bavaria to establish the plan releases the path for the construction, which is to begin in 2022.
Now the network operator Bayernwerk said that.
The approximately seven kilometers long earth cable will connect the Tann converse plant in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt guide between Simbach and the parish churches.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermann at Reut to a mast of the free line.
Good morning,
my order from 03.01.21 with order number #NUMBER# has so far only reached us in parts.
The blue bet number:#PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Not available for delivery".
All three other packages have arrived so that delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the further process is now?
A nice start in the week!
You can forget that, I have explained it several times yesterday!!
This is a glass commode and the entire sides are broken up, so glass lies everywhere and the cardboard is broken
The commode is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# provisions
This means that the commode cannot be picked up because no one can enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message.
Why only 20 euros?
The origin value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's all books, that's why the request at #PRS_ORG# is because it's a general problem.
Ref: Teaching Planning (EK)
Hello, dear colleagues,
I’ve been in ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I still have great problems currently to plan my teaching in the Earth’s specialty efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle, I can only use the board, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In school I can also copy only s/w for free (which is worthwhile).
I just need a long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently making the topic of geofactors and with me stands for itself every hour.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don’t want to invest too much time for simple teaching hours (which I need for UBs, etc.).
I actually always go out of the learning goal when planning (what I want to achieve) and then think about how to build it (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn’t have).
We have the book Terra and with most tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore, the worksheets also.
Perhaps a teacher of the Earth can work time-efficiently with the book.
I would really be happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I actually decided to have a new one at #PRS_ORG#, though I would like to handle the returns first time as soon as possible.
Trade is afraid of the 2G rule about Christmas business.
In most shops, only who is vaccinated or healed can be used.
Trade considers that it is unnecessary and complained.
It also has a possible solution.
The 2G rules, from the perspective of the Trade Association of Germany (HDE), break down the retail the important Christmas business.
In transactions with articles of non-daily need, sales breaches should be complained, criticized HDE chief executive Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by HDE among 1100 dealers, more than 70% of companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many have already written off the Christmas business.
"What actually should be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without ground," Genth said.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions have lost almost one-third of their pre-crisis revenues during the last week.
It runs well only in the food retail and online area.
The association calls for consequences from dramatic development.
Shopping with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, the chief executive said.
"2G is not going to continue shopping in the fight against the pandemic," he said.
Current regulations scared customers and required high employee use.
The band regime must be approved throughout the nation, he called for.
After that, each customer should only be controlled on 2G once (vaccinated or healed) and would have accessed all shops with the received band on that day.
Furthermore, in retail, as in public transport, in the 3G rule (vaccinated, genetically tested or tested), sample checks should be sufficient.
The German Euroshop real estate group, specialised in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at about 75% of the pre-corona level, sales at about 90%.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of so important Christmas business," said Chief Executive Board Wilhelm Wellner of the Economic Week.
Due to the high personal and administrative effort, the center will attempt to find and get approved solutions.
This includes the so-called bandchen solution, where, for example, visitors can once provide their 2G evidence at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - uninterruptedly enter all shops.
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also a mistake that was tried to be casted with a yellow filler.
That looks unpleasant.
I would like to return the mirror and already packed it back in the package.
How do I have to do for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
For the adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor provides exceptional possibilities.
In addition to adjusting brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and art light.
It is also possible to adjust and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K manually.
Use the current settings in the Flash Storage.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitively used.
The light generates a very light flow with soft light of high quality, completely flimmer-free.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees allowing you to illuminate large surfaces at relatively small distance is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short intervals.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller enables remote control of the light in TV studios or when the light is mounted at difficult accessible locations.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a bright display.
The display displays the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in delivery)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory spaces, it is simply depicted and finished by pressing one of the memory keys for longer time.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when turning off, so that the known situation is again when turning on - very practical at the studio work when the camera is adjusted to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the largest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the battery has enough power - it is a battery tester equally built with - for each of the two battery boxes a value in the two display displays (the left upper battery display, the right on the lower display).
Furthermore, it is of course possible to continuously supply the lighthouse with electricity via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve for attachment as a connection, allowing you to directly to your photography.
The inclination is reliably adjusted on both sides by means of detectors.
The mechanical components are also extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a snow joint includes delivery.
It is great that includes a bag.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Sadly I got the gift and she's too small :(
"Party we wanted to shake": Frankfurt celebrates after a rich comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction by Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last twice victorious Hessens were supposedly on the road to the next Bundesliga plot.
But then the SGE turned up, in a good hour shot the frustration over a broad seasonal launch of the soul and won furios with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys have done today," trainer Oliver Glasner said at DAZN and spoke a "package lobby, to everyone who was with it."
At the beginning, it looked like a new damper for the nine-ranging Frankfurters still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkusener with 2:0.
What happened then impressed the SGE trainer.
“As the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance,” said Glasner.
I am insanely happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
Defense player Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the square for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury, stressed the morality of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly large," said the 27-year-old and looked forward to the result, especially for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to make today.
For the coming tasks, however, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on itself, but it also looks well for it in terms of the staff situation.
It is exceptional that we all players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professional.
Now you want to "go step by step and remain modest" and the tasks until the year change "to this level."
Next, on Wednesday in the course of the English week, an outward match at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky) will be on the program.
Degree I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to an error on my hand.
I tried to call and redirect it at #PRS_ORG#, no chance.
Can it be shipped directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and re-submit the order?
Unfortunately, I would say that I wouldn’t order again because it’s already taken a long time.
Have you ever been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dampers for handball women for quarter finals against Spain
Germany’s handball women appeared after humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty eyes from the parquet.
At 16:32 (8:13) before 800 spectators in Granollers, the DHB selection caught a defeat and has now ran against hosts Spain in the quarter final.
"We were too frightened and had too much respect for the opponent," Bundestrainer Henk Groener said.
We have to speak differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow.
“This was a bad game from all of us that we have to delete,” Captain Emily Bölk said.
In the struggle for entry to the semi-final, against the World Cup second of 2019 on Tuesday must have a significant increase to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German launcher in the duel with the three-time Olympic winner Denmark was six-door backspace player Alina Grijseels.
“We were simply not there – neither in the attack nor in the defense,” acknowledged Xenia Smits, calling, “We need to look forward quickly now.”
Not from the front to the back at the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team with the piff was not on the height.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and defense gaps were responsible for a quick 0:4 return after seven minutes.
Only Gatefrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first gate managed to the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseel successfully closed a quick counter.
However, the initial inflammation expected was not this.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women were hardly able to set themselves in scene - and if so, they usually failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt at the gate of the Scandinavian women.
So the match was running early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially because backspace player Mia Zschocke had seen red a little later because of a hard foul on her counter-player.
However, in the quarter-final, it is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half, the DHB selection came a little better into play and until the break at least five goals.
The only silent hope for a retreat after the change was there after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener protectors sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-established opponent, who is among the medal candidates at the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer get up to an increase in performance and went as a clear loser from the parquet.

The title is supposed that I am an impharticist in mobile immune teams where (for now only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated v.a. in nursing homes.
As these are soon done to a large part, then partly goes on in vaccination centers for me.
I like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, unless they are related to one personally (e.g., "I take medication X, this depends on vaccination.").
In my field of tasks, the enlightenment for vaccination, the indication position (person has the right to vaccination according to coronavirus order and no reasons to address it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care for allergic reactions (I never happen).
The vaccination itself is delegable to qualified staff, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccinations we often do not have, however, but “only” (for God’s sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccination preparation, who cannot do vaccinations (can?), so that I also do most vaccinations there.
Heavy "Huidler" Question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidler"?
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberger, in the BR television broadcast "We're in Bavaria" has been taken care of heavy thought.
However, unlike many previous days, the term remained in the series "Host mi" this time unrated by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who is nervous."
And none of them “to go all quickly.”
This, people heard from the TV moderator, was completely wrong.
What the man from Amberg announced about the solution, and thus probably made surprises for many superficials.
“The Huidler,” the spectators learned, “is a lap with which someone washs the oven.”
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, asked by Bavarian television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical upper-falcian term, derived somehow from the rather well-known word "Houdern".
With which an educational gap was closed - probably also with some who have been living in the Amberg room for a long time.
I can’t buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, it always comes the following error message: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected, synchronized and repaired to the PC.
Nothing helped.
Tire choice at the racing bike - really so fail-safe?
Today tomorrow I woke up full of action because I wanted to work at least a little to prepare my bicycle tour next week.
Said, done, and I went on with my racing bike that I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then what happened in such a city centre (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glass splitter on the track.
Zack, loud zicking and my rear tire did not want to participate the rest of the track at all.
Because I had no real way to get my replacement coat and replacement hose due to the week day, I had to turn back with half-way bad mood and take the first train home.
Then it wasn’t so bad in a technical way, perhaps it’s better if I’m practicing that with the tire change before the bike tour again.
Now I stand on a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance for several days before me, I would get extremely unwanted to this problem more often.
Now it wasn’t really bad, even the old tyres from the previous owner (very nice old man, on the day I picked up the bike I’ve broken up to 120km!) and who had already called them as sub-optimal because he’s driven rolling with them for years.
But if I think that I have to make a tire change while driving after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really badly funny :D
Now I came to talk with an older man at the railway station who wondered me why I didn’t have the Marathon Plus tyres; these should be flat-free.
Now, of course, the whole sounds very attractive.
But are they really so incapable?
I don’t want to spend €40 per tires now, just to be disappointed.
I still ask myself: I've got 25x622 on the race bike right now.
Although there are also (seemly?) tires at the Marathon Plus, most of them are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me about other tyres on a racing bike?
The Schwalbe page seems to be absolute to myself! League knowledge is rather recommended to the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and dear greetings!

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would get background.
SOLO 15 is called the new sprössling and visually reminds of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction suggestion, a suitable designed foot is directly included to lift the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted in length according to the conditions at home.
The SOLO 15 is very well suited for people in whom the maximum volume plays a rather lower role, but soundly to achieve an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply unable to generate almost unfiltered so large sound pressure levels.
This does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it is greatly grown and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
The SOLO 15 was matched with a slight high-tone rise.
This is generally common in broadbands to optimize the greatly increasing bundling of too high frequencies.
Exactly focused on the hearing space, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound.
Easily rotated outwardly, the high-tone range can be reduced and thus the sound image can be designed warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a music piece in the optimal stereo triangle is measuring shaft and amazingly precise.
The suspected reference extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure an enemy dynamics seeks the same.
The SOLO 15 not only supplements our SOLO series, but expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our sets, it is recommended to think about the final optics of the speaker at the beginning in order to plan appropriate changes in the construction.
For example, if you want to furnish the housing, the reduction of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the furnish again contains material.
After all plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill a 8 mm hole into the bottom plate at the appropriate spot to be able to perform the cable there later easily.
With the help of an upper milling, the speaker opening is now followed in the front, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be later used.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° fase to make the opening surface of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM have an interruption in the fase, as shown in the "Detail Fase" picture.
Then you begin with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls in front of you on a flat surface.
The rear wall, the lid, the front and the ground are now slipped onto them.
The three stirrings should also be used and glued.
The stirrings themselves may vary in the material thickness if necessary, if you want to use, for example, finished bars from the construction market rather than make them themselves from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step of work, the second side will be placed.
Afterwards, all the plates of the foot follow, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole circle saw or a forest drill, the attachment of the openings of the bass reflection tube, as well as the connection clamp on the back wall, is facilitated.
Then you use a round freser to surround all edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded.
Afterwards, the footplate is fixedly glued with the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
It follows the drawing and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points of the speaker chassis and the connection clamp.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suck / blow), you start laying the cable.
This is the simplest possible by the 35 mm bass reflection opening in the back wall.
In this case, the entire and uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm drilling into the foot to the terminal opening and allows it to stand out there approximately 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is carried out to the speaker opening and it also leaves it loosely out there.
The frequency differences are prepared and used below.
The construction plan of the frequency welding, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document: Assembly instructions Wet Solo 15.
If the frequency welding is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the seal of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is followed, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm BASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, hot adhesives can be dropped to the opening and thus closed.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, the seal can be checked accordingly.
According to the description, the defense follows.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be destroyed at the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflection tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
A mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass-reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I make an order now and deliver it until early June?
> Hello to all,
> Finally, we can announce that we will host the OSCAST again this year too!
Unfortunately, for known reasons it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning burden and explains the short-term of the announcement.
But: There will be at least three people per switch, so we will track the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it’s still pandemic – yet we’ll give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Get cold drinks, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
