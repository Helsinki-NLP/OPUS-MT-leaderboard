Right-wing populist triumphs in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to the preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a sensitive weakening of the two parties forming the current major coalition, as well as a notorious reinforcement of the populist parties.
The Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Governor of Carinthie Jörg Haider, prepares a triomphal return to the political scene at the national level.
According to the preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 percent of the votes, the country’s first political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 percent of the votes.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent loses nearly nine percent of the votes, ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; especially for the popular party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
As of early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People’s Party had a considerable advance on the SPÖ.
However, the voters were visiblely punished for allowing the government to collapse.
From the early reactions to the results, speculation on the possible resignation of the party chief and current vice chancellor Wilhelm Molterer were issued.
The observers believe that this could happen as of Monday, during the extraordinary council of the party’s management.
Such evolution would a priori facilitate the path towards the outcome of the most likely outcome of the election, namely the renewal of the great SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
Nevertheless, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the free (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 per cent and the BZÖ eleven per cent of the votes - the socialists at the same time expressed fear of a repeat of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still unified of the common government, the BZ in 2005.
Haider, who already said he was ready to collaborate with any party and planned to return to Vienna on the national political stage, apparently put on this evolution.
The last party to have access to parliament was the Greens, but they lost slightly and returned, among the Austrian political parties, from the third in fifth position.
Obviously, no other party crosses the limit of four percent and accesses the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India Risk to Cool
If we could not resolve the problem with Czech researchers accused of illegal collection of cows in India, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said it would follow a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister today declared it in New York after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem wasn't solved, then yes, some cooling would occur," he said after the meeting, carried out after a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, leaving talks, that executive power could hardly intervene in judicial affairs.
Nevertheless, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was discharged from the charge and punished by a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, with the case being placed under its jurisdiction.
"The problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher instance.
Therefore, he could ask for freedom under caution and wait for the judgment in freedom, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirms that his partner expressed himself in the same direction as during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, as a result of what he could be grateful," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide convicts with "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
He also says that such aid was already provided to them from India as well.
“We wish above all to keep the best relationships with India, which have a tradition that continues for many years.
Indians also recognize it,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he pointed out in front of his partner that the Czech Republic was very important to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We consider the imprisonment and accusation of these Czech researchers as a great despise," he said.
The minister removed the question whether he obtained from India the promise to take care of the case.
"I've already received a lot of promises," he said only.
A Czech arbitrates the struggle for the bottom of the sea
It approaches a wall electronic card, on which is represented Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
It is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent sea bottom.
This area is, however, as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30 members of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and Sea Law.
His chief, the director of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and complete it from time to time.
Earth to work and enthusiasm characterize the reigning atmosphere.
The marine bottom hides a little known world so far, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found, but also living organisms for unknown moments, which may contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A larger background than the firm land
The coastal states have begun today aspire to new submarines.
According to a UN Convention, they actually use their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is called the continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
This latter may, according to the convention, exclusively claim all the resources of the continental shelf.
“To simplify, the part of the marine bottom and its basement is considered to be a continental shelf, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the borders of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred marine miles that represent the so-called exclusive economic yone,” explains Mikulka.
The request for the country in question to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a wide-ranging scientific-technical documentation based on many prospects and expensive metrics.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
“One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
So far, the committee has dealt with five requests, including Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the moment, only the last three mentioned countries have been successful," added Mikulka.
The success of Australia, which is the first to have significantly expanded its underwater possessions, recently experienced a global resonance.
New Zealand has also gained territory - the extent of the marine bottom, which the commission attributed to it last week, is 1.6 million square kilometers, which represents the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospects.
The benefit they will benefit in the future of the exploitation of the marine bottom will be, as they are projected, invaluable.
Progressively, other countries will, in turn, make their request.
They can do so within ten years after ratification of the "Montego Bay Convention".
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean bottom, proclaimed by convention "common patrimony of humanity".
There no more states have an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by agreement.
"Let's not mistaken, the marine background is not a Klondike," he said, exaggerating Director Mikulka, specifying that "these areas are precisely clearly defined and their regime is anchored in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the marine background is also part of the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former block of Eastern countries as part of the joint organisation "Interoceanmetal".
It obtained in 1991, under the convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of the one called "a pioneer investor".
It has the right to extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and the Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the surface of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is moving, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"It is possible to extract on an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a landscape rich in polymetallic creations containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” listed Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, brings an example of such a concrete.
She recalls a little potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to the legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were on site for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had asked for Germany’s help in resolving the hostage crisis – experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready but never moved to action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are revealed.
According to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Defense, German special forces also participated in the rescue operation indirectly.
Thus, both federal army specialists and GSG 9 officials, federal police aerial squad and federal criminal police office, as well as logistics experts at Technische Hilfwerk were on the place of liberation.
As the Ministry spokesman said on Monday evening, the German forces were finally not required, hostages had released their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminence of a liberation by force.
The Egyptian government would have accepted the assistance offered by Germany to integrate it on site as a support force.
"Fortunately, it hasn't happened until now," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of Interior said.
The aggressors had kidnapped the group of tourists in southern Egypt composed of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanians and their eight Egyptian companions.
After their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, hostages were transferred to the border zone between Egypt, Lybia, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages has so far remained vague, as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who were saved came healthy and except in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin at the moment, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine Bild, the five vacationers and special forces should have left on board an Airbus Air Force and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
Chamber of U.S. Representatives Refuses Rescue Plan
The U.S. Congress’s first chamber failed the heavy $700 billion financial market rescue plan.
The Dow Jones came into the abyss.
With 227 votes against 206, the U.S. Chamber of Representatives rejected the rescue plan for government financial markets.
Despite all the calls by President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of the two parties, the program that was supposed to struck the chaos of the financial markets did not obtain the majority.
In a dramatic manoeuvre, the supporters had desperately attempted to convince opponents of the founded good of this $700 billion heavy plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called on MEPs to vote favorable although the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not happened yet," he said.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones dropped by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the state rescue plan could capote.
It dates back shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of failure, fall again.
Experts are now proposing new serious turbulence on international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, approval and chamber of Members and the Senate are necessary.
Organizers report an increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of reservations for the next months, according to a study, the revenue figure has increased significantly compared to the previous year - even more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak conjunctural prospects, the thirst for travel of Germans remains insatiable according to this study.
Regarding reservations for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a revenue of more than 31 percent compared to the same period the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) entrusted Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute’s survey, growing numbers of reservations already dominate in the fall months.
Thus, the sales figure would have risen to approximately 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV entrusted.
The sources of these results are the GfK figures, which analyses booking data from 1,200 travel agencies monthly and making estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be registered there.
Due to the low price of the dollar, travel to the United States would be particularly demanded, the DRV said.
There, the increase in reservations would amount to approximately one Third.
In addition to this, Spain, Turkey, Greece and our country would be destinations particularly sought by the Germans.
The particularly organized trips are very demanded, DRV President Klaus Laepple explained.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food, the costs would be "more easily calculable for the customer than for an individually organized trip".
Consumers can save money among others with early booking discounts or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Summer months have also been highly reduced so that an increase in sales figures will be recorded again compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who have undertaken a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
First time at the Beer Party
The hits of Ballermann or Apres-Ski continuously, from beer in liter pitches and celebrities in tyrol designer costumes.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I actually didn’t have much in common.
She is blonde, television animator and wears a custom Tyrolian costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes with the beer party, and photographers already throw on us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and that at my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolian costume seems to achieve its goal.
As a tourist of the beer party and normally inhabiting north of the Weißwurst equator, my feeling of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once on Teresa Square, everything is half less worse.
Each or almost wearing a tyrol costume or leather pants; no one looks blashed or affected by shame - this is completely normal.
Only the table of my Tyrolian costume collects a few bizarre eye shots at the shoco banana stand.
A Bavarian notes me that I would have misbound my board: "To the left means free, in the virgin middle, to the right, to the back widow."
Discreetly, I trip my loop from the back to the left.
"It's better," she said and laughs.
Others don’t get so bad for these subtle techniques of flirting and wear simple feathers, on which it is written “Too drunk to get dressed!” and we expose their naked back train without being invited there.
The exhibitionist attitude young man is named Bob, arrives from England and comes for the first to the beer party.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an "oooo" liening.
He tells me all this after relieving from the chop he had drinked before.
Directly next to this fire mouth everyone thinks it's a garbage.
So Bob is one of these sadly famous "wild pishers".
Others do not have the chance to get rid of alcohol in this way.
About eight o'clock in the evening, rescue rims run on the party square and need to take care of the poor drinkers.
Nurses rather move on - always by four, they drag their tent-covered cave into tents.
This is how it works for most visitors to the beer party: we go empty, we come back full of it.
Those who rest in the bowl of boiled under the blade are not visible.
“These are those who can no longer swallow anything,” one of the helpers cries to me in response to my question and disappears in the mixture.
Victim of accident identified by police
A 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident in town on Shenfield Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but later died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested because he was suspected of dangerous driving.
He has been released since, under caution.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons.
Much before Turkey planned to join the European Union, the European powers were looking forward to entering its background.
On the east side of the Bosphorus, 20 steps away, from Asia, is one of the finest relics of his fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least this is what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged by horse at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation tower at each of its angles, such as some German provincial towns.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruin.
But once inside the bowed ticketing, we have no doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The train station was opened in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, retardant to the game of imperialism, wanted to achieve its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad, as well as the land most known as Saudi Arabia.
But the German imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding area, generated by the ice borders of the Cold War, is over.
The British and Empire forces advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say it is a sabotage.
Since then, she has slowly fallen into ruin, swallowed in the meandres of history.
But today, the railway passage to Anatolia and all the eastern points is at least symbolically used to emphasize the expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the ice borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relationships with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian fractions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on a bed wagon towards Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish AKP MP Suât Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a 10-and-a-half-hour trip, shaken on noisy rails whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital presented as a new city of a new century state, turning back to its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamist roots is an example of change in Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, expressly built in stones and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by half-built shopping centres and numerous pastures in which middle managers in cravate-men and women-meet for morning affairs.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a right-wing politician from any other party in Europe.
Dress up, cravate and he even has a Black Berry.
“The aim of this foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighborhood.
“The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its rear country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
That wasn't the case with each other.
She had to do both.
“But, at some point, I asked if Turkey shouldn’t choose?”
“Turkey doesn’t want to have to choose between the two.”
He subsequently emphasized an aspect that almost everyone I could talk with recited by heart: The Turkish railway is not only going towards the Middle East, but also towards the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, therefore, it is both an advantage for Europe and the United States and for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a metaphorically traveling Europe on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
After returning to Hydarpasha station, after another night without sleep, I rethink the two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the Middle East's European ambitions could largely be in Turkey's hands.
As I was waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period during which Turkey had been named "the sick of Europe".
At least there is no doubt on the continent that could pretend that fascinating country.
Memories of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Head of music at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (deceased September 11) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Taking part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic choir of young people, Proteus.
The choir had to include the less than 21 years, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 years old refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed form according to mythology) represented the choir's will and empowerment to manage any kind of music that was presented to him, whether it was madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, and this thanks to the inspiration of a single man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how much Tod repeated us to "leave music speaks for itself."
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
Everything is here, in music.
So sing!"
His baguette technique was absolutely clear, precise, even though it was never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much above.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be named Knight, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years, I have watched over a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me—and some times they have even inspired me.
Tod Handley had such a rare combination of personal size and modesty.
He hated drivers who, he says, “focus only on some people.”
Many of us will miss.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
His necrology by William Woodruff (deceased September 25) states that "in 1946, he had resumed his studies in economic history, in Oxford, and became a member of Houblon-Norma research in 1950, while he was BSc, MA and PhD."
That's what's from Woodruff's letter in Beyond Nab End, but that's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor in economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time ended a PhD thesis on British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at the Norman Houblon, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham to Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
“I recommend José Vicente Resino’s exhibition “Flamenco and Life” because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have drawn me the attention because of their simplicity and strength they transmit and because they always deal with the protagonists with much respect.
An exhibition that transmits a lot of feelings.
Resino can capture magical moments.”
Second assault for Honda's super sales
In November, Honda will start the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz model.
Although its predecessor already had good habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
A few refined mechanics are added, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of a revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz features a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them is an innovative design, a new platform, bigger dimensions and new engines.
Before examining the new model, however, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the first generation’s launch on the market.
First of all, Honda has renovated this model within a shorter period than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, the Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
In Japan, nearly a million Honda Jazz has been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less one million cars sold in six years, is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new jazz will enable it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it thinks of selling 100,000, which would represent a 17% growth in sales in the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 jazz since 2002, which accounts for 6.7% of Honda’s sales in Spain.
The officials of the Spanish subsidiary hope to sell 2,000 jazz in a year.
This is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to palliate largely the decline in sales in Spain.
Indeed, brand officials hope to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars that is 4,000 in less than in 2007, which is a 16% decrease in sales.
Thanks to this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, ratio of 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to obtain a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model will be released.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size – 4.37 meters long – which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
According to Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of Insight’s sales will be made in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first three months of next year, following its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 metres (five centimeters in addition), its width 1.69 metres (two centimeters in addition) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 metres, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change 1.52 meters.
The dimensions increase and the interior space also increase.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of a gasoline reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the safety box - which has a double background system - can contain up to 399 liters, 19 liters of capacity more than the first generation safety box.
Note that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L box is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as the rear lights or the panoramic roof - is the improvement of access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, part of the rear doors of the first jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
Engines are also new on this second generation of jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2 and 1.4 liter petrol propulsors.
The two engines have an i-VTEC technology that reduces petrol consumption and CO2 emission, which makes the engine more powerful and increases the engine power.
The first 1.2 liter engine develops a power of 90 horses at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This driver, which on the previous jazz reached 78 horses, has a petrol consumption of 5.3 litres at 100 km and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
Compared to the previous driver, which in the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reached 100 horses.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres at 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bees car' that avoids collision
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company created a robot that, by imitating the bees’ flight, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Centre have created this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research from the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director-General of Public Relations for Technology and Marketing Research and Development, the BR23C represents the Nissan Security Shield.
This robot will allow the brand’s vehicles to prevent collision.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space in an oval shape that looks a lot like the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important is the eyes composed of the bee, capable of seeing in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers developed what is called a Laser Range Finder (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the obstacles that are at a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor immediately to avoid the obstacle.
“At the time he detects an obstacle, the little robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by bifurking its 90-degree or more wheels to avoid collision.
The biggest difference to any other existing system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
If that was the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Movement Laboratory and senior engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned up or down or in diagonal; it can move only in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like the bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotational function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
“Each second this device must only process information and act according to those data.
It doesn’t need to keep the information or the intuitive logic of prior maneuvers, that’s why it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB memory.
This may surprise, but we do not talk about gigabytes of memory, nor even megabytes.”
This represents the first cause of developing new collision instant prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced in serial cars within a decade after Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last more than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a satellite navigation GPS system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding road barriers.
They are afraid of being hypothecated
It must be recognized that the US Treasury, besides having a lot of liquid to make plans, is not lacking of genius.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking in mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is, "the hotel of bad credits" or stories.
The lizard aspect of this accommodation and especially the Hotel Master leads us to think often if it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And above all, where to do it.
It is sure that this game gives useful but little detailed information.
It is more a game for teenagers.
What to do if the game ends?
Because a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It’s better than nothing, because it’s unthinkable to buy a house.
Morgan Stanley opens capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced his turn to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s first bank, who will pay nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new hosted by a strong decline in its exchange rate.
A week after unveiling a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of ordinary Morgan Stanley shares at a single price of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The retained price is 19% below the accounting value of securities as of 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible securities guaranteeing it a 10% yield and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the overall transaction would be carried out on the basis of an average unit price of $29, 28% above its current price.
The Morgan Stanley share, however, lost 6.79% to $23.07 around 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to bank holding status,” said John Mack, CEO of the U.S. group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but to pass it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest names of Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed in the last few days: Monday, Morgan just announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, said, “we thought the participation would be fully composed of ordinary shares.
But given the current situation in the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize risks and cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its securities Morgan Stanley 7% below their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per action.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in one year if they exchange more than 50% above the conversion price, at about $47, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that MUFG’s capital will enable it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
However, a group spokesman has refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to display a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he has "netally" mitigated his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been attempting for the group, who saw its exchange course melting half as the cost of insurance against a defect risk on its debt was flying.
This cost refluered Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, alone another “survivor” of the major Wall Street investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers’ bankrupts and Merrill Lynch’s purchase, announced to have raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Refounded the republic around socialism of the 21st century.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, it was the third one who put a draft new Constitution to the voice.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted “yes” at the referendum, according to official results of 80% of votes.
According to these results, the "no" achieved 28%, 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two surveys carried out at the exit of the voting offices and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a wide “yes” victory, between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution in the night of Sunday to Monday.
The "Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly," he assured, congratulating the Equatorians at the headquarters of Guayaquil Governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales as well as his Chilian counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place in calm according to the Observation Mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), focused on a 444-point text consolidating the President’s defended “new socialism”.
The draft Constitution devotes the State’s power on the economy, reserved the “planning of development” of a country living essentially from oil extraction by foreign companies and the currency that its immigrants send.
The draft, elected by Correa in 2006, also grants strengthened powers to the head of state, who will be able to perform up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he would use this power and strike a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President began establishing in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives under the threshold of poverty.
It finally provides for the ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuador base as the starting point of U.S. drug operations.
The 19 hostages have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault against the kidnappers of eleven tourists and their eight accompaniers captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back on Monday afternoon to the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at around 15:30 a.m. on board a special aircraft at the al-Maza military base, joined at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to talk to the press, on board helicopters to the Maadi hospital, a residential outskirts of Cairo, to undergo examinations.
They're in "good health," and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 in a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been voted from one hidden to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanians - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard and the director of the safari organizator Aegyptus.
An Egyptian safety official said 30 special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the attack in the night just before dawn.
"A fire exchange happened, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fled," said the official who requested anonymity.
He said that 150 Egyptian special forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commando.
Head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through professionalism and the effectiveness of our men of secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
On the previous day, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board, killing six, including the Chadian chief, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement had immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes the headlines and occupies the current electoral campaign.
It's better.
But a sector of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the amounts of misery given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or national historical places hungry?
Which politician will dare remind the federal government that he neglects his monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don’t have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to the restoration of the only Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that heritage protection is part of the American culture and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and this, in consultation.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Quebec’s History Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers grouped into 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned about searching history, preserving with three pieces of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
These are often the guard dogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers throw their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemetery.
When is a tribune for history and heritage?
Benelux Governments Nationalize Part of the Fortis Bank
The Benelux states assist the Belgium-Dutch bank, as the first European bank institution in distress due to the snowball effect of the U.S. credit market crisis, by partially nationalizing it. The three countries support, up to EUR 11.2 billion, this financial institution and insurance institution also possessing interest.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, also calling for the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition official.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis has been increasing for more than a year, is for the Fortis Bank. From a certain point of view, decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will redeem nearly half (49 percent) of the bank’s capital in each of the countries.
The bank will, without a doubt, sell a portion of its shares, including, first of all, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch body ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis shares began a stunning drop, and in the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to let it go to bankruptcy.
Only Friday, the company’s shares dropped by 12 percent to reach its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, stocks have fallen by more than two-thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group’s capital is around €14 billion, which, according to society leaders, is not realistic.
The company’s leadership accuses the uncertainty of over-Atlantic, in relation to the adoption of the US $700 billion rescue plan, of being the cause of the fall of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank as a new chief executive officer.
The financial agency was also looking for private purchasers, but has not yet received a proposal on the ground.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not be worried, they would not lose their money.
No panic has been felt in the bank’s customer circle and no agency has been taken of assault.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent agencies and has also purchased leasing companies.
A ridge in the chicken
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about their purchases of drugs.
Experts in information protection are afraid that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that binds the use of information concerning the prescription of medicines, in any case, to the agreement of the data subject.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is to entrust his chicken to a pig," said Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage medication prescriptions, at the Washington Post.
Insurance companies are dependent on the insurance premium and insured capital in the event of damage, the health status of the customer who presents themselves, and if they believe that the risk is too large, they do not even guarantee it.
In the past, they sent candidates for a medical examination, and they signed an insurance contract with them only after took awareness of the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, it is easily provided with pharmacies, data about the purchase of drugs of the person within the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines itself what illness the person is suffering from, and what is his health status.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducing, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts it into a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, so there is nothing left to do with the insurer except the paperwork. However, tiny problems may still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or heat bubbles, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others do not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of data, and they must ask for authorization from the patient before collecting necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are constrained by the authorities, even though they have not been sanctioned for their faults in the past.
Some companies have recently also processed the results of laboratory analyses, and link them to the data on drug consumption, in this way they are able to provide even more accurate portrait of patients’ health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and the control of use is becoming increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate medical data protection law, but its scope of action extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill on the expansion of the control circle of authorities concerning companies specialized in data supply is currently in front of the Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not sufficient and that is why he has developed his program further, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the data subject.
This is another question of whether the data subject is truly free to agree or not, since if he refuses, the insurances do not sign a contract with him.
Thus and ultimately, the chickens depend on the kindness of the cow.
The overall menu of Marseille
The European Union and India multiply their trade by two.
Since the European Union and India are very important trade partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside the other problems, largely globally.
Today, a French-India summit will also be held where it will be mainly about cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union acknowledges that India is a great emerging democratic power to which it should be given wider speech right in international affairs, but member countries have not yet agreed on their support to New Delhi for its nomination as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
Yesterday, at the 9th summit held in Marseille, they have not been too deeply delighted on this issue.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Head of Diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would multiply by two trade trades, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, it does not seem to be a too ambitious goal.
In this sense, they have legally harmonised the 26 bilateral agreements on civil flights with India, so that air trade will also be able to grow in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with on one side, India, which is the first trade partner in the EU, and on the other, New Delhi, which is only the ninth place among EU partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan has been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and it has been discussed the urgency of holding a UN conference on this issue.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle was also requested, although both have a large part in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate programme, including that it would like to decrease its releases of toxic materials by at least twenty percent by 2020.
India also agreed on this issue, as well as the fact that a global market should be placed at the next year's climate conference, and to reduce the emission of greenhouse gas by fifty percent until 2050.
They would also like to prevent the rise in food prices, and supported the convention of an international working meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state is now going to the French capital, where he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy during a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders for the construction of Indian atomic reactors worth €20 billion.
According to the news agency's information, the agreement would be about 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than 300 Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Hall.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international appointment in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Salon awaits for this edition, more than 7 exhibition miles from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Salon with more than 403 thousand exhibition titles, and Turkey as an honor guest.
This will be the Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Property and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Papillon: in fact, Italy will be present in an institutional way, with a Point of Italy-264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the meeting with the press in the Room Structure, at the butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospective on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to data, the importance of foreign author books gradually decreases compared to the total Italian production, and in particular, compared to that for adults and children.
Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire disappeared a year ago.
Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007 as he was flying on the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris were found on a 3,000-metre altitude plateau in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, at the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson told the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that it's the one that Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff said that no human remains were found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) announced that a few hours after the tracking of the spake, a team of investigators sent to the site identified the device: it’s the Bellanca 8kcab, missing on September 3, 2007, when Fosset dropped from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the border of Nevada, some personal property from Fosset were found by a couple around their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fosset, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, money and a pull.
Fossett’s research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the round of the world on an aerostatic ball: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later, he had traveled around the world by plane and unstopped.
Among all these records, also that of stealing at 15,445 meters in height, on the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect.
A 4x4 out of the common of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, with large surfaces and net angles.
Here, in synthesis, Glk is the last born of the "compact" off road of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a new wind in this sector.
Just because of its non-standard, unexpected and non-conventional content, it will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, as of 17 October.
Thus, the advertising beat that will accompany the start of the new car will result in an unprecedented communication modality, through a futuristic 3D display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automobile brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milan shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides the presentation of the auto in stereoscopical vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimension and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, we'll feel like looking at the picture, the self comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elimina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, to then recompose itself in a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertising, Mercedes tries to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of car communication.
Will she succeed with this formula to raise the interest of the future acquiring? We will see well.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy is ashamed now? They are part of the "Ultras Italy" group who has been following the Italian national team for years, and who, until now, had never created big problems.
He had never been hit with the Tiphosi adversaries.
The extraction from the group is on the right.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (poorly actually) of Campania and Puglia added.
They had tricolor flags on which their origin city appeared: Saturday evening, they were all kidnapped to not be identified.
They are inspired by the English tifoseries.
In Bulgaria, they found a tifoserie of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available the Italian tifosi, 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had in fact all controlled them: among those who went to Sofia, none had a Daspo underway, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian tifosi who had stadium crime history, did not have the right to the ticket, and could not travel.
Now the Viminal awaits reading the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and then take action: in this case, the Tifosi arrested or identified in disorders may purge a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that prohibits attending Italian, but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer stand at the stadium.
Luckily.
But now is the time of fear-emulation: that is, others are likely to add to the first one hundred fifty.
"We must turn off this fire immediately, and not legitimate who behaves so," the Viminal said.
So, "keep your eyes well open, especially for the match of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce"
In Puglia there is indeed a small core of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory, the Casms, meets on Tuesday, which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is, secret services, which just address stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the arm stretched during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime."
Here is Domenico Mazzilli's opinion (really unpleasantly expressed) recently, director of the Observatory of the Viminal (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste, where he lies in a core of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 typhosis has been shameful.
“I am not a sociologist,” adds the No. 1 of the Observatory, “the crimes must be assigned in the country in which the fact occurs.
So far, this group has been in rules, and now we will see what happened, and we will assess for the future.
But we also talk about siffles towards Mameli's anthem: those there are not crimes, but if you allow me, they are not polished.
