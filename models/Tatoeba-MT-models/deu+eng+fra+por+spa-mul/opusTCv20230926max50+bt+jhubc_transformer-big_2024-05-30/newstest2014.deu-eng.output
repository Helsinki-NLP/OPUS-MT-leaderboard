More safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters away from each other: On Tuesday, in Gutach, the new B 33-foot walking ramp has been taken into operation at the village parking space - in the vision of the older city lamp.
Two facilities so close to each other: intent or shield citizenship?
This question was answered clearly yesterday.
"The town house was installed then because it secures the school path," Eckert said yesterday.
The Kluser-Ampel safely offers both cyclists and bus passengers and mountain residents.
The plant officially operated yesterday is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, the park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank, as well as the flow of traffic from the residential area ‘Grub’.
“At the high traffic and pedestrian rise, there had to be another light for their safety,” Eckert said.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold from Offenburg.
“These current measurements are carried out on the B 33 approximately 12,000 vehicles daily, of which about 10 percent are heavy load traffic,” Arnold said.
Therefore, the construction of another lighting is more than necessary: "Safety is simply going on here," Arnold said.
In total, four traffic shows have been carried out, but also a circulation was considered, however, because of the narrow in the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing area.
According to Arnold, everything was previously tested at the location choice of the light masts: “A medium of an extra carrier for us with very long wood stames we have evaluated whether these vehicles can ride from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without rewinding the light mass.”
The approximately €15,000 expensive lamp system itself is the "moderniest that is currently available on the market," Arnold explained.
The facility is equipped with colourful LEDs that shine so strongly that the lights of the drivers can be well recognized, for example, even in the deep sun.
And it is also saving: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
Per drive direction there are three lighting systems.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
The pedestrian presses the light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is free, it immediately comes green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
"If a group or disabled people should go through the street, the green phase is extended, so everyone will come safely through the road," Arnold said.
Of course, the driver must think here as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: little showed the light for pedestrians green, a high-class vehicle sounded through - with bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and youth from his soul for more than 30 years.
The disasters of his Catholic village childhood - the voicelessness, the slowness to raw violence and stuffed sexuality, the narrowness and freudelessness - has described the Kärntner many times.
The Büchner prize winner is known primarily as a prosa author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage of prosatexts Gerhard Fresacher makes up a collage of prosatexts for his performance "Weather Lights on the top of the tongue", which is now seen in the garage X on Petersplatz.
The theatremaker combines elements from the autobiographically characterized novel "The Slaveigene" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, his family beautiful" (2003).
On the vastly empty stage - important requisite: a cracked sofa, on which it is in a meaning copulated and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs through the text material.
The director Fresacher seems little to trust the text.
The 70-minute performance overwhelms the template with an abundance of directories, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic game modes.
Especially the actors have sometimes doubtful scenic implementations.
They are harshly touched, dipped underwater with their head, with their evening clothes to the wall.
Constrained in cellophan or middle, they stack on dangerously high stacks through the inscene, either monologize them loudly or lie completely silently on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly communicated in this strengthened manner.
The best moments have the evening when singing - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to a popular song.
Only to the end the overturned performance comes somewhat quiet, and Winkler's nearly absurd humor shines.
A blackbox in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the devastating highway system, and believe that they have found the solution in a small black box that will find place in the board of each car.
The devices that record each kilometre driven and report the information to the authorities are the core of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to revise the outdated system to finance US roads.
The generally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly unleashed an intense debate with colourful alliances.
Libertarians have allied with environmental groups and are assuming that the government can use the small boxes to record the driven kilometers – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax deficits.
The tea party is shocked.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection issues.
However, while you cannot agree to an action at Congress, several states no longer wait.
You are currently checking how you can switch to a system over the next 10 years to pay for drivers per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the driving writers, some of whom are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s nothing we might only use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the miles driven by all Californian drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is here.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes paying Americans on the pitch column, is pledged.
In America, however, is no longer done as much as before.
Cars consume less petrol.
State oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 eurocents per liter) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax at high prices of syringe even for one cent.
“Gasoline tax is simply unsustainable,” says Lee Munnich, a traffic law expert at the University of Minnesota.
Its state has recently equipped 500 cars with driving writers to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the most significant alternative in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea of urban liberals finds an accusation, for example, the tax could be used to affect driving behaviour in such a way that stake and climate-harmful exhaust gases are reduced.
California’s planners rely on the system in developing strategies to achieve the state’s ambitious, legally anchored targets on climate change.
However, the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also declared that he see the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also appealed to the idea of paying drivers on the way.
“This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” explains Adrian Moore, Vice President of Reason Policy.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in a 2011 report asked the Congress to move towards mile-based billing.
Last year, the US Senate approved a $90 million expensive pilot project that would include 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the outbreak and thus reacted to the concerns of rural deputies represented by people who often have to leave many miles on the way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Several states and major cities nevertheless move on their own in this direction.
The most committed is Oregon, which currently acquires 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the miles fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also considers such a thing.
Illinois tests it in limited dimension with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the eastern coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, drivers were skeptical in the thought that the government could track any of their movements.
“Memories against Big Brother and such things were a big problem,” explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Results Management at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
People didn't want it.
When the test started, Nevada’s ACLU warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the ride writers into adult surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data about individuals’ daily movements.
Nevada belongs to a number of states now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to capture the driven kilometres, but not exactly when and where.
Thus, Khan said, the public would be more calm.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not start to help states in taxing drivers.
Rather, their goal was to catch foot in an emerging vehicle insurance market where drivers should pay on the basis of driven miles.
However, the devices tested by them are also interesting for road planners, because they don’t work with GPS and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
“People are rather willing to participate when their speed and locations are not recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programs have made great mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment to give drivers a number of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no device at all and instead pay a package fee based on the average miles driven by all inhabitants of the state.
Other jobs hope to be able to sell the concept of a mistrustful public by equiping the devices with more functions than less.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a tax equipment that can also be paid parking fees, insurance only needs to be paid for driven kilometres, and speed data from other vehicles can be collected in real time thanks to the driver’s capacity to evade.
“Drivers would be motivated by the added value of the advantages that the system offers to participate,” the city’s planning document states.
However, some traffic planners wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area officials declared that Congress could solve the problem of the bankruptcy Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel tax.
An additional single fee or annual charge could be charged by drivers using hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little fuel, so they also pay a fair share.
“There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient,” explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission’s head of legislation and public affairs.
When we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things.
Kingsfield: Small team beats wacky
The volunteers managed their autumn head trials with bravour despite lack of staff.
Only eleven men participated in the exercise.
Department Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property Feder in Burgberger Straße in his exercise.
There has been a short-circuit during sawing.
Due to the fire and smoke development, two people were injured, but one of them could send another emergency call.
Two respiratory protectors of the Wehr were prepared to enter the building after Hans Kammerer’s first review of the situation.
After a short time, he managed to find the first person and lead to the free.
The second person had to be worn.
This wasn’t so easy because it was also a narrow staircase to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stall for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stood a lot of wood and straw balls in it.
Furthermore, there were electrical machines for wood processing.
The first removal attack was carried out via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was carried out via an overflowing hydrant at about 100 meters away.
Now three solving attacks were designed.
A hollow beam tube was used in the building too.
Hans Kammerer also went on to show what to be done with little staff available.
In case of emergency, support is made through the Königsfeld day-to-day intervention group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies is important
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Höchschwarzwald, Landtag President Guido Wolf was also allowed to find out where tomorrow’s workers came.
At the High Schwarzwald Support Centre he went to the heads of the vocational schools and the Circular Gymnastics and the parental advisory chairman of this important issue.
"Education is an important location factor," said Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who introduced the interconnected school project Hochschwarzwald Education Centre.
Wolf was impressed with the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation in the forest city between support center, circle gymnasium and vocational school center.
He also praised the family friendliness in the county.
“It’s important not only to look at the family phase, but because of the demographic change, also the phase of care for family members,” Wolf explained.
In addition, he suggested that more and more employees were taking care of their relatives and care.
“Without employers’ support, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship,” Wolf said.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"Because whoever has already learned the benefits of the region during his studies, often remains maintained by its acquired knowledge and skills in the regional economy, which contributes to strengthening the region," the Landtag President said.
Because only if sufficient training jobs were offered, professional needs could also be covered.
In his opinion, the advantage of the district’s location is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
In addition, he experienced the efforts already undertaken to expand public passenger carriage during his train ride from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg.
"Remain hard and make sure public transport is better," he explained to the address of the local politicians present.
Experience a fun afternoon with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has invited the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cake, and then into a vesper.
Older citizens were previously hosted in the rast site.
This afternoon is held at St. Joseph's nursing house.
The homemen were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was worst salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich were talking with common melodies.
The over 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front delimitation of the old school court to the Kirchstraße before the rehabilitation is to be set once again with the rehabilitation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small angle wall was built in the first work of the renovation of the front school court, for stabilization and static discharge of the over one hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The further approach provides for Alexander Misok from the Bräunlinger Stadtbau Office to include the Landesmemorial Office in planning and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
Thereafter, a cost calculation will be made by professionals, which will then be placed on the table to the municipal council to decide and establish further action.
A decision on this is expected to fall in the next year.
After the renovation, planting and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, it is necessary to be renovated as a consequence measure, which requires renovation limiting walls to be renovated from the ground and placed on a new underground.
The historic, one hundred-year-old delimitation wall of the old school court to the churchstraße, is mainly due to water and frozen damages, as there is no drainage, needs repair and has a bow inclination forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, however, the wall is currently not at risk of crowding.
A resilient wall is a prerequisite for one of students to use school court, which has been done through the current fixing work.
Originally, school court repair was planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditures led to a shift.
An important word in the historical school wall renovation, which has already been used for film recordings, will talk to the National Memorial Office.
If specifications come from this page, the city of Bräunlingen hopes to be granted by the monumental protectors.
Students of the Bräunlinger Basic School, who are now taught again in a well-saned old school building with a new classroom, can soon use the old school court.
Özdemir wants to obtain jazzaus education in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions on the future of the music high schools in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now been on.
“I think it’s wrong to give up holistic education at the Stuttgart Music University,” Özdemir told the Stuttgarter News.
Jazz and classic are now at the jazz location of Stuttgart.
Özdemir, which in Stuttgart is considered a favourite for a direct mandate at the Bundestag election on 22 September, is contrary to the Green Red Government.
Based on a study of experts, this is forcing a rearrangement of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg.
Then, among other things, the Jazz and Pop graduate will be transferred from the Stuttgart Music High School to the Mannheim Music High School.
U.S. border: "Super Tunnel" discovered for drug trafficking
On the border between Mexico and the US, investigators have discovered and shut down a “super tunnel” for drug trafficking.
As the U.S. customs authorities reported, the more than 500 metres long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railways and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized.
According to the report, the tunnel has not yet been used.
“These cartels are stupid if they think they could be burned through the radar,” Laura Duffy, U.S. State Attorney General of Southern California, said at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where the end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Duffy said, “If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money.”
Both the U.S. authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Due to the complex equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The railway system was equipped so that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side is access in a building that is 80 metres from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters to the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimeters width.
He would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the Cocaine Found.
The third, a Mexican, was captured because of the conquered marihuana.
All three threaten as a maximum punishment of lifelong removal of freedom, officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, the press conference in San Diego said.
It was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.
Usually, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not by tunnels.
This shows the “despair” of drug bands whose traditional routes have been cut off now, Bill Sherman said from the DEA in San Diego.
They would do everything to get to the United States.
No details were announced to those arrested, at least one is Mexican, it said.
You have to expect detention penalties up to ten years.
2014 becomes Geisinger Festival
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of 1250.
Return of the first urgent mention is increasingly closer.
If the year ends in eight weeks, the anniversary will be held.
Geising and church houses were mentioned for the first time together.
A document was made in churches, in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15, there is an official beginning for the anniversary, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this beginning event takes place in the place where both were mentioned for the first time 1250 years ago, in church houses.
During the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen and in church houses.
Church houses will be held in 1250 in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Return to celebrate.
On Friday with a festivity, on Saturday and Sunday with a festivity around the Kirchthall.
On this weekend there is also the Church-Houser Churchfest.
City music director Rudolf Barth wrote an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be listed on three dates.
On June 21, along with the Black Forest Association’s Sunwend Feast, on July 12, in the arena with fireworks and on December 13, the first concert of city music in the new festhall.
This will be completed and opened in the anniversary year, the official date will be on the last weekend of September, on September 27 and 28.
On the occasion of the Geisinger city anniversary, a new chronicle is also launched.
“It is however to become a chronicle not only by Geisingen themselves, but a printed work on the geising of today, which consists just of Geisingen, church-houses, Leipfardingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen,” said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also today’s geising celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974 the today’s space was carried out with the income.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new festhall in Geisingen.
2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The Strahglonki starts on February 8 with a custom evening on the occasion of its 60-year-old existence, the Harmony Gutmadingen becomes 90 years old and has the fixed banquet on March 29 and then celebrates the District Music Festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Old Plant Leipfardingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10, the Music Association Polyhymnia Leipfardingen is 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the Fountain Festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was mentioned for the first time in a gift certificate owned by the Monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The document was manufactured in churches (houses), which was then court.
Both municipalities are thus mentioned in the same document.
The reason for 2014 to celebrate this 1250-year-old accordingly, additionally the municipal reform is still 40 years back.
Rat takes railway plants into the visor
Should the train transition "Am Hirschen" be renovated to increase road safety?
Yes, the municipal councils have decided.
Schiltach has to take 220 000 euros in hand for this.
The Deutsche Bahn will improve the Kinzigtal railway next year.
It is particularly intended to increase the safety of train transitions – there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles across the country.
If the municipalities vote to the reconstruction measures, they must participate in the costs with one-third, the rest will share train and covenant.
Schiltach's townmaster Roland Grieißhaber explained to the municipal council the characteristics of the bahn transition "Am Hirschen".
There the town plans to build an excavation at the height of the tunnel moon west of the railway.
There could also be larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwood, at the counter traffic without having to block the slides.
Grießisher therefore proposed to build a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could extend the subsequent road at any given time to ensure a smooth traffic flow.
This was discussed controversially in the municipal council, as some councils doubted the need for road spread: Thomas Kipp, with his statement, brought the mood of the critics to the point: "Do we need to take so much money in hand because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: the railway transit "Hirschen" is regularly used for longwood transportation.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partially transported through this track because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the track on the Häberlesbrücke because they could not be moving into the main road there.
Furthermore, the route serves as a redirect for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is locked, Haas argued.
Since it is not to be seen that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels should be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway transit "Am "Hirschen" could also give an important meaning of transport for a longer period.
The councils agreed to investigate what costs would cause the intended expansion of the road.
Notwithstanding this, the reconstruction of the train transition has been agreed mostly with the provision that the required support wall is built in such a way that the city can extend the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstraße" for encounter traffic to approximately 5.5 meters.
On the other hand, the reconstruction of the railway transition at the Gerberi Trautwein could lead to a completely different problem that affects access to the highly rising "Grouthäuser Way".
The administration had investigated the plans of the railways from the engineering office Breinlinger, as it had doubts whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhaus Weg was possible without any further.
The investigation found that it was not excluded that the inclination conditions of the road could lead to longer vehicles sitting on them.
The responsibility for this, in turn, bears the city as a street load carrier.
The reconstruction can result in liability disputes.
Since both the wood discharge and the bending worked in the current state of expansion, you should not agree to the rebuilding of the train transition, Haas argued.
Also at this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is significantly lower than at the other train transitions, because directly next to the stop point, to which a good view connection is located, is located.
Even trains from the main railway station would have to be braked at this point so far that no collision threatens.
Most of the railway transition has been refused to approve, as the city of Schiltach “should have to outbase the problem with seating vehicles,” the councils say, as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the construction work is completed.
It is unproblematic that the board considers the reconstructions at the railway transitions "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which crossing agreements have already been reached with the rail.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - Experts of the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects they want to launch in the coming years.
There were 30 suggestions to choose, five are still in the race.
Remote worlds.
More than 1,000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers.
Whether there are lives at least on some of them, no one knows.
The selection is hard: Do you want to look for gravitational waves?
Or do you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or going after earthly-like planets and thus, perhaps, discovering alien life?
These questions are the responsible for the European Space Agency Esa.
For their Cosmic Vision program, they are looking for ideas for two large space projects to advance research.
The state for such "L missions" is approximately one billion euros each.
The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were to debate, five of them have now come to the closer election.
Numerous bodies reviewed the proposals, hook up with the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision by the Scientific Programme Committee is to be drawn.
In total, four major questions have been selected by the Esa, which are intended to find answers to the missions of the Cosmic Vision program initiated in 2007.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The exact operations of the creation of stars from large gas clouds – and therefore also the creation of planets that surround these stars – are still in the proverbistic darkness.
A large infrared telescope in all could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
To address this question, in 2017, the space telescope "Cheops" is intended to be launched, with 500 already known planetary systems being examined in our close environment.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of €150 million.
With larger instruments, astronomers could imagine earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for biomarkers: gases that are considered an indicator of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question should also ultimately provide an indication of the conditions for the creation of life.
An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation from it with the planet system.
These processes can be exemplarily examined in our solar system.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa has already granted a mission of the M-Class (there the budget is approximately half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe is to launch in 2017 and monitor the surface and activity of the sun carefully.
Of great interest for the researchers are also Jupiter and his moons.
They want to figure out the role of the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
This is the first of three L missions of the Cosmic Vision program.
The Juice probe (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to start its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, she reached Jupiter and is intended to explore the atmosphere of the planet as well as the ice-moon Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The space offers many ways to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the natural laws we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead physicists to a new theory, under which all known natural laws can be united.
How is the universe created and what is it?
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos was created by the urknall.
In addition to the common matter of us, consisting of the stars, planets, and living beings like us, there is dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxies together, and dark energy through which the expansion of the universe accelerates.
Until now, researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first second breaking parts of the urknall, nor does it exist from what dark matter and dark energy.
With "Euclid" the Esa has already approved an M mission, which is scheduled to launch for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky, thus enabling conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
The best opportunities for an L-mission approval, according to many experts, has "E-Lisa", a challenging concept of detection of gravitational waves.
Among them, physicists understand changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven until today.
Elisa could do this, hope the scientists behind the project.
The mission provides a detector of two or three probes, which is stationed in the all.
In contrast to plants on Earth, it could also demonstrate gravitational waves that have emerged during the urknall, thus providing new insights on the creation of the cosmos.
Four other suggestions are still competing about the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called Athena, which is to explore black holes, Icy Planets, another mission to the outer planets of the Solar System, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet of the Finders",
Suggestions have already been excreted, among other things, for sampling return transport from Mars, for exploring the moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as for sun physics.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany in terms of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. intelligence service, said he is ready to travel to Berlin and to proclaim before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about their activities.
German deputy Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where this asylum was obtained to discuss with him the statement in Germany.
In a letter by Snowden presented to the media on Friday by Ströbele in Berlin, Snowden writes: “Even if the result of my efforts was proven positive, my government continues to treat a divergent opinion as a breach of loyalty and attempts to criminalize political opinion with punishment threat in which no defense is possible.”
Saying the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden wrote that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The U.S. Department of Justice’s accusation includes spying and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Time Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to enable that.”
The relationships between the United States and Germany are burdened by the allegations that the NSA has listened to the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the deputy who leads the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence, said that it should be taken the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness if this is possible to "not endanger him and completely ruin relations with the United States."
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
According to former NSA employee Snowden’s lawyer, Ströbele said he could not return to Russia if he leaves the country.
If Snowden states in Germany, he needs a guarantee that he is “secure” there, the deputy said.
In his letter, Snowden explains that he exposed himself to a “core and continuous” persecution campaign that had thrown him out of his home.
However, it is affected by the global response to “my act of political expression”.
Citizens around the world as well as high-level politicians – even in the United States – have called the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the public.
In his letter, Snowden made the German authorities an offer of cooperation, “when the difficulties around the humanitarian situation have been solved.”
Frontier Airlines charges hand luggage fees
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $100 of passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or limonade, even if it was in the Wednesday announcement that passengers are likely to keep the entire box.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage box above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier said it was calculated $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who only paid on the trail.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said the fee of $100 aims to move travellers, take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to calculate this sum,” she said.
In 2008, airlines began to charge fees for the first and second piece of baggage abandoned.
Therefore, passengers who tried to overcome them have stopped as much as possible into the hand luggage, which results in that the luggage boxes are often overfilled above the seat.
Fees are a way to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making money.
It’s about the most loyal customers of Frontier, who would have clearly expressed that it’s going to be increasingly difficult to find space in the seat above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets from the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger on the Frontier Flight Trail may be allowed to take a luggage piece free of charge, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable luggage piece.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before they arrived at the flight stop.
Frontier’s new hand luggage fee comes into force only in summer, there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often shake about luggage supplies and other fees, but airlines are happy to use it.
They argue that the transport of the luggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wish it.
Many at Wall Street consider the new luggage fees as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of losses.
Most, however, leave the fingers of hand luggage fees until now.
Three years ago, Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded the first hand luggage fees and later followed Allegiant Air, also a cheap flight.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, airline advisor Jay Sorensen said, who carefully followed the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand luggage fees Spirit would bring $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, has recently flew with spirit and was curious about what he would expect on the trail when passengers faced the company’s unusual hand luggage fee.
“The boarding process was one of the smoothest I’ve experienced in my career in aviation,” he said.
I was waiting to see teeth and hand-catching discussions on the flightstop.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding runs like smoked.”
Frontier also follows Spirit with the $2 required for coffee, tea, limonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who purchased limonade or juice should keep the entire box and coffee will be refilled free of charge.
Water is still free.
US Airways had attempted to demand money for refreshing drinks in 2008 shortly, but it turned back seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company had retracted.
Frontiers step to charge fees for hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative that customers are intended to be directed to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive to all companies to move passengers to directly purchase with them instead of via an online travel agency.
Frontier has, however, gone the most in this area.
In September, the company began to grant only half as many flight miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were again shortened to 25% of the flight route.
A flight trip booked by a third party with Frontier over 1000 miles will therefore only bring customers to 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve places exclusively when purchasing directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business slows down and the company loses money.
The revenue declined by 9% and the flight capacity declined by almost 13% in the first quarter, as read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the mother company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic has tried to manage the finances of Frontier as part of the company’s sales.
Proverbs come from the Bible
About 40 women visited the last women’s breakfast this year in the evangelical church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the municipal house were "Speechs from the Bible" and "Speechs from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the Church Council, took part in a lecture on the Bible proverbs after breakfast.
"Speech words contain life wisdoms, regulations or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible points and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs such as: Be watchful wood eye, like sparks fall from the eyes, throw an eye on someone whom the Lord gives His in sleep, wash His hands in innocence.
Several times the speaker also advised her listeners what proverb was.
The speeches from the Middle Ages accepted the church counselor Christel Dehner: All good things are three, making blue, somewhat running.
She explained the meaning and origin of the words that she called "bridges to the past".
Finally, a tombola was destroyed.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously rewritten before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round, Mayor Candidate Roman Waizenegger also mixed.
Learning instead of unemployed: Pilot project for unlearning in tourism
On the Mecklenburg Lake Platte, the pilot project was launched for the tourism industry.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as an unlearned in the industry will be qualified to be professionals for hotels and guest houses over the course of three winters.
“New is that the six-month courses will end with degrees,” said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg Working Agency.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the company would not have trained professionals who lacked increasingly in hotels and guest houses, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project is also involved in the Chamber of Industrial and Commerce in Neubrandenburg as well as the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA explains an “internal mistake” and not hackers are blamed for crash on the website
The shady National Security Agency declared late Friday that a mistake has destroyed its public website a few hours and not hackers, as online claimed.
“NSA.gov was not reachable tonight for a few hours because an internal error occurred during a planned update,” the agency explained in an email message.
The problem will be fixed tonight.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and that it is still not for some users.
A spokesman of the NSA had previously declared to ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the authority was “in no way” compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, the spokesman says.
At least a group of hacktivists claimed to have cracked the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website breaks down.
Cyber tactics are relatively simple and attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former supersecret NSA, whose spice name was No Such Agency (No such authority), is now in the bright light of the public and is exposed to the revelations of its extensive surveillance program published in the past few months – an outcome of the secret NSA data, which was stolen by the former snow-illusion NSA.
The growing controversy about intelligence carried out initial speculation that the incident today is the result of a targeted cyper operation.
The number of people without jobs fell easily by 22 in October to 1,307.
Although the quota with 3.1% was better than last year and also better than in September, “we would have hoped more, however,” says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy Officer of the Agency for Labour in Sonthofen.
Because many companies have responded to behaviour in settings so far.
One reason for this is, according to Felder-Bauer: “We have hardly professionals in craftsmanship, healthcare and old care.”
Since September, seasonally, employment offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry.
The winter season begins in mid-December.
The entire background report on this will be found in the Allgäuer Announcement sheet of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Loss of profit at Bombardier after decline in delivery numbers and orders
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc announced on Thursday a 15 percent decline in net gain after it was under pressure due to decreasing orders and deliveries on aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway party.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has also not published any flight test data for its brand new CSeries plane and has not issued any new information about whether the plane could go to commercial use in September following the ambitious schedule.
On the test plane's virgin flight a month and a half ago, only three other starts were followed until now, making it seem questionable whether the test phase runs as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a rate crash of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his rating from “outperform” to “sector perform” on Thursday in order to ensure that the share has a limited rate potential in the next one to two quarters.
“While weaker delivery numbers were largely expected on aircraft, but we are clearly disappointed with margin development in the transport sector,” Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program for the plane is moving forward.
If, however, no new orders will be announced in the coming months, then we expect the market to become more skeptic than the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was presented to the public in March and fled for the first time after months of delays in September.
However, so far, binding orders for the 177 CSeries have been moderate, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new nozzle aircraft are appropriate.
Currently there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Board Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet.
The company’s management also insured analysts and media on Thursday, the program lies in the schedule.
“The test aircraft has no longer stayed on the ground than expected,” Beaudoin said at a phone conference, adding that during the aircraft’s lifetime ground tests and software updates were set.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to make a first flight and then attach a revision period, which we have done.
This happens throughout the flight program.
The second out of five test planes is expected to launch in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, the company said.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical whether twelve months after the flight, the first customer can operate a CSeries aircraft.
Bombardier explained that it will check the planning for start-up (EIS) and update it over the next few months.
“The slow advance of the flight test – even though they obviously correspond to bombardiers in the internal planning – strengthens our view that the start of operation is moving to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter of the end of September 30, Bombardiers fell net profit to $147 million, or 8 cents per share of $172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share is 9 cents unchanged.
Sales dropped slightly and dropped from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a revenue of $4.56 billion, said Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world says he delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decline of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order in the Aerospace Party was $32.9 billion on 30 September and was unchanged compared to December 31.
“In the field of aerospace, the results were in the framework of our requirements, but the low income of orders and the overall market conditions were disappointing,” Beaudoin said.
Sales in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sphere has risen by almost eleven percent to $2.1 billion.
The order stock in the transportation part was $32.6 billion on 30 September and was therefore slightly increased compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the transport sector was impaired by problems of settlement in some major agreements.
According to corporate management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier share dropped 8.5 percent and rose to 4.83 Canadian dollars after it was also announced that Google’s Board of Finance Patrick Pichette will switch to the Board.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardiers’ closest rival, reported a ten percent decline in quarterly gain on Thursday.

Los Angeles LAX airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer warning Boss of Drugs from police investigation must be in prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced by the Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron from a large police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be discovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided sensitive information about investigations on his activities in drug trafficking after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The “first-class” criminal lawyer called “Bash” was arrested in his house in 2011 after police watched Scarborough whom he had represented in an earlier drug proceedings.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) delivering three bags of cocaine at the lawyer’s house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a meal at the lawyer’s chamber.
Investigations showed that Ditta regularly consumed class A drugs, after testing traces of cocaine were found in his hair, on his wallet, and on credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation on heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 others, they were later arrested after police secured heroin and cocaine in a number of house searches worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds in cash.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found to be guilty and sentenced at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week proceedings in two charges for disability of justice.
In a previous survey, he granted cocaine possession.
The lawyer was overtaken after the police found that in February 2011 he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw he went to Ditta’s house and put the drugs there with a 60 percent purity in a black golf glove under the lawyer’s waste tone.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly called Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park at dinner.
The lawyer returned home, took the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
In court it was known that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after testing drugs of Class A had been discovered in his hair, wallet, and on his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but disputed to take cocaine and said he spoke to the alleged dealer because he was his customer, and claimed that her discussion was under the "lawyers' secret".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he said he operates an office both under his private address and at work, and customers would call him at home for legal affairs.
In court it was known that he called important actors in drug trafficking, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and had informed what the investigators knew about them.
Attorney Anne Whyte said, “A criminal lawyer should be better than anyone else knowing that the law is not broken.”
Ditta is accused of the abuse of his position as a criminal defender because he has entered into too much with certain customers.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who provides drugs to his lawyer.
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate because he was the lawyer of these people.
But this went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between attorney and customer.
He countered the police investigation as far as possible so that they were able to continue to conduct their criminal activities.
Thus, Mr. Ditta brought his jobs in default.
He was too close to certain customers, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta said, “If I was a corrupt attorney what I am not, and wanted to share information with Scarborough, then I wouldn’t wait for 15 hours, but do it immediately.”
However, after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire police said, “Mr. Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment he began purchasing drugs from organized criminals.”
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him received for the motives of leading members of organized crime, who commissioned him to gain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public.
Ditta has deceived that confidence and tried to move behind the facade of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit led investigations against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and judicial impairment, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to court.
This case should be a warning for criminals and shows that no one can get away from the arm of the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring himself guilty of heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total penalty of 153 years for drug crimes.
On his website, Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job was to represent as a lawyer client in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality is the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of his 160-year-old existence, the singing crown Dunningen will be framed two worships with the "German Mass" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which enthusiastized the spectators in the spring of this year, the singing crown will enrich two worships with the performance of the German Mass by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this exceptional trade fair will be heard from 19 during the evening trade fair in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10.15 a.m. at the worship of St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Mass with the original title "Songs for the celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work of composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of the creation.
The fair is listed as part of the worships, as the contractor Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the Blätter Group of the Musikverein Glücksinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepsis leaves confidence
With the elections for the parish community in 2015, for example, the basic things in the Haslach Seal Care Unit (SE) will change.
There is only one joint parish council for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the agencies of Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
Because there is nothing to change in the basic decisions of the diocese and it is to the parish communities to implement them as satisfactoryly as possible.
Over the course of the day it became particularly clear: the sceptics towards the new does not hesitantly but seeing trust.
From the ideas and expectations of the news in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish board, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officers of the seat care team extended.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained the newly prepared guidelines for seal care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg on the basis of a presentation.
In the future, the SE Haslach as a church community forms a corporation of public law, which enters the rights and duties of the six individual church communities to date.
There will only be a joint parish council and a foundation council in which the parish force is represented office.
At least two elected members should be represented from each parish, in which the six parishes are formed so-called municipality teams on site.
Your task will be to promote church life in the place.
The question of the finances of the individual parish community then showed a significant need for discussion.
The news provides that accumulated balances remain attached to the parishes.
On the other hand, the liabilities go to the overall community.
Exactly in terms of the large investment planned, whose commitment then meets all parishes, there were great concerns.
“Even in the past, only invested in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone,” Haslach’s Chairman of the Commons, Bruno Prinzbach, related.
Practical experience with a joint board for five parishes, Barbar Knight, chairman of the board in the Schutterwald-Neuried seal care unit.
In 2006, they had made the task of "becoming one, five staying" and had to realize that this is not so easy.
The Bodies of the Haslacher Seal Care Unit then answered questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish board as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The preparations will be concretized at further meetings and decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the next spring.
At the end, Michael Schöner of Steinach presented the new logo of the Seal Care Unit, which was approved with a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, the current gets more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf must adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the director of the cityworks, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, a four-head Pfullendorf family costs 70 to 90 euros per year.
The essential reason for the upcoming price rise is the rise in the so-called EEG replacement from 5.277 cents to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This exchange is re-established every year in October by the four operators of the large electricity trails.
These measure the additional costs arising from the energy transition, which they can charge by a replacement above the electricity price.
The townworks of Pfullendorf are the last member of this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy company was even assumed in its forecasts of a higher revenue, reported by Jörg-Arne Bias.
Now, the concrete payments should be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price rise next week.
"We're going from an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, with the number being more close to the 2 cents.
Lamp on Permanent Red: Watch on Waiting Time
Sometimes a lamp simply doesn’t become green.
The contact loop in the road does not respond, or the light sign is defective.
What to do - driving with red?
If a person waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, Stuttgart’s lawyer Ralf Becker explains in the magazine “Motorrad”.
However, the waiting time must be "suitable", which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes before going out of a functional disturbance of the light.
However, whoever continues the ride despite red light, must be aware that he bears the full blame for an accident caused by this.
Anyone who patients less than five minutes may not wait long enough, Becker warns and refers to a decision by the Upper Court Hamm.
In the negotiated case, after about three minutes, a driver had ignored the light and had to be responsible for a negligent red light violation.
Indeed, the light was not defective, but later jumped on green.
A driving ban remained saved him because of the special situation - but the fine did not.
Municipality Board is pleased with solid budget
Whenever it comes to municipal council meetings about the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well.
The municipality sackl in Herdwangen-Schonach is well filled and the administration has no longer known debts since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be recorded as a full success in this sense.
This was clear when the 2012 annual account was introduced.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of approximately €7.6 million was higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget also amounts to approximately 1.8 million euros above the approach.
The excess is due primarily to higher commercial tax income and to the municipality share of income tax.
The asset budget was also clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the estimated 1.5 million euros, it amounted to 2.5 million euros last year.
“This is essentially due to the higher admission from the administrative budget,” said Rothmund.
Since fewer investments have been made than planned in the 2012 financial year, the addition of reservoirs has also increased.
Overall, the overall refund could be increased by approximately 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
“A work like this is not just shaking out of the sleeve,” Gerster praised with a view to the annual bill.
He and the church councils were clearly pleased with the good numbers.
It might sound paradox, but just these good figures could soon come to stand expensive.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality was able to renounce high lifts in the past.
According to Gerster, therefore, grants have been cut off from the country.
There are prerequisites for these subsidies from various compensation stages.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities that apply for grants must present certain lifting elements.
"We have to look at the topic of lifting elements, as in the coming years we would like to have subsidies to invest," Gerster said.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years
At the age of 60, Hubert Wermter’s history at the men’s song association Cécilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest, in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colors of his men's song association.
Even after sixty years, singing with the choir now probably still makes him greater fun.
Wermter was also active in the association, among other things as a member of the committee for 28 years.
For his commitment and association, he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Referent on behalf of the Cécilian Association Rottenburg-Stuttgart, given him - as the choir is also a church choir - a document of the association and a letter of honor signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singer colleagues gave him the certificate of the German choir association as well as a gravited tintler.
In addition to the honor, the 31st autumn festival was held in the usual trains: with the MGV Betra, the singing crown Salzstetten, the singing department Baisingen and the local music association, the Full Mariners had charged a colorful mix of various choirs and song styles, which entertained the visitors around 400.
The MGV Vollmarigen opened with atmospheric songs such as "In the Wine Paradise" and "Lustig, brothers".
Your singer Hubert Wermter prepared for honor a little still - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's song group Betra also sang classic choir songs like "Hanting advertising" by Julius Wengert, "Well, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you're going through the valley."
The song crown salt stetten provided with its mixed choir and women's group - the "impulse choir" - for the feast's women's rate.
The mixed choir kidnapped with the Napolian people's "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus into foreign countries, while the "Impulse Choir" also reached foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" belonged to their program.
The singer department of the Baisinger Sportsverein came back with "What is the Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" to homelands, where the Vollmaringer Musicverein offered the cronishing musical finish.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" also known as Hannelore Stollsteimer introduced a Kasperl theater and read a few stories that the children were well employed for lunch.
Children’s dreams become true
Children's gardens and kindergartens in the Zollernalbkreis will receive post these days.
The Black Forest Bote, in cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, wants to assist the facilities in the realization of their construction and beauty wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
Participate in the action, all children’s gardens, daycare facilities and child crystals from the entire Zoll Circle.
If you have a construction or beauty request for your facility, you can apply to the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action kindergarten building.
A jury, composed of representatives of Black Forest Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all sending.
What are the requirements for participation?
The desire should be achieved with construction material worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on an (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to ensure many struggling construction helpers.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and of course the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press annoyed controversial media law
“We are in a frightening situation and you can ask ourselves: what does the Parliament stop from simply eliminating judicial independence tomorrow?” was reading in the newspaper that considers the draft law inconstitutional.
“The law is draconic and very punishable and we refuse it,” said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, which also belongs to CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most prestigious independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be preconceived because it’s a prolonged arm of the government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we will appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government is taking the media effectively into a crackdown, but The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya had suffered a "heavy blow" and called the draft "draconic".
The adoption of the law is one of a number of measures to strengthen national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media pulled the anger of the authorities because they published pictures of security cameras on which it was to be seen as the units sent to the crime site allegedly stole the luxurious shopping center.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded to questioning with the order of two journalists and a leading media representative, even if the appeal was withdrawn after a media scream.
According to the new law, media houses can be deployed with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million, as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the possession of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “then a single punishment can press most radio stations into bankruptcy.”
Furthermore, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a destructive impact on those of their description according to “level blogosphere” of Kenya.
If they silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want unpunished.
“None will ever experience it,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation, who refers to Kenyan media as a decisive control factor in public life.
"Leaving politicians themselves, leaving the country into bankruptcy, and returning us to the time of hunters and collectors," he said.
In the past, Kenyan’s lawmakers have removed public trouble.
In May, they voted to revoke the cuts arranged by the National Remuneration Commission and put their low wages of approximately 532,000 tax-free shillings a month back into force – they are among the world’s highest.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream becomes true for the FC
The official opening party for the artistic grass-grass sports, despite the cold weather and rain, was nothing in the importance of the city and the football club.
A more pleasant hour of celebration had everyone wanted last Saturday, but Peter didn’t want to play with it.
So all those who came without umbrella had the sight, or couldn’t keep such one for any reason.
This was the musicians who framed the festival, just like some speakers.
Therefore, Nass was also the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks was most importantly Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and the association members who participated.
Here particularly Lothar Hero, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The arrogant pensioners moved 400 square meters of plaster stones for the new paths.
This remarkable volunteer commitment also appreciated Landtag Member Karl Rombach.
Other greeting words spoke to the urban sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the southern Bad Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation to the club’s youth department.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that repeated weather-related influences in spring and autumn were added to the original grassplatz so that he could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, there were the first considerations to solve the problem when it was thought of building a third place at the football club’s site or at the real school at the Salinsee.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts came up for the construction of an art-grass sports place, which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were introduced two years ago, when the FC took over the shabellube in heritage, a cost share of 100,000 euros for the construction of the square and the country approved funding of 104,000 euros.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to acquire the remaining 356 000 euros at the total cost of 560 000 euros, Klumpp summarised.
The beginning of the 68-fold 108-metre artificial grass square took place on June 4th.
During the over three months lasting construction phase, 3000 cubic meters of earth were dropped, half of which were used for the layout of a dirt bike track.
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations with the topics of internal affairs and justice.
To do this, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is direct democracy, delegation and the Federal Police.
In the morning, the Working Group also wanted to continue its discussions on migration and integration.
It is likely, among other things, to address the issue of double citizenship, in which both sides have opposite ideas.
The SPD wants to end the force for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double pass.
On the topic of traffic, which is not on the meeting order on Friday, the SPD underlined its no to a CSU-required car hire.
A vignette was a "flatrate for multipurpose and therefore ecologically contraproductive," SPD negotiating director Florian Pronold said in a letter to his group.
There was a threat to evasion traffic on land roads that are already accidental focus.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would also be a first step from Pronold’s view.
"There is a danger that the compensation for Germans will be removed later," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing wave on the outdoor light stage
Stuttgart - "When will summer again?" wasn't the question on Friday night on the Killesberg outdoors stage.
It was a tropical night in Stuttgart.
So the best requirements for Schlagster Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Drivers injured in accident
In an accident on Thursday night, a 37-year-old Aachen car driver was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old girl from Müsch was traveling to Grefrath at about 21.15 a.m. with her car on the Kempener outer ring.
When she wanted to move to the left to St. Tony's street, she saw the 37-year-old's incoming car.
The driving gauge collided.
The Aachener suffered severe injuries and had to be brought to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: blocking after accident at the scan circle
According to police, a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza on Thursday night, at around 20 p.m., on the left driving track of the two-track Reichenaustraße, rolled outside the city.
Shortly before the circulation at the Schänzle he noticed that he was on the left-wing track towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and moved to the right driving track.
This was a confrontation with the driving BMW of a 23-year-old constanter.
The VW Passat behind the BMW was also damaged by a 19-year-old.
A total of about 15,000 injuries occurred, police reported.
The road had to be locked during the accident recording, it said.
Vienna Airport Sets Passenger Calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
In the future, there will no longer be any transactions like this at Vienna-Schwechat airport.
Most of the speaker transmissions fall away - the noise level is to be reduced so significantly.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna, Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the adjustment of transactions affecting individuals.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai have already renounced noise calls.
Due to the dismissal of these transactions – an average of about 200 personal calls by the speakers on a day – it is expected to go quietly at the airport in the future.
“It has also been shown in the experience that these individual transactions were relatively little perceived, but at the same time all other information about changed flight climb or departure times is a little down here,” Kleemann said in a conversation with the radio station.
Highlander games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the braking car with tractors, there is a second competition at the autumn festival at the Coldenhof from 6th to 8th September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games start at 13:30.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are sweeping in Swabian at the Cold Hof.
Teams and individual fighters measure themselves in the disciplines of tree stam drawing, throwing and carrying water emmer.
The tree stem is four and a half meters long and 25 to 30 kilograms heavy.
“It doesn’t come to the width,” says the organizer Peter Saile.
The tribe must be thrown down perpendicularly, once overlap and then just go to bed.
This is assessed with most points.
The target accuracy depends on the throwing.
From eight meters away, it is thrown to a plot.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by the participants at the water carrier over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a bottish are measured at the end.
From each "clan" or team, two are allowed to participate in the single competition.
The winners of the team and single competition receive awards.
Training can be started at 10 a.m.
Desired is a suitable clothing, for example, the competitors can take on the Scottish rock.
But weakness is also allowed.
For the outfit, the jury awards a few bonus points.
You can register up to an hour before competition starts.
With the Scottish-Swift Highlander games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action is on Saturday.
In the evening, the musicians are at their cost.
At 19:00 a.m., the Schömberg Blasmusik designs the great entertainment evening.
The chapel plays fleet polls and marches.
Their repertoire also includes emotional rollers and a satier big band sound.
Heinz Koch, known as a singing host and blackwurstbaron, will be from the wealth among the corners.
In Dornhan, he has already occurred at the Christmas market and at the fools.
On Sunday, the music club holds Leinstetten for spring shopping, from 14:00 a.m. the Bauernkappelle Böffingen will be guest, and the "Oldies" will then make the festival sound.
On Friday, the stoppellacker party with DJ Ralf.
Other program points include Saturday and Sunday the Oldtimer and Tracker Meeting, exhibitions of companies on agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the mais labyrinth, the crafts market and the sheep shear.
Specially for children there is a sticky zoo, strawhupburg, tractor riding (under guidance) and tractor surfing.
Organizers are the multipurpose support club hall, the ski club and the tractor friends "Zeitzkapsel".
Milk and egg alternatives in overview
Vegan diet requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant sand is, for example, a quarker replacement.
The Vegetarian Federation is called World Vegan Day on 1 November.
The Vegetarian Federation of Germany suggests a number of vegan alternatives on the occasion of the World Vegan Day on 1 November:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, leaving yogurt replaced by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soybean, oat, almond or reism milk can be used.
Attachable plant seeds set up conventional hit seeds.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
For example, a half-pressed, mature banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple mousse or a tablespoon of ground lean seeds plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for it.
Lower teas are made instead of eggs, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon baking powder, a tablespoon food thickness and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soybean or silk tofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800,000 people are currently feeding vegans in Germany, which is purely plant.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the Schwarzwald Gymnasium students met the large American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it started to the Brooklyn Bridge, which was reached by foot to the heart of the city, Manhattan.
Here has already been offered a fascinating view of the world-renowned skyline, which is a special enthusiasm in the evening light.
Due to the time shift, the students were almost 24 hours on their legs, but truly the motto "The City doesn't sleep" was decided on the Times Square.
Despite shutdown, on the second day, the Statue of Freedom was reached by a ferry and cracked on foot.
Then it went through the financial center around the Wall Street to the memorial place of 11 September.
On the third day, students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating big city from the 373-metre high-platform of the Empire-State Building.
Afterwards, it went through the hectic roads of New York through the Rockefeller Center to the Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity to stay short in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, students have now arrived in their host families and experienced everyday school at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, on the day of St. Hubert's name, a Hubert's fair will be celebrated in St. Marien's Church at Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was, according to the Sage, a fairly unrespectful hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed the Bishop of Lüttich.
The Hunting Hornblazer group of the Hunting Third Westphalia, led by Brigitte Kluth, musicised on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood Es) according to ancient, originally French melodies.
The glasses wear riding clothes because they primarily accompany riders, horses and dogs musically on drag hunting.
The solemn trade fair will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed opt-up shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
According to Lexikon, it is called Déjà Vu a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In the event of visiting the same-named café at the oprail in the district of Kleve in view of the University of Rhein-Waal, it does not have to stay at the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the café with the beautiful name has the goal of making a real stay not only thoughtful, but handfest repeatedly experienced.
Because it's just fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into the inner life on the opt-out 8 gives the viewer a good feeling on anchor.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool café environment looks like a place to feel well.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top of the host with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
For this, there are delicious cakes or individually occupied fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already named themselves as gastronomers before the opening of the mushroom café at the oplap: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From moving to Kleve to the opposition, the sympathetic café lovers hope more audience.
Not least also through the university.
“While we don’t have a specific target audience,” said Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two young students here want to address just as seniors and all ages between them.
About coffee lovers.
The sympathetic owner couple stands behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot spray in the most varied variations themselves.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"For that a baguette - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were two events in the light café.
It's better to say one.
Because the port festival took place rather outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ring-sweatshirt evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's thing.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is not an express fan of event events: “You can’t do it right for everyone now.”
And with an event I always speak only to those who are interested in the special event.
This is why events will be the exception with us.
“We want to disrupt normal operation as little as possible.”
I mean, Déjà Vu stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful environment at the opslag in Kleve.
The road that becomes more and more a gastronomy mile.
For the pleasure of many adhesives, the guests from close to far, and the students who discover the gastronites and thus the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A Thanksgiving Day at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Foundation Festival invited the MGV Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were pleased to come.
At the clubs of the Witteborg restaurant in Dinker, all enjoyed the harmonious co-operation completely in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Festival is always the appropriate festivity to honor.
The special award "Singer of the Year" was pleased this time by writer Rolf Wagener.
“You have not only written a lot for us, you have also turned so many rounds for us, our hearty thank you for it,” said Erich Schlotmann, chairman of the choir.
This year, the awards for participation in the performances and choir samples by means of activity bouquets went to the Choir Director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert himself, and the last year’s “Singer of the Year” Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
Fifth place was held by Artur Brückner.
A particularly thankful board addressed the team of association wife Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again enchanted an extra-class menu and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets with its regular chore samples on Thursday at 19.45 a.m. in the club location.
"New singesfriendly voices are warmly welcome to us at all times," Schlotmann said.
UN announces new targets in combating poverty
The United Nations starts now with the development of a number of new goals to replace the millennium development goals to combat poverty, which have been announced twelve years ago.
Ahead of the UN Summit for Sustainable Development, which began the evening in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in the promotion of “sustainable development goals” to replace the 2015 Millennium Goals.
They were incorporated into the final draft document adopted by world political leaders, including Ms. Gillard, at the Summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on the night at the summit said it was time to “think beyond national interests.”
"I am happy that member states have agreed to initiate a process to agree with universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
“These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the development framework after 2015.
I will not be afraid to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals that are based on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even though the SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four days, the handball superiorists remains a good mood.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon has no doubt at all.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the thing.
I hope we will finally win again.
“Because I don’t know how such a victory tastes anymore,” Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-league reserve from Fredenbeck hasn’t pulled out trees yet, Malmon lifts the finger in advance warning.
Many players have trained myself in the A-youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their former coach.
"It is also necessary to wait to see if there is still reinforcement from the first one," the SG coach said.
In order to finally return to the success track, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the past events.
Especially in the coverage and switching game, it finally happened enormously.
Opportunity recovery must definitely be better.
Therefore, I hope my players finally got their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of conflicts between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of state and first president of Mozambique, to agree on a rare public demonstration of peace calls.
“We want peace again, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment company.
With fear about the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothing for a T-shirt with the title “We Request Security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the capital’s independence place.
For two weeks, there are almost daily reports on clashes between government forces and Renamo, one of the worst since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, which was initially supported by Rhodesia ruled by White and later by the apartment government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country’s independent government.
According to the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts think it’s unlikely that the country will return to a grown conflict, but recent events have disturbed foreign investors and locals.
The rapidly growing economy is a lot at stake, because the discovery of huge gas stocks off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring investments of over $50 billion in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US.
Since 1975, the ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent collision by attacking its members in Sofala province, a traditional high town of Renamos, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, Renamos spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to reduce concerns about an instability.
Against AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself as a “loser” who wants to “use all his remaining forces to prove that he can force his decisions to the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo gives up the 1992 peace agreement.
Against the FT, he said he had meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
“Our vision is to start negotiations again and seriously,” Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties have contributed little to the resolution of tensions fired by a number of collisions this year.
“We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collapse our minds here,” said Joseph Hanlon, professor at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good in negotiations and none is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, pushing for election reforms, has already explained that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to create concessions and financial advantages by the government.
Since 1992, a newer party, which was founded by a former Renamo member (MDM), will probably improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is once his second term ends next year – would destroy the country’s democracy.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up the presidential office," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but she has taken trouble-causing attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major North-South connection.
Most of the fights took place in the province of Sofala, located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, where Beira is located, the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio stopped the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga repeatedly answered the question of whether Renamo will repeat this threat.
“Renamo wanted to warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not good,” Mazanga said.
Instability has still increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already worried about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent kidnapping wave.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems,” he explains.
Omar Sultan, a demonstrator, said that people just wanted stability.
“None are interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they simply want peace and useful roads again,” he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “models for life,” an author says.
Thor’s stories showed that “brutal force has no chance against clever tricks,” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, are “too wild, too infamous, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools,” which is why Crossley-Holland pleaded for a “careful selection” of age-required works.
“I find it wonderful that myths and folklore in America are already part of education,” he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that with authors and teachers who are “overdidactic” children would “completely disconnect” because in fun stories the messages would be “intensively” conveyed.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Angelsash and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: “You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as possible.”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children lies in the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or led to the happy end, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subdifferently depicted, revealed through history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves to Freihof again
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob received his age retreat in Haslach, on Sunday his last years became alive at the "Freihof".
Many spectators were excited about the extremely short-scene play.
From the arrival of honorary citizenship to his death, scriptwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece that received a lot of gratitude under Cornelia people’s director.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker with the ten different scenes, explained relationships and overlap times from youth to near retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his childhood heaven, to his courtyard.
And then began the scene game, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his paraderoll as the great son of the city.
Stilecht he introduced Erich Becher from Mühlenbach with the two-spänner and "Black Forest Füchsen".
He was not only received by the audience with a lot of applause, but also his sister Philippine welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to get into the sister's role and gave her immense life in mimics and gestures.
Between the individual play scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected pieces of music and thus rounded the performance.
In order to award the honorary citizenship, Haslach's Mayor Heinz Winkler gave himself the honor, who made his waiting in the representation of the former officer Hättich along with a part of the City Council.
Their waiting was then made the three-king singers who caused Hansjakob to call: "Ah, as beautiful, youth memories will again be alive at my own three-king age."
With their song "O Jesulein" they enjoyed the audience in the Freihof as well as the Storchentag kids with their sound "Haus, Heraus".
His criticism to the official church had expressed Hansjakob at the time just as his concerns about the outbreaks in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization, or the effects of the war.
In the homeland, behind his tomb capelle on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his rest place.
“An unrelented mind had finally found his rest and had gone home forever,” it said at the end of the scene game.
There were many applauses and lots of praiseful words from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The Hope of Neckar Giants Grows
The opportunities for the league remains of the athleticly declined Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketballers have increased.
Because if there is a wild card procedure, then there is now a fewer competitor for the Neckar giants.
The Hamburg Towers Basketball project refrains from applying for a possible background.
“We’re not going to participate in the wildcard process,” said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been creating the concept of a professional club in Hansestadt since 2012.
A first breathing from Ludwigsburg was not heard.
"We didn't deal with the Wildcard procedure until it is not determined that Düsseldorf does not receive a license," said Neckar-Giant Boss Alexander Reil.
Until May 23, Ascender Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitration court and prove its economic Bundesliga suitability.
However, the Rhines have been denied the license twice.
The arbitration court is the last instance.
Haigerhoch: Evening church goes to the point of view
As a contribution of the city to the 150-year-old Existent of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the City’s Cultural and Tourism Office dedicates the last of its this year’s public tours on Sunday, 27 October, the Supper Church.
After visiting the nuclear cellar museum, the Haigerhole time is to be considered after 1850, when the Haigerhole came under Preussian rule.
Crown endpoint is a visit to the Evening Church.
There the leaders tell the story of the construction of the church and gain insight into the development of the evangelical community in a Catholic area.

Maps are available at the box of the nuclear cellar museum.
For questions and information, the tourism office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also testify in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could make statements in the U.S. business also in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Attorney General could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia.
This was reported by the agency Interfax, calling for unnamed circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be addressed intergovernmentally, it said.
Snowden’s departure from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted its source.
Because Germany is a U.S. ally, Snowden threatens the delivery there, Snowden said.
Long breath makes itself paid
Six men’s teams fought for the victory at the tennis tournament of the clubs.
In the end, the endurance of Team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of sportsfriends Rohrdorf for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun of the tennis game was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, each playing against each.
It was played in double mode with a long set up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament

After the movie there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles Piepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also strongly invested in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the halde.
The company has several irons in fire at the site.
In addition to the import of coal, Rhenus Midgard, among other things, puts on wind plant logistics.
Black shines the stone coal on the warehouse place in front of the deck.
Two huge blue half-sharing and rear charging devices distribute or charge the coal here as needed.
In each movement of the envelope equipment, a sharp warming noise sounds over the ground.
“The signals serve safety and are required by law,” says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, the wind is widely heard – and so there were already some complaints from people from the city’s north.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore gone into contact with those concerned, says the 40-year-old.
In close arrangements with the authorities, you are now about keeping the warning signals more silent with technical measures.
In the future, he will also engage in open dialogue with the neighbors.
Because Matthias Schrell has still a few things on the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on the importation of coal for power plants and is one of the largest sectors in Europe.
Thanks to the 18.5-metre-depth front terminal, Capesize bulk carriers can also be made here for a long time.
“This year we want to crack the 3 million-ton brand at the envelope,” Schrell said.
In addition to the Eon power plant, the import carbon goes to power plants in the internal country.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is still on the net, about 5 million tonnes of coal imports are realistic a year.
The three ship loaders on the bridge and the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bayern basketball optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague was not able to minimize enormous optimism in the Bayern Munich basketballers.
“No one can forbid us to believe in winning even against the best team in Europe of the past two years,” Svetislav Pesic, Bayern coach, reported on Thursday night at the title defender of Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
At their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first managed to turn a 15-point back 13 minutes before Piraeus turned the game again.
"We were incredibly back fighting the twice Euroleague champion, but then again made lightweight mistakes," Bayern professional Yassin Idbihi said.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful warriors of Munich who celebrated significant victories in the first two matches against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish champion Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conferencer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay’s innovation has been expanded, as was last at the New York Comedy Festival.
Started and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Caroline’s stand-up institution, this year the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“Most of these headlines began with Caroline and then became increasingly successful until they were known at some point to play in a club,” Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
At this year’s event there are performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as “Stand Up for Heroes”, an annual music and comedy benefit event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Billsby.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians who participate in the festival this year have become known more unconventional ways, such as broadcasting on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became famous with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-closing fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the occupation both at “Saturday Night Live” and “Parks and Recreation”, although she was the most famous for her viral video series “Marcel the Shell with Shoes On”.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic W. Kaumau Bell focused on race topics) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
Among the biggest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg speaks with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has become a prestigious television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he moderated a TV show titled “Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg” on TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s whole work,” Steinberg said.
He told me when he is here, then sometimes he walks through the street between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, then I may live here.
Iran is satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran shows a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN nuclear powers and Germany satisfied with the negotiation process.
“After years, we have a deal with the International Atomic Energy Authority to clear the differences of the late years,” foreign minister Mohammed Dshawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would still be a long way, but the nuclear chief entrepreneur is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that at the end both sides come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Kill Game Cameras With Machete
Two children in Uruguay admitted the murder of an 11-year-old.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go on bird hunting with them.
Machets and knives armed on Tuesday, they threw the 11-year-old and threw the body into a fountain, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Then they would have played football in a worker’s district in front of their homes.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the young man who had taken herself should say she was sexually attacked by the boy.
However, when the girl described the tathergang before the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elder named, among other things, a rivalry in the football game.
He was introduced to a psychiatric youth facility.
Container must be in prison
Because of exploitative human trafficking, retention, threat, insult and dangerous body injury, the Land Court of Constanz condemned a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorsteer after two operations in Afghanistan, declared a confession in a process agreement.
In five cases, he met women via internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the strip after a few weeks against their will.
He had resistance to break with violence and threats.
He retained the revenues of the women who acquired for him for some years.
Through confiscation of mobile phones and SIM cards, he interferes with women’s contacts to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who brought the women, he brought them to different bordellas in the southwest.
There he left them partly monitoring to control their revenues.
In court, the accused first claimed he suffered from a serious trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died next to him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert suggested great doubts about the psychological limitation and therefore of a limited debtability, the 33-year-old gave a comprehensive confession.
The court had to hear none of the damaged women.
A Kripo official reported that after a first display, at least four more cases of exploitation trafficking were able to be determined by telephone surveillance.
The heard talks were characterized by high aggression.
In later hearing, the injured confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness in which one of the women on the whole body had discovered blue spots has not made any statement until now.
It’s about “a completely broken personality” that violence and exploitation in this metaer look as normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
“He has removed from these circles and wants to live a normal life after detention,” he said.
Oil price continues to up to USD 96 per barrel
The oil price also continued to drop on Friday after worrying about a high offer overshadowed a report that China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference raw oil range for deliveries in December dropped by 14 cents at the New York Mercantile Exchange to USD 96.24 per barrel in late morning in Europe.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, meaning a price decrease of 5.8% in October.
The large raw oil offer has charged prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday the U.S. offer increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, the offer increased by 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday there were evidence of increased demand by two reports on increased activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This suggests a continued recovery of China’s economy, growing to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after it had reached the lowest in the previous quarter for two decades.
Raw oil from the Brent variety, a reference value for international raw oil, also used by U.S. refineries, fell at the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to USD 108.58 per barrel.
Court Blocks Decision on NYPD's Stop-and-Frisco Policy
A Federal Court of Appeal in the United States on Thursday blocked the order of a judge who had requested changes to the Stop-and-Frisk program (“Stop and Browse”) of the New York Police Department, and dismissed the judge from the case.
The Second Court of Appeal stated that the decisions by Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until the city's appeal was decided.
The judge had judged in August that the city violated the Constitution by the way the program for the sustainment and inquiry of persons was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the arranged corrective measures, including the decision to establish a supervisory body to assist the police in the amendment of their directive and the corresponding training programme.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the required suspension.
The appeal report declared that the judge must be released from the case because she infringed the Code of Behaviour for American judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly reasoned with a number of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge had judged police officers violated the citizen rights of tens of thousands of people because they improperly targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-risk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of substantial changes, including reforms in policies, training and service supervision, and ordered a pilot program with cameras carried the body in neighborhoods where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York declared ready to terminate the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were resigned after a police control.
An oral trial for the appeal of the city is scheduled after March 14, 2014.
Stop-and-Frisk tactics have been criticized by a number of citizen rights defenders.
Controls of this type have been in different forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls during the term of the unmarried mayor Michael Bloomberg increased to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of which black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men who belonged to all minorities were filed a complaint that developed into a collective complaint.
Advocates of changes to the NYPD’s stop-and-risk program say that changes will end unfair practices and create a more trusted and effective police and influence the way other police presidencies use the regulation.
Opponents are of the view that the changes would spare the morality of the police, but not the crime; even money would be wasted and the broader problem of a police that is under pressure after thousands of places were dismissed over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that she does not end the stop-and-freak practice that is constitutional, but only reforms the way of implementing the controls by the NYPD.
The Happiness of the Dreaming Camels
Happiness is an oasis that manages to reach only dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helfende Hands".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the club was celebrated, which can already have significant successes.
The first chairman Henne reported in detail the work of the association.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, another cooperation developed, and the gynaecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the actions were shown on a large canvas so that guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the mentioned actions.
The club’s desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Protection Vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now, according to Henne, plans to work in advisory function at the club.
In 2008, the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the nursing station in Socogim, a misery neighborhood on the edge of the capital, in a record period of almost one week.
Henne also mentioned a new Mother-Child-Hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is intended to be rationalized away in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, says Henne, for example, acceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political disturbances in the country, you could not make as many travels as planned, but for that many medical professionals came to Germany to hospitalize here in various areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, so in March this year medical devices, medications, association materials, hospital beds and glasses.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself supplied abundant local columns by telling of Mercedes vehicles rebuilt from Mauritania to the mobile goat stall and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians who traditionally support the club during their Mauritania trip.
As his personal motives, he called his work in the field of audit as a young Member.
When he became clear how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also emphasized that global economy also demands global love.
It should not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some people think.
It is not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson introduced phone hacking to check a tip
The former news of the Word publisher Andy Coulson allegedly introduced “telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” while attempting to confirm a false tip on an affair of the Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis QC told the court at Old Bailey, News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “attractive special advisor” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned Private Detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails, and tracked them, but Coulson also called her and left her news, as the court heard.
“According to the prosecutor’s view, Coulson, who is now publisher of the emergency, is no one who stands in front of people’s home and hopes to catch them on fresh deeds, but one who likes to face a story to see their reaction,” said Edis.
He said that NotW uses three procedures to investigatively investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, monitoring, otherwise it cannot be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He disputes this, but we say, "And if he knew it."
Rumors about a Clarkes affair were first taken up by NotW’s Feature Edition when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said, “Don’t waste your time, she’s along with Charles.”
A band with voicemails from her phone from at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaires apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
In the time the research was running, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls when they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of Pawlby’s movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: “I have a story that we want to publish tomorrow that I would like to talk about to Charles.”
Edis explained that Coulson’s activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett faced a matter with a married woman when he was himself bound to Rebekah Brooks who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks dispute to have vowed with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have added the phone hacking.
From protest against the planned rich tax, the French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
An arbitration meeting is endlessly.
In the conflict about the rich tax, the government and the professional football in France have manipulated themselves in a suckle road after a failed arbitration meeting.
On Thursday, President François Hollande received association and association representatives at the Paris Elysée Palace and heard their complaints.
But he refused to save the football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros a year, which all companies in the country should pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite remained hard too.
The strike announced for the end of November will also be passed through, the Chief Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, said.
The game days in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 set between 29 November and 2 December will thus fall off.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to engage the inhabitants in planning early," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizen information event for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants came to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures, ask questions, express concerns and introduce ideas.
Häußler said: "The final decisions make the members of the municipality council."
The flood, which hit Gechingen unprepared on May 15, 2009, was an impacting event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, Häußler said.
A river area investigation was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of aidlings, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
“The protection of as many built lands as possible is the goal,” Häußler said.
Based on the planning of protection against a statistically anticipated flood every 100 years, according to German Weather Service.
The climate change is taken into account by a 15 percent supplement.
In specialist circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water mass that led to significant damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1,000-year-old flood.
“There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement,” Häußler said.
In order to achieve HQ 100aClimate protection, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality able to estimate national grants of about 70%.
Heußler noted, however, that there is only the promotion if a general concept is implemented.
To this end, the community is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
A mandatory planning and approval procedure must be completed.
In the best case, implementation could be started in 2016.
Among other things, the protective concept, which has already been presented at the municipal council last week (we reported) provides for local measures in the flow of the liquid Irm from the Stemheim Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants used the opportunity to introduce their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no longer is planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, emphasized that it needs the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve in total the desired goal.
Furthermore, the most economical solution was to be found, says Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe.
There was disgrace in the highlands, who have always suffered from overloading the channel network even with normal storm rains.
The problem is known in the administration and first measures have already been taken.
Heußler, however, noted that the guidelines for channel systems are other than for flood protection and this cannot be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of regeneration events could be performed.
To dimension the wastewater channels larger would swallow millions.
Heavy-duty injured after collision
On the early Friday afternoon, on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf, two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collapse.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but could first say little about the accident.
However, there are several witnesses that should be evaluated first.
The 19-year-old VW Golf leader drives towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles rolled together, while the woman was so heavyly clamped that the firefighters needed almost half an hour to get them out of the vehicle wrack.
The actual cause of accident was unclear initially.
Both injuries came to nearby hospitals.
The route remained closed around two hours.
It could be called the US Dostoyevsky.
Philip K. Dick was a God searcher, a metaphysicist, his novels and narratives also have something serial.
Surprisingly, the relatives in the outside: the striking eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostoyevski and his massive Oeuvre as the founder and apologhet of the Russian soul can be understood, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet who is truly considered something in his own country.
Some titles have been published in the Heyne publisher, the Haffman’s cassette with the 118 narratives distributes two thousand ones.
Dick explains America - the empire of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, safety and the faith to be elected.
Dick had God’s experiences, his late books read like a mix of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain.
He realized early that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
This is the "Blade Runner" problem.
The killing.
A Master of Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minderness Report" dates from 1956, it spreads the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Court.
Here is developed the principle of “pre-crime”, “pre-crime”, which is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is terrifying to us, mutants look into the future - and the police attack.
“We capture individuals who have not violated any law,” says the head of the authority.
“We’re going to catch them before they can commit a violence crime.”
And, "There are no heavy criminals in our society, we have a penalty camp full of pesudover criminals." They read time flows.
They assume that bad things happen, and prevent the criminal thought from being implemented into action.
Dick’s narrative works like the blue pause for the anti-terror laws and the NSA’s abroad.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama’s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story is not over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no power division anymore, the military controls the daily life – and what remains from the state.
Then the supervisor himself will be monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system turns through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own prerequisites.
It takes errors and victims not only in purchase, but builds on it.
The system creates the danger that fights it.
Philip K. Dick says to come closer to the truth again and again.
Late Merkel in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could make statements in the US chancellor Angela Merkel also in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the German Federal Attorneys could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia, Interfax reported.
Previously, Mr. Hans-Christian Ströbele had met yesterday as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA revelations strengthen corporate paranoia due to government surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deeply over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany’s financial capital.
On the instruction of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism Combating (BVT), the German Internal Intelligence Service, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. external post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a speech change between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, said in September that the U.S. did not use opportunities for abroad to steal the operating secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profit.
But since Edward Snowden, who became a whistleblower, began publishing his filling horn on US surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the director in the word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency espioned the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and gained data from U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought paranoia to a new level for government monitoring.
The fashion to overturn brought to the disclosure that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone was washed, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can get into vision, then corporate management will certainly also be potential goals.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefits.
“Germany must wake up,” explains Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US now posed almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial spionage and data theft, a survey published in July by the consultant company EY.
However, there has been no evidence in the documents brought by Snowden that the U.S. has passed the operating secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU lacked certain IT and internet opportunities and should reduce their dependence on the US.
Companies are skeptical in this regard.
The Bundestag suggested that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“That doesn’t work,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn’t have left it out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything until the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the reach and technical refinement of U.S. spy agencies revealed by Snowden revelations have shocked companies that previously had seen the largest risk of spy in China.
In cloud computing, a major change takes place because European business managers are now more aware that data stored in the United States are subject to jurisdiction and are therefore potentially threatened.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, after the revelations about the U.S. data mining activities with Prism, about 10 percent of non-US members denied plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says, “We’re seeing a new question of customers who haven’t been there a year ago – it’s: Where’s my data being stored and you can guarantee that these physically remain in this legal room?”
Many German business leaders believe that recent reports simply confirm what they knew anyway that mighty states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore need to be kept at any price.
That economic spionage takes place is no surprise.
That's always the way.
“It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion,” said Kurt Bock, chairman of the BASF Chemistry Company.
The Americans spion us on a commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Corporate management usually does not boast about the countermeasures you have taken, because this gives attackers advantages.
In large companies, employees have long been blocked that taking a free USB stick on a trade fair or unwaken lieting a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberk, CEO member of Audi car manufacturer, says it has been a standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as a hearing equipment.
The German BVT advises managers to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, it is worried that small and medium-sized enterprises remain attackable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are worldwide market leaders in the respective niche.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect operating secrets from unauthorized access,” the BVT warns in a report.
The U.S. warns its own companies from economic spionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, U.S. National Intelligence Estimates in February, France, Russia and Israel were placed behind China in ranking two of the countries that served to purchase economic data of the hacking.
A member of the Board of Directors of a German blue chip company agreed when it comes to economic spionage, then “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French DCRL Internal Intelligence Service, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “Intelligence services know very accurately that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, will spy their allies.”
Hechingen: Fair gives answer to wedding questions
“Marriage is the most important discovery journey that man can make,” said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding celebration succeeded now gave a special trade fair in the domain in Hechingen.
There were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has kept in again.
This begins with wedding dress.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
The clothes often smell and stitching are closed at the front, often with a veil, on the rear they go down the back and often end in a slide.
However, the ghosts, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes, divorce from the fashion house Dressmüller.
For men, the suit dominates with vest and plastron, but it can also be selected cream-coloured or brown combinations.
The selection of the local is important, it has been explained.
Jewelryless side rooms are not optimal, the atmosphere should be especially.
Here the domain made attention to its own offer in the discount.
Whoever then wants to move forward with the coat, Uwe Link has an offer for him.
“But clothing is also popular for young people,” he says.
Romance is also required for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion comes the "after-wedding photo" - i.e. recording series in special places, preferably for example waterfalls, a few days after the feast, but in wedding clothes, said Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding panel, cakes and also a wizard, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
Don’t forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable party.
Dog Friends successfully
For the repeated time, the athletes of dogfriends Bitz were successful at a rally obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he earned 94 points in the beginner class and secured himself the fifth place, and with the 15 months old Marley he brought it to the twelfth place with 87 points.
Susi Höpp, with her Woody in Class 1, standed the critical eyes of the performance judge.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager whose body was found in a rolled Ringer mat in the gym of his high school are convinced that her son was murdered, the family’s lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a standing mat behind the tribune in the school tournament hall.
Lowndes County Sheriff’s investigation officials concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, however, doubting the 17-year-old’s family.
“They are convinced that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, Kenneth’s and Jacquelyn Johnson’s lawyer, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he died as the sheriff concluded.
“They believe that everyone doesn’t have a logic that violates the laws of physics as well as the healthy understanding,” Crump said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is worshipped to protect the person or persons who are responsible for the death of their son.
“His son went to school to learn and came back in the corpse bag,” he commented.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that there will be a formal investigation of Johnson’s death because a number of important questions are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore explained this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in which direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I represent the view that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy suggests that Johnson has died of the consequences of a "position-related suppression".
However, a second autopsy resulted in a different cause of death, Moore said.
“There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil law investigation of Johnson’s death, he will commission the FBI to carry out the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff’s authority was not ready to comment immediately on our request on Thursday.
A court in South Georgia ordered Wednesday that the authorities must release all surveillance videos reviewed by the investigators.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped that the video recordings contained indications of how he died.
CDC publishes allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for the treatment of food allergies from children to schools.
These are the first such guidelines the U.S. government has published as the number of children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States has food allergy.
According to CDC, the spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies in the teaching body and employees and how to deal with children that show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the auto-injection of the brand EpiPen is most commonly used – to encounter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Lawmakers in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep epinephrine easier in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms called children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something pushes on my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair is on it" or "My tongue crawls."
Parents of intersexual children can choose "gender indefinite"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is recognized for children born with non-specific genitals.
Newborns are no longer assigned to a rigid male or female.
According to the new law, parents no longer have to explain gender for such children, but can specify "undetermined" or "undetermined" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to make the pressure of parents so that they don’t have to make rapid decisions regarding surgeries for gender allocation in newborns, and to combat discrimination of intersexual people.
An intersexual person said years later, “I’m neither man nor woman.”
I’ll remain the flickwork created by doctors, stunned and full of scars.
An estimated one of 2,000 children is born neither as a boy nor as a girl every year.
They belong to the intersexual, a group that falls under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collection term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovarians or testos) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson was perhaps intersexual.
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States advise that you should use the best available information on gender allocation if a determination is not possible, and not waiting for the child’s psychological and physical development before you decide – if any – for surgery.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problems of gender identification, said the new German law “clind for a good thing.”
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but it doesn’t apply to most children,” he said.
One can make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait for how the identity develops.
The scientific data about how a child develops his gender identity are not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It’s like the secret why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersexual people are to be distinguished from transgender or transgender persons, because their status is not related to gender, but conditioned by their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both simultaneously or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in sub-range sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination that is exposed to intersexual and transgender persons in the occupational life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys not matching the gender image now have a special camp.
In the meantime, it is possible for adults in Australia and Nepal to indicate on official documents male, female or “third gender”.
In June, the Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world’s first “genderless” person after a court had granted lifelong retention of a “non-defined” gender status.
In addition to M and W, German identities will have a third allocation, X for intersexuals, says the Ministry of Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender topics are still controversial, a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition to remove the "gender theory" from school books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also spoken against German law, with the reasoning: “If the world is distorted into a new state where the gender is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we turn two further pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn baby from Maryland told baby zone that she would find it better if babies are assigned a gender at birth.
“Parent being is stressful enough, even without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the gender of your own child,” she told the parent site.
Children need stability and safety.
Historically, children who were born with both male and female gender parts were referred to as hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek God who had both genders.
Ten years ago, medicine considered the sex as something that could be erased and then rebuilded.
But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of a surgery are doubted after it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they don’t know how the child feels when growing up with the gender assigned by them.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When such a child was born, then not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The ruling theory about the treatment of children with unclear genitals derives from Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who depicted the view of gender being shaped.
He shaped the term “sex identity” and argued social and environmental-related assaults – as parents raised a child – interacted with a child’s genes and hormones and shaped whether a person was considered male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as John/Joan, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from a pasted circumcision to castrate the child completely and also remove his testimonials and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, but what it wasn't," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to male and married a woman.
At 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the entry of the Internet, survivors of these sexual operations have come to the public who are “not happy with the result.”
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY men's chromosomes, but two-speaking genitals.
The doctors were unclear whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never live a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So his external organ and tears were removed surgically shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
“I knew I was not a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should obtain a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressive and knew something was wrong, he requested his medical files.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilised at my birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he changed to male identity, received testosterone injections, and left his breasts away.
Through the surgery, he became infertile.
Today, he struggles for others in an organization called Interface Project to ensure that intersexual people are perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the California-based Law Group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law can "encourage to stamp and stigmatize".
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make fast decisions and assign the child a not-determined,” she said.
We fear that encourages interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female gender and then wait.
But we still don’t know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law, because “it allows adults to recognize as a third gender.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender,” she explained.
The German law is about the assignment of birth.
This is not a struggle to force small children at this time.
When you are grown up, you can decide yourself about your body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual difference disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law “represented” both parents and children.
Katie, Baratz’s daughter, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgenic resistance.
Due to the recipe of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and is married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatry employee.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to be able to give a child through adoption or a lender mother.
“The law gives parents space, which doesn’t have to make overwhelming decisions,” Baratz said.
It gives them the time to do different tests and clarify things and thus gives them time before they write “male” or “wife”.
In this way everything is okay – you get the child grown and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parent happiness.
And you don’t have to make a surgery that cannot be reversed.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear of parents' operation because they believe they wouldn't do the right thing," she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides about the gender that suits him better – and that’s wonderful.
This allows children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown girls hurt by shot out of car
Unknown people injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt at shots from a car.
The perpetrators had probably fired on Thursday evening in Genthin with an air pressure weapon to a group of children.
The police said that in the castle.
The girl was easily injured on the left wade.
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that passed a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disk broke down.
Then they left.
The criminal police reported Friday.
To date, the police inspection can look back at a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called to egg-off children twice, who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the egg remnants, there might not have been any harm in matters.
Furthermore, there are probably some Sylvesterböllers in the town area, but there is no harm in matters.
An inhabitant in the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with clopaper and removed his wheel blinds.
However, until the police arrived, the man found his wheelchairs in the immediate vicinity, all of which were why the police did not have to continue to work.
Living with future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives in a dreamful way.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with plenty of green, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and also not too much traffic.
In the city it is just a few minutes by public transport.
“I hope you’re not afraid of spiders?” asks Waltraud Ries and shows a fat spider at the door frame.
I’ve been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for a while.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the concern of being unable to deal with the many stairs to the house and in the apartment at age, she explains.
Also: Since a menisco operation, the fifty-year-old has had to experience his own body, what it means moving with handicap from floor to floor.
Recently, a book of her published on the topic 'Happy living in the age - Which residential form is the best for me?'
“Our apartment is the best example of what doesn’t go at age,” she starts to tell.
When she moved to the maisonette apartment with her husband over 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, with the middle of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
She also knows that she is one of the few people who are dealing with the topic 'Wohn at age'.
Most of them are putting it down as long as it goes.
“Old are always the others,” she says smugglingly.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really big, you think about it.
“Then it can be too late,” Ries said.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 residential models for self-determined living in age.
“What residential form you choose is always an individual decision,” she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even whoever can afford his age retreat in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he could also become ill.
And, 'Without good knowledge of the national language, you can also be united in Dolce Vita,' the specialist book writer is to consider volunteers of rehabilitation.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative residential forms or the often quoted pensioner WG.
At the age, everyone has his ticks and macks.
"For me it would be such a residential community, but nothing," she said with an eyewind.
Not even like in a student WG with a shared bathroom and kitchen.
“At age you just need your retreat rooms,” Ries said.
That a senior residential community can nevertheless work, the book writer does not want to exclude.
But this must be different from the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just want your rest,” she believes.
In this regard, she is at least not alone in the capital of the country.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as it goes,' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of citizen service life in the age of the capital of the country.
Their office advises people around the topic 'becoming older'.
That’s why just older people would often also take inconveniences and restrictions to be able to stay in their usual environment, which is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation.
There are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible today.
Ries recommends that anyone who works with the age-reconstruction of his or her home or apartment be thoroughly informed and not hiring the first craftsman.
Today, there are also specialists for age-reconstruction.
Even in the rental apartment, one or another can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat elevation, the interior designer clears.
But not always the existing apartment can be redefined at age and therefore barrier-free, even if it is so beautiful.
This experience had to be done by Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a staircase lift inside the apartment, which would also be paved with staircases to the apartment door but would be the much larger obstacle.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, it fears her more than before the spider at her home door.
US continues to prosecute Snowden
The US has not changed its attitude towards former US intelligence employee Edward Snowden.
He is still accused of sharing unauthorized secret information.
Therefore, he had to face a criminal proceedings in the U.S., U.S. Foreign Ministry spokesman Jennifer Psaki said in Washington.
Snowden’s recent statements would not change it either.
Previously, the German Green Politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow to not threaten him with punishment.
Psaki emphasized that the statements of Ströbeles are about the statements of a parliamentarian and not about the statements of a German government member.
Intelligence discoverer Edward Snowden is in principle ready to talk with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation.
This was clearly made by the former US-seek NSA employee in an unaddressed letter that the Green Politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and continued to head to the Federal Government, Bundestag and Bundesligan Attorney General.
The writing has the following words following a translation commonly distributed by streams:
To the Respondents
I was asked to write to you about your mass surveillance investigation.
My name was Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contractual or directly employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
During my employment in these institutions, I became a witness of systematic breaches of the law of my government, which led me to action from moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a serious and lasting hat that forced me to leave my family and home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted by the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance on my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also senior officials, including the United States, have judged the revelations of a system of overall surveillance that is not responsible for anyone as a service to the public.
These spy revelations brought many proposals on new laws and guidelines aimed at the formerly hidden abuse of public confidence.
The benefits for society from these insights became increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks taken were clearly decreased.
Although the result of my efforts was proven positive, my government continues to treat Disens as a breach of loyalty and seeks to criminalize and charge political opinion.
Nonetheless, pronouncement of truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the Government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will put off this substantial attitude.
I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are addressed, I will be able to participate in the responsible enlightenment of the facts on the statements made in the media, particularly in terms of the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I am looking forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is cleared and thank you for your efforts to preserve the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testifies by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Children's garden found a private buyer
“The building is in good hands,” says Mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden road has sold the municipality to a private person.
The municipal council agreed to the sale in its recent non-public meeting.
The building changed its owner at a "suitable" price.
“The community is satisfied,” said Maier.
In the budget, there were 100,000 euros.
It’s not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former childhood.
It is right to the mayor that Winterlingen gave the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and therefore no longer need to come up for the entertainment of the house, such as heating, looking at the garden and cleaning the walk.
“This effort is now gone,” Maier says.
Place concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach offers a place concert on the terrace of the Gasthaus Hammer.
As director Bianca Willmann lifts the taktstock at 19.30, the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of Hammrich musicians.
Chairman Manuela Honeck explains the music pieces.
Honeck thanked everyone who had helped successfully manage the first musician hock.
Obama’s campaign to replace Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisors have secretly thought of replacing Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign by Hillary Clinton, the New York Times said.
The revelation is the most noteworthy surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann’s long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times presents a copy of the soon appearing book, and she reported on Thursday night that the president’s top advisors would have held “wide group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011” to find out if Obama’s falling hope for reelection looks better if he drops Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, a national policy correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and the White House, notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on the survey values of exchanging former Foreign Minister Clinton to the Vice-President.
The potential change was a strictly maintained secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s closest advisors – including Daley, Obama’s former campaign leader, Jim Messina, and the former White House’s Chief Advisor, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the supposed change.
In "Double Down" it is claimed that Daley was at the lead of the efforts to exchange Biden despite her "narrow, personal relationship" before finally decided against such a chess train after the data showed that Clinton's candidate "Obama's chances would not be significantly improved".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government actually thought to replace Biden with Clinton.
“I expressed a whole series of things to be considered, and that was one of them,” Daley told the magazine.
We must remember that the President had terrible survey values at the time, so we thought, “For God’s will, what do we do?”
While Daley referred to the investigations as “offered care,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that during the campaign it had been operated to re-election significant efforts to find out whether such a train will pay off in terms of the voting urns.
“In campaigns, you don’t spend so much money on surveys and focus groups if you don’t think seriously about something,” Martin told AC360.
But it’s not clear if Obama knew his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley whether his boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley explained he didn’t believe the president was “conscious” of the possible change, the former chief of staff acknowledged it was “possible” that Obama knew it.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not give any definitive answer to the question of whether the political surveys had reached Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thinks Obama had nothing about the investigations about whether to let Biden be dropped in the elections.
“Possible,” Martin replied.
What happens on the way with my email?
Email is actually an electronic letter.
Has the e-mail was technically implemented in the drafting of the Internet service similar to the conventional post?
In the design of early Internet services, the main focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, in the basic technical protocols, it is not important to create a stable foundation for a hearing-proof letter change.
Therefore, a conventional email rather matches an open mail card than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two then directly connected?
In the first step, Anna's email program or browser will send the mail to the mail server of her service provider.
For example, if you have a GMail account, Google would be.
This email server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run through some other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Will traditional emails be reading through the network on their way?
Most emails are read multiple times by software robots on the road.
When the sender provider is usually checked whether the mail leads a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
Furthermore, the providers check whether it is a boring and undesirable spam mail that is deleted or at least removed into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their coming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do you read the e-mails with unknown people too?
The likelihood of unauthorized people to read an email is extremely low.
This is theoretically possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Law enforcement authorities and intelligence services also have legal ways to remove or take attention to emails.
This includes possible illegal action.
Is it possible to protect emails from reading?
With an encryption based on the OpenPGP standard, an email can be effectively encrypted against reading.
With a high technical effort, it is also possible to conceal the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it cannot even be detected without any further, who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
In the mainly privately used postal cases, Yahoo and Google, according to a August 2013 Convios Consulting survey, only play a lower role.
While the shares of Yahoo mail were last dropped, GMail was able to significantly increase from Google.
Mother in the forest and retired
When his old mother died, a man from Wolfsburg formed a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to cash their pension and care.
In order to continue to cash pension and care, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after police investigation in the forest.
First of all, he destroyed the death of the 89-year-old, then he destroyed the money for more than a year and a half.
The 67-year-old has to be responsible for fraud, as a spokesman said on Friday.
Therefore, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected in May: at the time he felt that no drugs were needed for the care-need mother.
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother was traveling to Spain.
Because this happened to the officials strangely, they continued to determine.
He found that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and he had last maintained them.
The 67-year-old eventually granted his mother's death.
According to police, an obduction did not have any indications of a capital crime.
Do you want ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first bright ice in the dark – with the help of Quallen.
Charlie Francis made use of the fluorescent properties of the sea animals and created a bright deliciousness.
The idea came to him after he read a research work on Quallen and was able to convince Chinese scientists to artificially produce the bright protein.
The ice cream responds when eating with the tongue, thus raising the pH in the protein and triggering the lighting.
Chris explains that the food ice reacts to the heat in the mouth and lights, so the more you leak, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company “Lick Me I’m Delicious,” says, “The product is incredible but still in a very early production phase, so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds.”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH rises and the ice shines.
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market at Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the lighting is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that it tastes delicious.
Charlie’s experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says, “I want to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is impossible for itself because of the light break caused by the ice cream crystals, which consists of ice cream; but I suspect we find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a cal, artificially manufactured by Chinese scientists
After six days, the TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball League.
Only now, Ingo Ehler’s team will come to the Derby tomorrow against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season begins again for us.
"I hope we will finally have our head free," Ehler behaves optimistic.
Finally, with the exception of the lasting injured Hendrik Blohme, he has his complete chair available.
Daverden also relies on speed games like us.
Therefore, we need to keep our error rate low.
First of all, however, it is necessary to increase in the cover, which last left everything other than a safe impression.
Daverden’s coach Thomas Panitz will be more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a home number.
But that’s why we’re not the favorite yet, because in the derby everything can always happen.
Nevertheless, Panitz is now looking forward in Morsum to launch a series.
There is a lack of Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this, the A-Young Joost Windsäuß, who is active with double-play law at the A-Young Bundesliga HC Bremen, celebrates his seasonal debut.
Anyone who is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was little, Halloween had something magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress for the neighborhood.
Today I have become the Halloween muffel.
In the last two years, I haven’t declared myself ready to distribute from my apartment sweets, and I’m probably not going to do it this year either.
According to statistics, I am a black sheep about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be accurate – celebrate Halloween this year, giving a total of $6.9 billion for sweets, costumes and decorations, the American Retailers’ Association (NRF) says.
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, exciting insurgent objects are the last scream.
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embodiment seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet that Daft Punk spacemen will create it into Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect it's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my wonder.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year for costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of “hot dogs”.
As for sweets, we're not cimper.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, says The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate beads, lutchers, bonbons and rubber beads.
So good news for the U.S. Trade Ministry, 41 million people, who draw through the neighborhoods with the saying “Sweet or Saures”.
In fact, we’re going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we don’t imagine – we’re going to eat.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is the sugar sweet Candy Corn; nevertheless, 15 million kilograms of it are sold for Halloween, the National Association of Sweetware Manufacturers says.
These are about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery that I couldn't solve yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses where it sparks.
They have great names such as “Terror Behind the Walls” (which, by the way, is in a real prison), “Howl-O-Scream” and “The House of Shock”.
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized houses in the United States that earn $500 million income, says America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you just pink into your pants and then put your friends on Facebook where you don’t get them out again, and then the guy on which you stand leaves a comment like “neat face pressure.”
Let's finally come to the cuts.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Big Cup when we were children, and the snipping of a cup lamp is like the decoration of the Christmas tree – something we’ve made up from a little time.
Fortunately, the “baby in the curry” trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up to cut the curry and not to sit there.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million for cut, the US Census Bureau says.
The cucumber lantern, slowly destroyed in the front garden, is probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of cucumbers were harvested this year.
If you want to point right, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and remove some beautiful from their 921-kilo heavy pumpkin.
Home Fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue Forces bear boiled corpse
The firefighters had to express themselves in Helmbrechts late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire in the night to Friday.
The rescue forces got a boiled body out of the house.
Rescue forces have found a boiled body in a three-family house at a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it was unclear about an inhabitant, a spokesman of the police in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday night it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the firefighters arrived, the flames already shot out of a window.
The forces went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room were completely burned out.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other inhabitants were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman said.
The building is now no longer inhabitable.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany’s largest national church has started an offensive to advertise for the profession of the pastor.
Background is a possible lack of priests: the Evangelical-Lutheran National Church of Hannover expects that the number of its currently 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030.
For young people of today, the profession is very attractive and offers good future prospects, Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) said in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to determine the work and day run itself.
With Burfien, for the first time the Landes church has commissioned a pastor in a full position to enthusiast young people for theology.
Currently, less and less young people choose to study theology after the abitur.
Burfien says, “God’s voice is silent, the world is loud.”
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the lord of my date calendar and I can put my focus on where it is important to me.
Pastors could be close to people as a seal caregiver.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well.
The free economy will certainly be paid more, but theologians would have a safe employer for that.
This comes to meet the young people of today, who are not only about career, but about a sinner-filled work.
According to the National Church, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently retired a year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology graduate begin their vicaria.
In thinly populated border areas such as resin, Emsland or Wendland, it could be difficult to occupy jobs in the future.
Burfien, among other things, wants to organize studies days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The theology degree offers a broad education.
This means that you can even become federal president.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point patterns as well as a free-speaking facility.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from Bowler Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains, “The rally customers coming to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racers, but people looking for excitement and adventures, as well as an accessible path to world-class events.
We are happy to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that the format creates new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare new people for the straps and reality of Rally Raid.
We really had fun developing the Defender Challenge wagers – this will be a fun championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will have a training and test day in February as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire fighters called to rescue a dog that sat 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock lead in a stone break
Cockerspaniel-Hundin Ruby escaped after a smaller road accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in a stone break in her missing position.
Firemen rushed on the rock wall and saved the dog from safe death
The firefighter managed to safely put a dog in a rock wall on a 15-metre tall leap.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel-Hundin Ruby was running after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was saved from a stone break on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, who belonged to the dog, came to the stone break Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to take Ruby back and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing dog and published help calls on social networks when she had escaped into the stone break after the small traffic accident.
On Wednesday, about 14:15 a.m., a walker running his dog saw Ruby beaten on the 15-metre-high section in stone break.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed towards the rescue of Rubys, which was then transported up into a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue team specialist, said, “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from above and from the ground.
She didn’t move any muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate a few dog cakes.
That was a pretty unusual commitment.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a technical rescue team specialist, said, “Ruby had a huge happiness.”
There was a possibility that she was very severely hurt or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian for examination, but none found, except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “Seeing at the rescue was frightening.”
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her back in the arms.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion became too large and it had collapsed, it would probably be collapsed.
The firefighters have done great things.
It was really courageous what they did.
We are just so grateful and everyone of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added, “We were afraid she would fall down, but she remained upstairs.”
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explained he never started Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop-star said she worked as a background singer at Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she ate with the Altrocker at dinner, and that “he digged me when I was 18.”
She added, “That’s been a long time ago and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a representative of Jagger, 70, said on Thursday that he “categorically denied that he ever made attempts to approach Katy Perry.”
The representative added: “Perhaps she confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Their new album “Prism” landed on the first place this week.
George Kerevan: European deflection gives Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is necessary to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border secured with stack wire along the Hadrianswall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde template pointed out the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but, as expected, this did not play any importance in the headlines.
No one has also mentioned that EU member states often comply with their strict rules if it is more favorable to them.
Since Scotland is currently not of the Schengen area, continued non-respect for Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what one really wants from the Scots.
So actually not a story.
And one that has come so much in the years that it is already similar to a fossil: the first time I heard the “independence means passport controls” enter at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in continuous repetition of this ancient story.
Why should an independent Scotland expect it to dance after the European pipe?
Why do we exchange the London yoke for the Brussels yoke, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for the unification of Europe after the war has fallen into stoke.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
Wherever in the EU, parties who are EU-hostil or wish to throw the euro on board as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Party Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – was able to earn almost five million votes at the Bundestag election in September and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis turns out as a turning point.
Because of the strict savings policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the compulsory jacket that forces the respective national economy by holding the joint currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – that was the case only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has fixed its members on exchange rates that are advantageous for German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave that.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe has a built-in disadvantage of productivity compared to Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public expenditures – inspired by Berlin.
Behind the current state and currency problems there is a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the “green” energy directives prescribed by Brussels – a code for the subsidizing of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays double for electricity compared to the United States and four times for gas.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we could see in Grangemouth.
All wages in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American sliding gas.
As a result, a revolt is rising, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, France’s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which Germany could be held in chess and lifted Paris up with Washington.
However, Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has pushed Europe on its own economic policy, with which the attacked French economy has to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pens’ right-oriented, EU-hostil Front National has just won a decisive re-election, thus referring the ruling socialists to the third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of voters – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean advantages for the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly gained popularity among the white French worker class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to form an anti-EU, anti-community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties cut well in these elections – and this is very well possible – then such a block could for the first time dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to beyond: in the not too far further future, the growing resentment against the EU and the joint currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be more like the "Europe of (sovereign) nations" that General de Gaulle favoured.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may keep the euro fixed, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance from this project in the hope of engaging in the United States.
However, Washington’s increasing interest in the Pacific area suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (last consequence) Small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, including saying Berlin and Brussels, where they can stand.
I suspect that Scotland could drive well in a locker European association, provided we retain our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar thinking countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should consider making it equal to Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is the most successful political movement against savings policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the denial of the proposed (and made) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the following Tory-Lib Dem Coalition had responded.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to now choose an independence only to then get a savings policy forced from Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Faster Growing
African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age girls, as research shows.
Physical changes are not immediately puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend to early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children’s health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter already grows breasts and shame hairs at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Association this week in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric endokrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz said these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time calming parents – usually that’s not a sign of puberty happening quickly,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious advertisements of development, such as growing breasts, shame and axis, as well as body smell, appear earlier in girls.
Nevertheless, there was only a slight displacement in the age of the Menarche (first regulatory bleeding occurrence) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“When breast development begins, it takes at least two to three years before the Menarche,” said Kaplowitz, also author of the book “Early puberty in girls: the essential advisor to address this commonly occurring problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial, which actually represents the beginning of puberty, but it applies to "moving" when the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost before an age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can monitor carefully.
In faster advancement, tests could be displayed by an endichronolog so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and defense of another consequence: the premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth barrier and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the child’s age, development speed, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is retaining with regard to medications, but he acknowledges: “Suppressing puberty can mild the behavioral problems and feelings of girls, unlike their ages.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They're worried about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygiene side," Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter aged ten of her days.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home frightened and excited from school because she was the first in her friend circle.
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be caused.
Boys come to puberty similar to girls earlier.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported conducting a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine, which creates a connection between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other research supports this conclusion, but there are many other factors playing a role.
In this country, African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age girls.
There are different explanations for this.
Global seems to have an early puberty affected by all things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys are growing in the face and shame hair before, the trend to a completely premature puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and shame hair is common even in babies and young children.
“We must be careful to identify the true beginning of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endokrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to leave advice from their childhood doctor how to talk to their child.
“This may mean you have to have a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz added.
When you stay quiet, the child usually responds well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it comes earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders over seat width
Leading aircraft manufacturers have come to a discussion about the width of seats in the tourist class in long-distance flights, indicating the sound for a bitter collision at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is around the seat width that passengers are offered on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who strive most to airlines, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
Airbus calls for a industry standard this week, which prescribes a seat width of at least 46 inches (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the U.S. Boeing’s rivals say that airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete for selling even larger versions of their two-engine long-distance flights, and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
As the rear part of the plane is designed – especially whether there are nine or ten seats rows – is crucial for the specified economic results that the new mini-jumbo design is designed.
Boeing claims its modernized “777X” makes 406 people in the tourist class sitting over 17 inches wide, allowing 10 per row.
Airbus explains that the competitive version of the A350 carried 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft gigants often share heat over technical details by advertising in the press.
Now Airbus appeals to the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with more than 100 orders is expected to race directly to the public.
The company recently presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war and showed a picture of three people sitting together in a restaurant, and the title: “Will you accept this?”
“Boeing suggests long-distance flights in seats that are narrower than regional turbo-props,” said Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
In view of changed nutritional habits, people become thicker, but plane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to data from the U.S. Health Ministry.
The waist range of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says his rival stands on a seat concept from the 1950s when the average body range of the freshly baptized “Jet Set” was narrower.
Airbus said that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat has increased sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing denies Airbus' numbers to the seat size and says it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines to shape the balance between air fares and facilities.
The company also explains, according to investigations, the experience in the aircraft is more than the seat width.
“It’s really going on to give airlines flexibility so they can do what they think they need to succeed,” Boeing’s flight cabin expert Kent Craver explains.
They don’t want us to dictate what makes them profitable.
You know your business better than anyone else.
For passengers it is about more arc freedom, but for manufacturers it will be increasingly a topic that can affect revenues.
Behind the struggle is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion based on list prices in the coming decades, which could have a sustainable impact on the U.S. or Europe’s export balance sheet.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the fighting about the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20% more efficiency per seat on their latest two-engine long-distance designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing’s statements about the results are partly dependent on the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
Increased costs per unit are still lower than for currently used machines with ten seats per row.
“Boeing is therefore getting more seats in its plane to make it more competitive to our products,” says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analytics, full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s suggested that many passengers decided for the closer arrangement, which could be associated with cheaper air fares.
“Twenty-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777,” says Mary Kirby, cabin facility expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Worldwide traveling jet sellers even carry band size to reduce the facility in competition.
Even if they offer comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but has not sold yet, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offering broad seats on the corridors for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard would probably be pupped, but could distract the 777X sales wave.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make fun smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotin vaccine that could destroy the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before human tests, further experiments are needed, which may still take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and try all the methods available on the market, but have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, so a smoker does not experience nicotine-high.
Mice vaccinated with nicotine administered attempts kept their normal level of activity.
On the other hand, mice without vaccination would have taken a “outtime,” the researchers explained a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so frequently to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and unpractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is probably significantly lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine could be given to people if he is sure to be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But more likely is that smokers would use him to stop.
“Then you know that when you start smoking again, you no longer feel pleasure in it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps you to get the habit out,” he explains.
British scientists said the results are interesting, but at the same time warned that further research is still necessary.
Tripodi denied being influenced by Obeid
The former minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is launching an investigation by the government’s corruption supervision.
The former NSW minister disputed that he had changed the provisions for maritime adherence at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned hidden stakeholderships in three lands in government-controlled country.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission Against Corruption) expanded its investigations on Friday on whether Obeid influenced several state ministers in this regard, passenger agreements at the Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without tender after their expiration in August 2005.
Now, because of the accusation, Tripodi was aware of Obeid’s hidden interest in the lands, after Tripodi’s former deputy Chief of Staff Lynne Ashpole on Thursday.
In years of talks, which began in 2005, the government had urged public tenders for the cash agreements.
The guards were opposed and also wanted longer duration.
In 2009, the cash agreements for the companies at the Circular Quay, which incurred $2.5 million annually to the obeids, were extended without public tender.
Tripodi, who was port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally voted for public tenders.
However, he refused to make the changes at Obeid’s requests, which, as Tripodi confirmed, had urged to reshape the government’s commitment rules.
One of the ICAC’s submissions showed conversations from August to September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who was moved to the Harbour Ministry after working under obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
“What was the issue discussed in these telephone talks about the development of commercial payment arrangements?” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“No,” answered Tripodi.
I can’t remember what was discussed, but that was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter aircraft attack targets in Syria, official sources say
Israeli hunting planes had attacked a destination in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government employee confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
Israel has carried out at least twice airstrikes on missile deliveries in Syria this year.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to "authenticity test"
The Government is considering an authenticity test for foreign workers with 457 visas as part of expanded measures.
If the test is launched, it would be used through a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to occupy unskilled jobs or as a back door for the admission of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after former Laboratory Party deputies, Maxine McKew, condemned the government’s comments on foreign workers because they could be taken as an insult by Australia’s neighbors.
“Full explanations such as ‘foreigners should stand behind’ and ‘Australians should first hire’ are a very unpleasant return in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, that means white workers should be protected – and if some in the region echoed this historical artefact, I wouldn’t wonder.
The discussion proposal is about twelve measures, once considered by the former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration minister Brendan O'Connor, who had talked about human trafficking in Sri Lanka yesterday, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still considered.
If the “authenticity criterion” is taken, someone who applies for a visa may be verified whether the application is genuine in the cases where the applicant is related to or personally associated with the owner or relevant person of the supporting company.
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders after in the past, companies who initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri-Lankian asylum probably died of a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him, has been taken care of since his father died on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The British government announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to achieve high-speed connections between Scotland and Northern England with the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, said the project “will bring Britain closer together.”
Keith Brown, Minister of Transport, said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated costs for the construction of the high-speed road between London and North England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to search for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a trip time of ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said, “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together.”
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings huge advantages.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our railway network.
However, it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael said: “Today’s announcement is a good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown urged Carmichael to engage "uncomprehensively" for the inclusion of Scottish in the HS2 network.
Brown said, “The high-speed rail connection has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time the economic power of Scotland provides an argument for fast rail connections throughout the UK.”
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British government and to investigate the options for a high-speed train connection in Scotland, creating the benefits for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh connection that the Scottish government already plans.
I am looking forward to reviewing the investigation report with the British ministers next year and jointly deciding on the next steps.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force in Australia provisionally
Australian flight passengers must continue to shut off tablets and smartphones at start and landing, despite efforts in the US to remove the regulations for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read, watch or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in the Flight Mode.
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed, but many people find it upset that they are not allowed to read their e-books when starting and landing.
Australian companies observe the decision to implement the U.S. airlines have to do a lot of work but do not pursue direct plans to amend their rules.
CASA also said it would be considered the announcement, but emphasized that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia continue to apply.
“The CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft,” he said.
The subject is subject to provisions in which airlines must maintain the safety at any time and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by the cabin personnel.
Virgin has already conducted talks with CASA about an expansion of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and declared that you are open to changes, but that they should be initiated by the legislator.
“We would welcome a review of CASA’s electronic equipment approval because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight,” a spokesman said.
Qantas explained that the current rules will be kept up until further.
“Our current guidelines provide that electronic devices cannot be used when launching and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that,” the company said.
The FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in arrangements that passengers can benefit from, and will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision is different in US societies depending on age of the fleet.
You must demonstrate that your aircraft can tolerate radio disorders through mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs, as well as customer instruction.
“Once a airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any level,” the FAA said.
In rare cases in poor view, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off the devices during the landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be stored safely under the seat or in the areas above the seats when starting and landing.
Before the revolution against Schalke, the BVB trailer with lighting rockets had been taken care of for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced tough consequences.
Before the Friday match of the Football Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted silently - first.
It was an unusual, almost already ghostly acoustic, which offered to the viewer until shortly before the Bundesliga match between German vice-master Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in Signal Iduna Park.
The guest fans were mostly listening to with their songs.
In contrast, the southern tribune, where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, first presented itself exceptionally quietly: no songs, no battle calls.
The Podest of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint fire, remained unoccupied.
And on the front of the tribune alone, a big flag with the title "Section Stadium Prohibition".
Only as a gate guard novel Weidenfeller, as always the first BVB player entered the place, marked short-term joy.
When his teammates followed, there were loud songs and mourning scars - but not everywhere long.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern tribune, nothing rebuked.
Also that stadium speakers Norbert Dickel once again counted the positive experiences of the last days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, extension of contract by trainer Jürgen Klopp, did not make a celebration.
Only five minutes before the capo's pitch clothes his podest - and the tension that until then was straightly tapped with the hands until then unleashed in a loud scream, as dickel asked the mood at the range of the stadium as usual.
Lastly, the southern tribune was on the row, as always - and finally, here again, as usual, was the most noisy place in the stadium.
And at the latest as the southern tribune's loud call "Derby winner stands up" came, everything was again as usual.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the happenings of the past days.
Immediately before revolution at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB trailers had fired light rockets into the spectator edges and on the square – and almost gateguards Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke then received the tops of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and one believes Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultramovement," the BVB Boss announced on Thursday night at a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned Ultras from choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
“I’ve forbidden that,” he said.
We cannot give up zero tolerance policy regarding pyrotechnology.
In addition, the Ultras have been shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to choose one.
Otherwise, Watzke says, the BVB will set a sanction by the end of the next week.
"That's going to be incredible," Watzke said.
You can look forward to how the reactions on the southern tribune then occur.
Paddle houses boom in Singapore as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
Janani Amirthalinga is replacing a golden armrests, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters.
“My husband and I just bought a house, and all my money is in it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars each month (about 1,730 euros) as a administration employee and her husband also works, she does not explain the monthly family income.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where the debt of the households is increasing – is so great that ValueMax, where it made its exchange, became this week the third counterpart listed on the Singapore exchange.
Jewelry is not only a faster way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, paddle houses in Singapore demand an effective annual interest of 17 percent, little above the 15.4 percent that the United Overseas Bank demands, a local lender with a store at the same shopping center.
However, panels offer the advantage that there is no creditworthiness check or income evidence required, which is why loans are faster than possible for banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to pantry houses after families feel the pressure of increasing costs of living as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans in developed economic areas, families with lower and medium-income are looking for houses to compensate for the difference in lower economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor’s growing household debt, mainly due to increasing mortgages, referred to as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, according to the agency, have the highest budgetary debt in Asia in relation to the gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80% of GDP, an increase of 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed an ongoing export weakness and a decrease in consumer demand.
“In the end, this means that in view of increasing costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highlights in gold prices over the past two years have reinforced the trend to repair personal items as people use the opportunity to turn the family’s jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, approximately 70% of the items are gold in the city’s 200 houses.
People say, “The gold price looks good, let’s get Grandmother’s gold chain and get back next month.”
The largest Thai farmhouse operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20 percent customer growth in its stores in recent months.
The growth in the paid business is so strong that ValueMax, operating in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company funds it with 60% of the 66 million Singapore dollars, which it took this week with the exchange in Singapore.
While some lenders have fallen into cross-fire due to high interest rates, Yeah explains that panking houses are not only making favourable interest rates than other lenders, but also not directly raising the debt.
“Customers borrow items that they already possess, and the liquidation of personal value items does not enlarge the household education,” she explains.
The loan business is socially increasingly accepted as short-term, secured funding.
Also, not all people who use loans are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax’s stores to carry gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they get up to 60% of the purchase price in cash.
Customers come to us from every social layer.
“This includes wealthy people who lend something for a business or an investment in the short term, or small businesses who have to overcrowd cash flow gaps,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The intelligence discoverer Edward Snowden has a principle of interest in helping Germany to enlighten the increasingly broader NSA hazards.
According to the presentation of the Green Bundesdag deputy Hans-Christian Ströbele, during his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia, it was about what conditions the former intelligence officials would declare at a German prosecutor’s office or before an investigation committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian government consists of the hard conditions linked to the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare to ensure that the state’s government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth will take “inexpected measures” to avoid a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
Funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian member Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has set up an emergency rescue package that we believe is addressing the unique challenges faced by the state,” said Plibersek today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million emergency assistance for election benefits.
Other 2600 surgeries, including orthopedic interventions and treatments due to grey star, are intended to eliminate residues.
In addition, there are money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-care after stationary stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of an electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
“These investments meet the ideas that clinicians affected told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system,” Tanya Plibersek said.
The minister was on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding to get money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly where the additional funds were spent.
A three-head Commission will be established and aims to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and as efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would benefit little if “they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course.”
Despite this, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I am confident that the federal aids will make a great contribution to taking the state’s public health system from the list of concerns,” Wilkie said.
According to the government of the state, these election benefits will largely compete with recent cuts.
However, the federal opposition’s health policy spokesman, Peter Dutton, believes that today’s announcement is only a “planar solution”.
“We are in the situation today because the laboratory government has taken $430 million from the health system,” he told ABC TV.
It cannot be that a state government will remove almost half a billion dollars from the system and put the Commonwealth in 300 million and then do as if it is the good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to guarantee that no single dollar of the rescue package will be spent for additional bureaucracy.

Syria has destroyed its possibility to manufacture chemical weapons, a surveillance group says
Syria has destroyed important facilities for manufacturing chemical weapons and gip gas munitions, the global surveillance group for chemical weapons said Thursday, while there were severe collisions in the north of the country near one of the sites where allegedly toxic substances are stored.
Even on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the Civil War began soon three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the date on
The Hague-based organization set up Damascus to destroy or “make inoperable” all chemical weapons facilities, including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important mileage of an ambitious schedule aimed at the destruction of all Syria’s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has to begin to destroy existing weapons and stocks.
According to assumptions, there are around 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarine.
The announcement came at a time when struggles took place in the town of Safira on Thursday by experts say there is a production facility for chemical weapons and warehouses, as the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.
The group of activists who track the number of dead through a network of activists in Syria said on Thursday, 120,296 people died.
There were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the side of the government, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 are government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Among the dead were also 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the United Nations estimated the number of dead in this conflict to be 100,000 since March 2011.
This number has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to escape from the country.
Assad’s troops have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels, many of whom have links to al-Qaeda groups.
The observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but no details were called.
The struggles underline the danger exposed to chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to liberate Syria from its poisonous weapon arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of an overwhelming civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team is “convinced that it has seen all major production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and experienced their destruction.”
Therefore, “no further inspection activities are currently planned.”
Earlier the week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of the checks and visited 21 out of 23 sites specified by Damascus.
Due to safety concerns, visiting two facilities was not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two locations were “submitted ... and the existing objects of the Chemical Weapons Programme were moved to other inspected facilities.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved next month by the OPWC Executive Committee.
“I take the hat ahead of the courage and courage that you all showed when fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization,” said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director General of the Monitoring Organization in a comment published by OPCW.
For meanwhile, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad’s government and their security forces, who belong to many members of the Alawites, a split of Shiite Islam.
In terms of further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion is not known, he explained.
Anger on judgment for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted angry about the judgment for the last of the incentive who was filed in court because Umar Patek was to be killed in his view.
Patek, who was on the flight for almost ten years as one of Southeast Asia’s most sought-after people, was convicted yesterday to a 20-year prison sentence for his role in the construction of explosive bodies for the bombing.
With penalty suspension, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of the mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
An accusation was also made in a series of terrorism-related accusations, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Holy Night in 2000.
The prosecutor had requested a lifelong prison sentence, even if for the man who is also referred to as a “demolition man” because of his call, the death sentence could have been applied.
The decision has awakened painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twin-sister Jane and Jenny in the devastation directed by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago.
With tears fighting, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow the footsteps of the other guys.
“You should put him in front of a shooting command,” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with no more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was made equal to the ground, when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 23:00 a.m., a huge bomb exploded in a small laster, which was parked before the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicidal assassinator made an explosive-filled backpack exploded.
After the attack, he fell into the koma for a month and “died” three times as he bound to a life-keeping system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the blood bath and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before everyone else.
To leave him alive – no, there is no reason to leave him alive.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers in court.
He left almost a decade of arrest, but was finally raised in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed almost four months later the former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports had provided the notice that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t stand,” Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no repentance for how much suffering he has caused to other people.
The judgment took place prior to the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, committed with memorial celebrations in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not lead to phone talks)
Flight travellers can now use their electronic devices for reading, playing, playing, music and watching films, but not calling with the phone, according to the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented, depending on the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airline companies must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the staff’s training manuals and the regulations for the storage of the devices in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines that want to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could soon approve the advanced use of electronic devices," the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
You cannot start it again until the plane has reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives green light.
When entering the landing approach, the passengers must turn them off and do not restart them before the plane is landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft were secured against electronic disorders could allow their passengers to use the devices even when starting, landing and on the rolling field, the FAA said.
Most new traffic aircraft and other aircraft that have been reequipped for the use of Wi-Fi at larger heights should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the professional association of professional flight companion, welcomed the changes.
“When the new regulation is safely implemented – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it,” Glading said.
We are honestly sorry to feel like attentive on this topic.
Nevertheless, Internet connections to surfing, exchange of emails, text messages, or download of data under three kilometres remained prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are asked to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into the flight mode.
So no “Words With Friends” still, the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave a publicly-effective American Airlines jet because he refused to turn off the device while the aircraft was parked on the step.
And heavier devices such as laptops also need to continue to be conserved because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Cell phone talks during the flight also remain prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone talks is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift prohibition of certain electronic devices when launching and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker said from the National Transportation Safety Board, safety expert for national transportation issues on CBS News, mobile phones would still be considered as a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem not only because they could potentially cause disturbances in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disturb transmitting masts,” Rosenker said.
A consulting committee of the industry launched by the FAA to investigate this topic last month recommended that the government allow a broader use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on the FAA has increased to reduce restrictions on use.
Critics like the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe there are no valid safety reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become everywhere.
In some studies, it is discussed that up to one-third of passengers forget or ignores shutting off the device.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travellers in 1966 after reports of navigation and communication devices disruptions by passengers carried out by FM radios, which were the latest technical trend at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by FAA that they do not make any electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi for passengers for several years when the flight height has been reached.
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the stronger use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally give significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only give minimal radiation when replacing.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
Among the advocates of relieving the restrictions on the use of devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Readers made a test flight to identify problems but could not find.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings regarding the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd, the National Association of Airline Passengers, said he believed that the disturbance of the devices is genuine, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there are only single reports from pilots that speak for a disruption of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange the shutdown of the devices by the passengers in the case of instrument landing in poor view conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adaptation for travellers who would be equipped with extensive technology today.
“We are happy that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in contradiction with security,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Released by air rescue of the North Sea Bore Island saved bird
A bird flying to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drill island, was released back into nature.
Last month, the water rails were flying to Aberdeen with a helicopter, where it was stuck up by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA in its rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said, “This water rails were probably a winter traction bird from Northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently, the exhausted bird was looking for shelter on the bore island.
He added, “He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the request for help.”
When released, the water rails were fit and healthy again.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those in the UK who care for wealth and work want to change our relationships with the EU.
For this purpose, we ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey among British business leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business managers, representing British business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies now export outside Europe and focus on countries that modernize and grow while states in the EU stagnate.
They wish that new trade connections with countries such as China, India and Brazil be favored by the government’s side instead of staying with the long and effortless process to reform the obscure EU institutions.
Asked for certain topics regulated by law – from the cartel law to the product law – the majority of the business leaders believe that control over these key skills should be recovered to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction on the internal market, since the costs of Brussels rules would now override the benefits of being part of the European trade zone, according to the company’s statement – even 40 percent of large enterprises agreed to those traditionally most European-friendly.
Finally, and most probably, our survey of business leaders revealed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This insight, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is pushing towards a “sensitive change” that brings action back to the UK.
It’s about a lot – changes to the agreement and better conditions for the UK would lead to 16 percent changes of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy stands behind its plan for the renegotiations of the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to Britain from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and is increasingly necessary after the eurozone now moves towards a narrower economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means an enhanced attention to trade for companies and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations.
Alexei Miller from Gazprom refers to pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gasery
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria is the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom Board said.
“Today’s event is a milestone: Building works on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream Gaspipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, have begun,” said Gazprom’s Chief Executive Officer Alexei Miller in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy safety of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to ensure more diversity in Russia’s export routes across Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, in which most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, is concerned about an increased risk of conventional routes, as is heard from official side.
Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks linked to transit countries are “forever” off.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream to discount rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction works in other subordinated countries are expected to begin on the planned route to the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, no way passes the real estate location of Germany.
The economic framework data vote, and the financing opportunities are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th real estate of the exchange newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic framework in the country in European comparison.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, noted this on the 9th Real Estate Day of the Börse Zeitung.
As far as German commercial property is searched, the view of the transaction volume shows, says Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year section.
In the UK, the plus was only 6%, and in France was 19%.
“Property investments offer an attractive interest rate,” said Ulbrich.
The return distance between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees accused of sexual offences against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were accused of sexual offences related to children before charges were charged against child caregiver Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, as the Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children learned.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA declared that “one had never had to deal with an incident of sexual child abuse in the organization.”
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which an YMCA employee was accused of offence with child pornography, and another in which an athlete teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted in 1991 for the abuse of children entrusted to him.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission’s assistant lawyers that he knew the first case but did not know the second case.
He acknowledged that the YMCA opening declaration to the Commission was also inaccurate in the allegation that "the YMCA has given external checks in which the YMCA was recognized as the first front in children's safety."
Instead, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Department of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who began at YMCA at 21 years old, admitted that the management failed "from me downwards" in Lord's hiring and did not ensure that employees were clear about their obligations to report violations of children's safety guidelines.
Lord was sentenced to twelve boys for sexual offence in early this year during his two-year-old YMCA work.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare, however, argues that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord’s violations regarding children’s safety.
The employees said they had observed violations, among other things that Lord was alone with children, privately cared for her as a babysitter, let her sit on his shoulder, told one that he loved it, and let children play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superintendent was and asked for a training for child protection because she was concerned about her behavior, said that child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the superintendent of Lords in the YMCA Caringbah, was “very frightening and most of the time was very unparalleled.”
The managing director said he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have believed to refund their superintendent.
Instead, he said, rather, had affected their friendship with Lord their judgment capacity, and why they had not reported him.
Hare explained that he told the Board of Directors of the YMCA NSW his view that the lesson to draw the organization from the "Jonathan Lord Intermediate Case" "not to report" by employees, and the Board of Directors agreed to him.
Hare said the decision to urge employees to sign confidentiality commitments shortly after the accusations occurred was made by the Children’s Children’s Officer of YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should be prevented from contamination of evidence, but which had been "over-equal" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was in the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, not being a safe organisation for children, said Professor Stephen Smallbone from Griffith University, an expert in sexual child abuse, the Commission.
He explained that there have been “core problems” in employee hiring, verification, elaboration, training and supervision.
The hearing was delayed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would use the chance to return as British Prime Minister – but he acknowledges that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the fifth anniversary of his exit from the office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic topics.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after a decade as a head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments generally restricted foreign policy and his role as a messenger of the Middle East Peacekeeper Quartet.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister’s office, Blair was quoted from the London Evening Standard with the words: “Yes, sure, but it’s unlikely that will happen, so...”
When the horse view experts met in troops in Cardiff to cut the horse of the year, they were aware that a hard competition was predicted.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, which is not even in the kindergarten and took its first steps just a few months ago, and his Shetland pony toffee was loose through the three rounds and earned the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind themselves.
The unseparable couple, both equally large, were praised for their appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he appeared in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate hat in a fucking angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural abilities when dealing with the pony that was much above his age.
And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then practiced with the Shetland pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “Fenton and Toffee are a great thing.”
They had to go against the entire participant field and left the square with gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Fully strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows the footsteps of his Aunt Sharon Howells, who has been driving horses for over ten years.
Howells said, “The entire audience was like electrified and everyone fired him and shot him.”
He ran on sand all the length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens to care for.
Just as it started, it won’t take a long time until it’s on the horse of the year – and I’m sure it’s going to cut well.
An annual horse view spokesman said, “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to handle his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The judges evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how well they had hit and presented themselves in the preliminary ring.
They look for good collaboration between pony and leaders – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I’m sure that Fenton’s sweet clothes have helped her part to suit that really fits perfectly to the occasion.
Chinese newspaper is to be “reformed” after calling
A Chinese newspaper that on the title side had requested the release of a reporter accused of diffamation should be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call to release journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later acknowledged on television that he had accepted kidnapping money to fake reports about a part-state company.
Now the New Express is subjected to “comprehensive rectification,” the regulatory authority said.
The “Rectifier Order” was carried out by the Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and TV in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations found that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several incorrect reports about the exchange-noted company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial management of the New Express was unordered,” the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said it was decided to impose an administrative punishment for Chen Yongzhou and remove his reporter’s license.
In addition, “the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to make a full rectification of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant responsible for the New Express and immediately verify the leadership team of the New Express.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported about alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machinery named Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the title page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared in the state television and admitted that he published false reports against payment.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and their ability to gain public confidence,” he told CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was on money and glory.
I realized that I did wrong.
Following Chen’s apology, the New Express published an apology on the title page and explained that you failed to check the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change in law early the year in which the authorities were banned from forced someone to blame themselves.
Discovered drug tunnel with its own railway between the United States and Mexico
One of the most refined tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electrical railway operations, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120-fold 90-inch measuring tunnels as one of the finest passages they ever found.
The tunnel, which runs over a length of almost six football fields, connects storage halls near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless invisible warehouses, making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before unrecognized drugs could be transported there, the authorities said.
During the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were guaranteed, according to the court records.
Three men, according to the authorities, who worked as a driver, were accused of the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They threaten prison sentence between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers put on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which brings drug cardles to the challenge of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-meter-long passage with railways from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love
Actors Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love themselves.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has expressed herself to separate her wife, Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, which was to be broadcast on Friday, Bloom said, “life sometimes doesn’t go exactly as we plan or hope it.”
Kerr and he himself still loved themselves, the 36-year-old said.
“We will support each other and love each other as Flynn’s parents.”
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, their son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to Lexika, veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but it differs in a significant manner.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cranes, ice or a strong edamer, they are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the absence of meat and fish, the vegan leaves from all consumption of animal products - even honey is denied.
What remains, you might wonder, but when you look closer, the vegan dietary world is characterized by a significant inventive richness.
"Broad strips are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the Reform House, which has a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also enjoys visiting the shop in the Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealand lives vegan, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. "1997 I converted my diet and became vegetarian."
The next step took place around the century and I became vegan.
“But the conviction came not only because of diet, but because of shoe choice,” says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather normal leather.
He realized that it also comes to other daily issues without animal products.
It is vegan to be an ethics.
“I don’t want animals to die for me,” says Proctor, the maximum of the Vegans, which extends to the whole consumption behavior.
Instead of following burgers, rubbers or rubbers, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products that increased enthusiasm.
“It’s a double bonus,” says Proctor today, “in fact, it’s not vegan to give up, it’s not ascese, it’s an enrichment.” The assumption that you’re reducing the selection of food options with the nutritional change leads rather to the power of the habit.
And precisely these conditions also allowed some so well-meaning attempts to fail.
“The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that quickly gives up many, similar to smoking,” says Proctor.
And he says, "Some tastes are not attached to the animal."
Often it is the spices or the kind of preparation that make up the taste.
“You can also create the same effect in other ways,” the vegans said.
To a barbecue festival, for example, Proctor brings aubergines, mushrooms and also a few vegan wrinkles.
It takes attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it is intended to taste deeply once.
Of course, you want to have something between your teeth, that’s legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but it's not just to reduce animal food," Proctor said.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he has not suffered.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I don’t take foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin share.
There are high-performance athletes who feed themselves exclusively vegan.
“My blood values are fine, I’m often checking,” says Proctor.
Especially for the lack of vitamin B12, many vegan-simus critics warn.
“Because animals are fed with feed instead of grazing on the bread, it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the cooler, the vitamin B12 portion is high,” says Proctor.
For vegans, there is also the opportunity to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Proctor does not need to go for food procurement.
There are basic foods everywhere and every supermarket has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need, I find on site.
Only at times I buy something special.
“Many people forget that only finished products are expensive, but so it is known for “usual” finished products as well.”
However, the preparation of vegan dishes was much cheaper and less time-consuming than generally accepted.
“There’s a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with a few small knives you can get good if not sometimes better results,” says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbohydrate instead of eggs, with his vegan cheese cakes, Proctor was also able to amaze his grandparents.
Family festivals give the vegans a new spice.
This has dynamics when cooking together, this has a new importance.
“The situations that can arise in this process are as different as people themselves,” says Proctor.
But, of course, he has already been met with skeptics.
Doesn't my meal taste you anymore?
“Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?” – in such questions you have to act as a vegan with a fingertip feeling.
“I don’t reject people, I am part of this society,” Proctor doesn’t want to eat an enclave.
And more precisely, the world of everyday life does not seem as strange as suspected - and the vegan does not seem as restricted in everyday life as generally accepted.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are apples everywhere!
“Many donner stores offer Falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka,” says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he removes pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, everything is a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slowly remembered.
“When I started eating myself vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult,” the New Zealand can find a development: “You have to talk to the people, call them attention to it.”
“If enough demands come, they may be inclined to supplement the menu,” he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the combus in Mannheim or the Vogelfree Café.
Proctor has the desire that other restaurants also have at least a vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, there are vegan dishes for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
“Flesh dishes are, however, exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others,” says Proctor.
“If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a safe way to make the biggest part of the first impossible,” says Proctor.
But purchasing vegan products can be a little difficult at the beginning.
Especially when you learn to understand that animal additives can also contain as a colorer in nuts, you seem to quickly leave courage by following ethics in so many obstacles and falls.
Not only is why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are built in food but also cleaning agents.
“Before and after you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to pay attention to “It’s sometimes better to take small steps than to stand or stumble,” says Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral fingerprint that strikes consciousness.
Perhaps he doesn’t fully manage to dismiss his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to critically question his habits.
The exchange operator Nasdaq OMX continues to breathe its customers.
Trade at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a notification, the operator responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven U.S. option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhinderedly.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger paintings with the stock exchange operator.
On Tuesday, the Nasdaq indexes were not calculated for an hour because of data transport errors.
In August of this year, there had been two pans alone in a week.
First, the U.S. Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively defective purchase orders to the option markets because of technical problems.
Then the exchange operators took almost a whole day to check out and remove the orders.
Two days later, half of the entire stock trade in the United States came out for several hours due to a computer strike at the Nasdaq exchange.
In the past year, Facebook’s exchange had also been taken care of.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of purchase and sales orders, later the SEC exchange supervision established and gave the company a record penalty of $10 million.
Constance: Radler runs 63-year-old
According to the police, the accident came when a 26-year-old man on Thursday night at around 22:00 a.m., with a women’s bike unlawfully on the left walk from the station station towards the marketplace.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man came on the walk from a local, the bicycle driver, according to police, could no longer break in time.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the wall of the house, moved to the ground in the further course and draws about 15 centimeters of space wound on the head.
A rescue car team brought the injured to medical treatment to the clinic.
British police issue Assange an expedition order
The UK police today handed out an order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard explained that he had a 40-year-old Australian "invitation to stand up" to invite him to appear in a police guard, and added if he should not meet, threatens him to arrest.
Assange threatens the delivery to Sweden for the charge in sexual offence, after his possibilities have been exhausted under British law, since the Upper Court has rejected his opposition to the delivery early this month.
As he feared that Stockholm will deliver him to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has “invited his 40-year-old man to meet with a police guard at a time we chose,” a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on deposit.
The message did not comment on the police request.
Assange fears that he will be delivered by Sweden to the United States and accused there for possible spionage allegations after publishing over 250,000 diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks website.
Driver with 210 km/h and hot drinking between the legs receives £1,000 penalty
A driver was imposed a penalty of £1,000 because he had driven up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drinking bowl between his legs.
In front of the Colchester Court, Howie recognized himself to be guilty without having drawn the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also convicted of paying £90 costs as well as a victim supplement of £100.
Tax for foreign real estate owners against London's speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but still waiting for the final decision of Treasury Chancellor George Osborne, who in 2012 imposed a stamp tax of 7% on apartments that cost more than two million pounds and annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Income from stamp tax for residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which were £708 million in the fiscal year 2012/13, combined income for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said, “After the increases in stamp tax on high-priced homes and the introduction of the legislation that is associated with it against a movement, it is difficult to argue that high-quality property is too low taxed, regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system.”
“But this step could make some foreign investors more retainable as to the purchase of real estate in London, or prevent owners from selling it,” he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy London southwest belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, has grown up to the record value of 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed a uniform annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging “domestic market” on which the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, Savills said.
Scientists were able to throw more light on the context of a dog’s tail beads with his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with their tail moved more to the right (from the dog’s perspective), while it was the left side in nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at Trient University, said, “In people, it is well known that the left and right half of the brain reacts differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right brain half is responsible for moving the left, and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the side of their counterparts, the researchers watched the animals while looking at these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail moves in one direction, in the other direction.
Professor Vallortigara said, “We have shown dogs movies with dogs – either a naturally true version or a silhouette to eliminate other distracting aspects, and we could control the movement of the tail more left or right.”
When the animals saw a otherwise unexpressed dog moved their tail to the right (from the perspective of the rolling dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail inclination was primarily to the left (repeatedly from the perspective of the dog who slides), then their heart rate increased and they looked unrelented.
According to Professor Vallortigara, dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
He is rather convinced that dogs learned from experience, what movements they should worry about and when not.
He said, “If you have different encounters with other dogs and wedding with your tail is linked to a rather friendly behavior in one direction and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you respond based on these experiences.”
The researchers say that the findings of dog owners, veterinarians and coaches could help to better understand the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, an expert in dog behavior and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Healing at the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study in which it was investigated whether left and right is important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turned their head left when they look at an aggressive dog, and right when it comes to a happy dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, “dogs are rather going to a robot dog if their ‘Swan’ is moving left and not to the right, rather than becoming upset – exactly different from the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore affect that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.
“There are substantial evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, but many of the details have to be determined – and dogs are no exception there,” Bradshaw said.
Because their behavior is simply recorded, it will probably not take a long time until we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys Displaced Appearance in Glasgow Due to Disease Alex Turners
The Rockband Arctic Monkeys has moved an appearance in Glasgow after her leadsinger has been sick to throat inflammation.
The band from Sheffield will be playing at Hydro on Friday.
Due to the illness of the lead singer Alex Turner, however, the concert needs to be moved.
The band announced it came after she had to move a show at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must cancel the show at Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st.”
Alex Turner has been diagnosed with cavity inflammation, so unfortunately he cannot occur.
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November, which was moved to the Hydro in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets retain validity for these shows.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will be appointed for the first time on 22 February new cardinals of the Catholic Church, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest rank clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who elect a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
Currently there are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the Pope election – this is agreed to a group of 120 "voted cardinals".
In a statement announced the message, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of the Vatican, said it will take place a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony to be held for the appointment of the new cardinals, also known as the Consistorium.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to summon the Consistorium in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero from Catholic Voices said the number of voted cardinals will probably fall until February.
He explained that a Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as needed so that the number of voted cardinals would be 120 again, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The consistorium next year is important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero said.
Currently there is a certain overlapping on the sides of Europe and particularly Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.
Fourty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first ones to be called since the formation of the Council of the Cardinals founded by Francis for a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, who have the mandate to find opportunities for the reform of the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He explained that it was “goodly possible” that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.
However, we have not yet been in this situation – that’s all quite new.
Valero said that the bishops of great places would typically be called to cardinals, but Francis is “full surprises – so we don’t know who he appoints.”
GM Returns New Pickup Trucks to Repair Seat Leather
General Motors calls back nearly 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup trucks in 2014 to solve a problem with the manually adjustable seat line, a statement from the U.S. Vehicle Safety Regulatory Authority on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal vehicle safety guidelines on head supports.
“When it is riding from behind the vehicle, it is possible that the head support does not properly protect the inmates, so that there is an increased risk of injury,” the statement said on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of the GM trucks began in June, representing the leading U.S. car manufacturer’s most important model launch since insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October.
Due to the 16-day government shutdown, the NHTSA could not check the notification letter, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redeveloped for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra Pickup trucks.
The GM stock increased by 1.4% on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Despair screams of Obama voters
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible.
He says Obama has made praiseful efforts that have been denied by the blockade tactics of Republicans
Blockade policy doesn’t apologize to Obamacare’s website issues that drone attacks
Obama’s memories about the 2008 election campaign were a sad memory of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I currently read a terrible sad book.
It is a book I believed that it would give me hope during the stupid second year of my medical study.
It is called “The Audacity to Win” and signs Barack Obama’s memories for the 2008 presidential election.
When I finished my patient leaflets at night and go to bed, the book leads me back to a time when politics inspired millions and stole the breath from a speech.
The election became an earth-winner and news speakers held in to show the historic meaning of this hour.
My classmates were crying for joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had 82% approvals.
And then I close the book.
Turning back to the present is a bad awakening, as if you’re taken away from a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I gave my voice for the first time, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced waste of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Ladens.
I also believe that the partial-political blockade tactics have cut too many efforts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public health insurance option, and the closing of Guantanamo Bay to name only a few.
But after I have defended Obama’s government countless times against colleagues and acquaintances, I’m at the end of my explanation trials.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why you are allowed to listen to foreign heads or to kill innocent children through drones in the overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private life of Americans and why whistleblowers are punished to disclose state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was murdered without proceedings, or why public financing and output boundaries are overthrown during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report in which it is said that the White House’s efforts to calm the media are the “most aggressive ... since the Nixon government.”
And recently, it cannot apologize for the inability to design a simple website in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood aged 18 that government work could oppose political campaigns before it.
Obviously, the Deputy Office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events like the Newtown massacre shape the public discussion.
But if I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to be largely chosen by the government itself.
And that bothers me most.
I elected Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidate.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and uncovered alternative, he seemed to be unable to set his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hope we had heard of so long.
However, with the decline of Obama’s approval values to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 through this book has become so harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved in the air.
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to take a serious loss against Clinton in the pre-elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electoral assistants after the decision, he told his employees that they should come back to the course and follow the purpose of their matter.
“I want us to find our magic again,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
Five years later, Mr President, and I couldn't agree to you stronger.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest during parental leave
Billionaire Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his parent holiday plans because his daughters are pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnet, which is in a court dispute about the payment of $6 million to CO2 tax, raised the claim when he wanted to wipe questions from the table whether he would find himself in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important to decide whether CO2 and mining taxes are removed or shortened.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott’s daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
“He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets vacation,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission Palmer, with 53 votes, officially declared the winner of Fairfax’s Sunshine Coast Seat.
Palmer requested a revision of the vote counting process so that it goes faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why should we have no system in which you enter data into a computer, select immediately and then have the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the vote list.
Do you use them because you can then radiate the results if you don’t like it?
Today it is incredible to match with pencils.
The election commission has reviewed the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint bill proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that his policy belongs to an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office "very seriously".
In a public office, it is about the public service.
“We seek no reward except history, that we can serve in a critical time of this community,” he said.
RBS suspended two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its currency department, so two people familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global government investigation of alleged manipulation on the currency market is quickly taking ride.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they work with the authorities in investigations in the world’s largest financial market, on which $5.3 billion is changing the owner daily.
The two merchants would be the first RBS employees suspended in the expansion investigation that the scandal moves around the Libor interbank business.
The bank, who did not comment on suspensions, confirmed this month that it received information requests from authorities.
“Our investigations on this issue continue and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation indicated that the RBS has transmitted the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to a former dealer to the British supervisory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is supposed to have been licensed from his current position as European leader of the forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was licensed this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders were accused of any misconduct.
Usher’s Instant Message group, bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, said people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that she has taken steps against some of her employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma declared that she was investigating alleged manipulation of the currency market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers should have agreed on transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks cast instant messages and emails from several years looking for cases of misconduct.
The news about these investigations has turned merchants into an area that has been one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume in currency trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms by banks leads to "man can already influence the market at very low ticket prices."
The news came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that it had terminated a dealer of its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after causing a loss of almost $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and works with them.
“We’re sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is overwhelmed,” Credit Suisse said.
Painted the building range on the Bechtle groundpiece
A group of citizens' initiative "Schweiz Wiese" has enhanced the range on the Bechtle grounds at the course promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
Besides, she cleaned and spread the footpath, it says in a press release.
The planned coverage of the decaying house in the rear part of the plot was not allowed for safety reasons, because the ground threatens to slide.
Alfred Abel, currently managing the property, had declared the beauty action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Prior to the action of the BI, a transparency with the embassy "We've been for it" was adjusted.
However, this disturbed the approximately 20 members of the citizen initiative with little in their action.
Your motto on the big poster called "We are against barruins."
In this way, she wanted to point out the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project one day should fail.
In conversation with many passengers in front of the "Building" it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city's project will be better, although not many have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they begin to resign because the city further delays these answers, BI says.
As it was to be heard, the Mayor's public statements also have an impact.
May had said at the municipal council meeting that he feared the out for the thermal bath, the citizens should vote against the plans for a swimming and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some are therefore just afraid, others feel them as a "pleasing attempt to express" on the population, the press release of the BI continues to say.
The BI thanked the donors for the colour and all helpers.
Rangnick Skelt for Schiris: Don't Mane a Sword King
As much as Ralf Rangnick is satisfied with the current high-form of Bundesliga Table Guide Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the "bulls" was disappointed by the arbitrators.
“There is currently a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan will be pushed into the category Schwalben Kings,” he took the two offensive wirblers on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The recent occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Grodig last Sunday, where the Senegalese became a supposed acting assault - which was not, of course, as the TV pictures showed.
"A crazy misdecision," said Rangnick, who called Harkam "totally overwhelmed."
Harkam would also have contributed to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the match.
He defended his German landsman: “I would have behaved equally like Roger Schmidt in every situation.”
Schmidt himself does not want to have had contact with his colleague after the sharmutzel with Hütter.
I wouldn't know why.
"Because I am the one who was insulted," said the 46-year-old.
But in the face of the success, Rangnick agreed with a hymn of praise.
“There are only two words for that: right,” he said.
There isn't much to suspend.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
It's gonna go quietly.
Changes in winter transfer will hardly be made.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"Except a player comes up with the desire that he wants to leave the club," Rangnick said.
Supreme Court confirms Obama’s health law
It is a big victory for the Obama government: the U.S. Supreme Court today decided that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five-to-four votes, the judges judged that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces American citizens to complete or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the State’s tax authority.
Supreme Judge John Roberts hit the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided on the contrary.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the comprehensive 2700 pages of the law and declared that the provision of the health law that states should either expand the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise remove all state Medicaid funding is not constitutional.
The lawsuit was held by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was decisively rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the ultimate challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place makes light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian place have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low degree of sunfall, the Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord Valley, usually sinks in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three giant reflectors at 45 meters of height, a century dream was realized on Wednesday.
"Eventually!", Mayor Steinar Bergsland blacked at the starting ceremony at TV2.
Some valley inhabitants set up sun chairs, others set up safety-based sunglasses.
So far, hungry people had to drive to a nearby peak in the winter with a cable car.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to steer the rays with mirrors into the valley.
This basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After a multi-year debate, the city council finally adopted the expensive project of 5 million crowns (about 615,000 euros).
A similar construction has been creating winter sunshine to the Italian Alpine town of Viganella for several years.
Post is hardly empty on Sundays
“Many citizens have not yet noticed that the red points for Sunday empty are still located at different postcases of the core city and the districts, but reading the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find out that the empty is no longer taking place on Sundays and holidays,” the FDP said.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only before the post building is empty in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld.
Whether it is still empty in Hofheim and Rosengarten, the answer to the FDP's request will not be answered.
The social and youth political spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Rohrenbeck, wants to go here.
The Sunday emptiness is an important post service at Terminalpost.
“This thinly undertaking despite the price rise for letters in January 2013 radically and inappropriately.”
Thomas Bittner, Chairman of the Liberals, supports his colleague: "What annoys me is the fact that the times of empty here are changed or removed."
The post is close to citizens.
"At least the postcases in the districts of Neuschloss and Rosengarten must be empty again on Sunday," said Bittner and Tubebeck unisono.
Even for the core town, especially non-mobile citizens would also have to reach a letter box with Sunday emptiness on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration plans to talk with the post about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post has not communicated with Lampertheim.
However, in Hofheim there is also a Sunday emptiness.
Your party has spoken for privatizations.
“Then decisions are made elsewhere,” Maier said.
Frankfurt Parking Fees to Rise Strongly
Parking in Frankfurt might soon become more sensitive.
The city’s magistrate advises this morning on a template of traffic officers Stefan Majer (Green).
Parking fees are expected to be increased by 50%.
However, prices are not to be raised, but the time interval of parking clocks and parking tickets are to be shortened from 30 minutes to 20 minutes.
In December, the City Order Assembly will have to decide.
The IHK Frankfurt retail committee considers it “no good idea.”
The possibility of parking immediately in front of the business is "a not to be underestimated advantage for smaller specialist dealers".
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is "reasonable and actually long overlapable".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Quick actions surprise hosts
With a narrow cader, the men I of the TSV Freudenstadt in the Schiller School Hall in Reutlingen had to join the TG Gönningen from the Schwebische Alb.
Although the elbows were with an experienced team on the other side of the network.
But soon it turned out that they were not able to fully compete with the rapid actions of the pleasure cities, even in relation to age.
With the hard and placed assaults, the Gönningers became extremely difficult.
Repeatedly they missed the passports and attacks played cleanly through the network centres by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz and were not in the block defence.
Two high first rate gains clearly expressed the superiority of the Freudenstadt in all matters.
In view of this oppressive and play-determining performance then the third sentence was a little lazy and lustlessly gained at the 3:0 end (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There, on November 2, with the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to be clearly implemented in Nagold, a significantly more powerful opponent will stand on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bauerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams of Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were facing in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-competitive two-hour match.
Nervozity on both sides caused particularly mistakes and point gifts in the ball taking; even in the passes, the precision was sometimes defective and in some critical game scenes, the overeeper prevented the view for possible point wins.
In this highly balanced encounter, Marcus Blasutto’s TSV team voted the great physical use and a pleasant engagement of both teams.
Day of nursing at the small English hut
For the fifth day of nursing in the following of the Natura 2000 project on top of Hotzenwald, a group of engaged participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, it should be cut off in the valley on that day in the area of the cottage of view, Mayor Helmut Kaiser said.
Many hikers, so Emperors, described this area as the glossy piece of the mountains, on which the landscape offers the ideal framework for magnificent views.
He thanked the attendees for their willingness to collaborate and emphasized that the day of nursing is an appropriate tool to strengthen the connection of humans and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to place accents in nature itself.
At the same time, with the tourist aspect, the environmental consideration can also be taken into account.
This ecological aspect, Friederike Tribukait explained from the Department of Natural Protection of the Government Presidency of Freiburg following the welcome by Landcouncil Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the screen and wishes to succeed the action.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the wide view covers with the aim of maintaining the old allmendweedfield with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting with the still existing winds.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces.
You need these free connections to maintain art.
Tribukait said she did not want to miss a lance for the planned biosphere area at this point.
The current action is not only seamlessly attached to this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity to sustainable economic and environmental development based on the internationally recognized UNESCO status and thus a continuous supplement to the future achieved with the Life Project and the previous care days.
According to these various statements, Revier Manager Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischof shared the helpers into groups.
The bigger trees had already been beaten in advance, and the forest tractor is ready to be retrieved.
A group of helpers should take care of the exemption of wardrobe bushings and the care of a dry stone rod.
The aim was the free view at the viewpoint.
Löffingen: Köpfler is still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baar city of Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a future-oriented school, children, youth and senior policy, as well as its own city works, has not yet registered a second mayor candidate.
As the only candidate for the succession of the no longer candidate mayor Norbert Brugger, for the reasons of age, is the 46-year-old banking manager and business manager Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11, at 18am.
Google, Samsung, Huawei accused of Nortel
The group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, strictly announced on Thursday a lawn of charges for patent infringement against cell phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was overturned by him during Nortel’s insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that Nortel bought patents for $4.5 billion, accused Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies of patent breaches before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents call for technology that brings search terms in line with relevant advertising on the Internet, according to the lawsuit, which thus calls for the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are producing mobile phones working with Google’s Android operating system that is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial offer of over $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google increased its offering several times and last offered $4.4 billion.
After it was overwhelmed with the Nortel patents of Rockstar, Google Motorola Mobility acquired $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola’s library on patents.
“Although Google has failed with his attempt to purchase the patent at the auction, Google has violated the patent and continues to do so,” the lawsuit wrote.
Rockstar calls for a high damage compensation from Google as it claims Google’s patent infringement is intentionally, the accusation said.
Egypt oaths first freely elected president
Mohammed Mursi denies the office, but his triumph day is not likely to mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was sworn as the first free-elected president of the country and thus began the succession of Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from the office 16 months earlier.
With his office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt’s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy approximately 60 years ago.
He put the oath in front of the 18 judges dressed in black clothes of the court, who has his seat on the Nile River and has been found after an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Mursi said at the ceremony that was broadcast live on state television.
“Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life—absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has usually been taken into account as a prohibited organization since its foundation 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police officers guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven o'clock.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered before the court to join the new president, and unlike the presidency of the Mubarak time, the traffic was stopped only for a short time so that the car convoy could cross the usual road that connects the city center to the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic “replacement wheel” of the Brotherhood has mocked his personal prestigious since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to target the 2011 uprising efforts against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt is today a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red cravate to the judges in the wooden chamber in which he detached the office.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was supposed to hold his entry speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel who played the national hymn that he listened to in defence position.
Military leader Hussein Tantawi was present.
At his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of people present in the biggest hearing hall of the university with speakers of “The Army and the People are one hand.”
The university of Cairo, built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, became a high town of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi declared a symbolic oath on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the Uprising, which last year led to the end of Mubarak’s authoritarian rule, and he gave to return presidial powers that the military council had taken over from the head of state chased from the office.
However, with the dismissal of the official oath before the court and not as usual before the parliament, he advocates the will of the military, which suggests that the struggle will continue.
Mursi’s speech on the Tahir square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek ensures two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger Discothek "Blue Velvet" has begun.
Today’s Friday evening it’s called “Pump this party”, tomorrow’s Saturday evening it’s going on with a 25-party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers dropped from heads: severely injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg dropped from a ladder and injured severely.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor at the outside facade of a guest house.
When he climbed onto the ladder on the roof, the ladder slipped away and the man dropped onto the concrete floor.
He suffered severe injuries and was brought to Salzburg’s Landes Hospital with the rescue helicopter “Christophorus 6”.
South Africa rape: twice life-long detention
Nine months after the brutal rape and confusion of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced twice on Friday.
This was reported by the broadcast SABC.
The victim died later from the consequences of severe injuries.
Johannes Kana was found guilty in the early week of the crime.
The act has triggered scare across the country.
In February, the 21-year-old Anene Booysen raped in an industrial area in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
Fourteen hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The view of the young people was so embarrassing that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the process to be in a bar at night with booys.
He also managed to have beat and raped them, but he refused to be responsible for the death of the girl.
The police had initially exhibited several perpetrators, but released two suspects out of prison because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The prosecutor also emphasized during the proceedings that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
In South Africa, rapes are almost everyday: there are approximately 64,000 advertisements annually for sexual violence.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women’s associations in South Africa appreciate the dark numbers in sexual violence but 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the black forest sharks
Jumbo is looking for the "best sharks in the world": for the TV show "Galileo" the Pro7-star Bonndorf visited.
The spokesman clears at the beginning: the most important thing for the shark is the pigs, turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can sharks that you get in any supermarket be a quality product?
Uli as head of the large sharks factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the operation of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favourite sharks," as Jumbo announces the Black Forest sharks.
Only with hair protection and kittel he comes inside the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can take the micro.
Jumbo for strengthening at Quick Imbiss in Waldshut
“I’m working here to be fulfilled quantities,” the television makers, black forest sharks as a mass product.
16,000 keuls a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat share, color: Uli explains what it is worth quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
TV with level?
Details such as the Ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph value.
“I’m looking forward to Roberto Blanco measuring what happens then,” said Jumbo.
Here the level of private television in pure culture is presented.
But watching is still worthwhile.
The spectator sees that breaking the cells continues to be handwork.
Because black forest sharks are traditionally found without bones in the shelf.
The secret of shark is the spice mixture with salt.
Smoke tower and smoke fire reminds Jumbo visually of a "u-boat".
The trick: tanna branches here in smoke provide the special taste of the black forest sharks.
20 days in smoke eventually make the chin almost black.
“Now the disc disappears in the jumbo,” he announces the test feeding.
“It’s really delicious,” says the TV star’s conclusion.
This will allow all stakeholders to live.
Did you think travel agencies belong to the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the entire year and expects record income from travellers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company is now expanding from a cleared annual profit prior to taxes between $325 and $340 million, compared to $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are achieved, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record gain of $290.4 million in the 2011/12 period.
As managing director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre earned eight percent profits in the first half of the year and made a strong start in the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries are profitable and some of them are on a good way towards record year income prior to interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which typically belong to one of our strongest results.
In Australia, the recreational industry recovered in the second half of the year, resulting in a slightly weaker business travel market.
Similarly, it went well for the recreational business of Flight Centre in the UK, while business customers also spent less here.
The U.S. business recovered compared to the weaker seasonally related first half-year, making it expected a profit for the entire year for the third year in a row.
Flight Centre shares rose by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Schools are stopped to focus on mathematics, writing and grammar
In courses in English literature, students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic lyrics and contemporary British novels from 1914.
The examination also includes “unseen texts” entry to encourage a broader reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015, students have to make an independent GCSE test for language, with strong incentive to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curriculums for English and Mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the audit supervisory authority, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new rating system and less course work.
In a speech in summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is a “wide consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence,” he emphasised that the GCSEs would “be more challenging, ambitious and stricter.”
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent for mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per week per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours per year and Singapore students receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the schedule, from coalition circles it is said that the comprehensive mathematical examination – combined with a stronger weighting in rankings – will probably encourage schools to apply more hours.
The curriculum places more attention to “problems from the right life”, including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes
The most beautiful rabbits of various races and colours present the Circular Association performance show this weekend in the Citizens' House.
The reviews were made on Thursday
The local association W514 will once again host this great exhibition.
Growers of the clubs in the Soest District here show their best animals as well as young wicked hobby holders their rabbits.
On Thursday, six prize judges took the assessment of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are well informed, as the assessment of all animals is fitted on the cages.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Talk Forum
The next ecumenical discussion forum on Monday, 21 October, at the New Museum of the Castle is about the theme "To Hell with Hell - Theological Considerations on the handling of today's last things".
Speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Conversation Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical church communities of Salem, the Castle of Salem and the Official Cultural Lake Bodenkreis.
Johanna Rahner wants to focus on the forum, how today people classify the "last things" after death.
If people in the past centuries knew too much about it, and in this case, put on those images of heaven and hell that "shape our ideas until today," the contemporary prophetic teaching of the hopes of completion will rather be drawn out by a certain confusion or even voicelessness.
“The greater hope is that Christians have been expelled by religious criticism,” the referent says.
She “provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have been missing.”
Johanna Rahner continues to say, “However the decisive challenge remains the scandal of death.”
The question of that desire, "who dreams that everything may be good at the end."
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied from 1982 to 1989 Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg.
In 1997, she promoted Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed the Westphalische Wilhelms University in 2003.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology of the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the Klein Heuberg reaffirmed their faith in the firm
101 15 and 16-year-old young people of the seal care unit Am Klein Heuberg have been entertained in two ministries.
In the morning the Laudato-Si group accompanied the service, in the afternoon of the Youth Choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the firm sacrament, the young people said Yes for their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
The firms had prepared themselves for the great holiday in recent months, led by Diakon Reiner Dehner and the help of numerous community members.
In various projects, they learned various tasks of the Christian community life and jointly experienced the Youth Day in Undermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race enthusiastically participants
With a beautiful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to deal with the round course over the hill chains around the lake.
This is Ulrich Knobel of the organizing sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance of 15 kilometers and 300 meters of heights, were also numerous everyone’s railers who once wanted to exercise their hobby in competition atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the top Germany were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good placements at the German Championships.
These two were able to depart from the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a little time forward to the target and defended his title as a winner of the short distance.
On the second place, Pascal was able to place it again.
Theresa Duelli was the team’s nightmare, who made it the top of the winning stairs.
Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen.
A pleasant development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community.
Not only with regard to performance, the entire range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years of age among the youngest to over 70 years of age among the oldest starters.
In the main race, more absolute topathletes were launched this year.
Four drivers were able to stop from the top regional drivers.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike halb professional from the Black Tusk Racing Team.
Pangerl was already two times world champion in the 12-hour ride along with a teammate.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls his own two German master title in the duathlon.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of height, a finish of flippers came in front of the Three-Sea Hall.
Pangerl raced over the target line as the first.
Only a second behind that, the Routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the overall rating.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came to the target as a third party of the overall rating.
In the women's rating, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
The second place was secured by Areane Blersch from Binzwangen before Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients.
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people.
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him to be the CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George’s Bwelle looked at how his sick father always lost awareness and traveled to hospitals who didn’t have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, capital Cameroon.
First he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation formed, which extended to his brain and there caused a haematom that should affect him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompaniing his father in overwhelmed clinics and hospitals to get there the treatment they had to offer.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle comments.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, but it's not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, says the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States with a doctor is for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroons might not allow themselves to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty limit and almost three-quarters of health expenditure in the country are private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
Poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his counselors suffered to see in Bwelle made the decision mature to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and worked as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels in rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people are forced to get in small buses and drive the medical equipment on the roof over unfastened terrain to the villages that need help.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
More than once they had to move the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be received as heroes: a festive dinner, singing and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and shaft – with its broad smile and its limitless energy – is pleased to attend the joyful celebration.
The next morning the team begins with the investigation of hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 people for a drive,” says Bwelle.
They come from a circle of 60 kilometers around the village – and that’s on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offer medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crystals, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is required for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford themselves.
At night, the team runs easy operations with local anesthesia.
The surgery is usually carried out in a school, town hall or apartment; after the procedure, patients stand up and go into the recreational area to make place for the neighbor.
The lighting for the OP and disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group, thus working wave and its volunteers until early morning hours on Sunday.
It’s a striking pensum, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
“They drum all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will return to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free surgeries last year and knows that with her work it has made a huge difference for the people she helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a breakdown he received now allows him to work again.
“That changes the future of my family,” the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, says Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“I really don’t know when he’s asleep,” says Katie O’Malley, studying Medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and volunteering in Bwelle’s group.
He is either in the hospital or trying to pay money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support Bwell, this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
“We can be involved in operations where we help cut off blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” says O’Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students normally pay their trip to Cameroon themselves and bring often donated health materials with them.
But when they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transportation and guidance.
“He’s absolutely a hero,” says O’Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no boundaries.
For shaft, almost constant work is not a burden.
To help others to live happier and thus fulfill a promise he has given to his Father brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I’m doing this job,” Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he'll see what I'm doing.
I’m doing it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Excellently mastered the struggle
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The old man and the sea", is Horst Janson cut on his body.
Janson is an old rabbit in his metier, the acting art.
No one can deceive the old man Santiago when fishing.
So the two are just complementing great.
It is almost meant that the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, the fisherman Manolo talks about, can be seen.
When Santiago tired of life sits on the chair, this is true at Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and his will.
Janson is on stage in large distances as a single player.
He manages to focus the audience’s attention on himself, so that his monologues are not boring at a moment.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea is composed of only blue lighted water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishermen village.
In the course of the performance, he puts the active scene in light: The Hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise favor, which, with her songs and her magnificent voice, sings Cuba’s feeling of life.
The four musicians play Cuba’s rhythm and are at the same time guests of the bar.
Tourism: Declining to the Romans
At about 120 meters of length, a wastewater channel is obtained from the Roman era below Cologne.
Whoever visits Cologne doesn’t come past the dome.
About 157 meters the two towers run into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
However, only a few visitors who admire the two filigrane church towers suppose there is a lot to discover even under the dome.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne's underworld.
Meeting point for his tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourism directly on the Dom.
The tour begins incredibly spectacularly: “We start in the underground garage,” says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore the remainder of the old city walls remained only what was not too large.
Most users of the parking house are therefore running through the Roman remains today and only take off their car.
But whoever looks more closely, discovers an archaeological foundation in the Park Deck D2, separated by metal grid rods.
Approximately five meters of height can be seen ruins made of hand size stones.
“There are remnants of the Roman city wall that was built after Christ in the second half of the first century,” Schulze says.
Before it comes back to the daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper parking plane still take a look into a dark, 15 meters deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old dome, which is unfortunately hardly perceived.
The next station of the tour is the pretorium, and here the participants climb back to the depth.
Here we experience the office of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the CCAA Pretor.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation means Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinsium", which in good German means as much as "City of Roman Law and City of the Agrippinsians, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the Emperor's Cult".
And the pretorium is the former governor palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the front of the exhibition leads a tunnel access to the Roman wastewater channel, which is preserved here at about 120 meters long.
“You can quietly walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want,” Schulze encourages guests.
A surprise still has Schulze.
After taking the key at the box, he leads the group to a 16-meter deep, accessible shaft.
“We are now in Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath,” he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to reach the groundwater that was indispensable for the ritual washings.
To date, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins go down to the eighth century, varying water levels are readable through changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall, for which the construction work is to begin soon.
Until the completion, however, a few years will be passed.
Nearly Hacked Leg: Re-edition of Rocker Process
A bloody attack in the Rockermilieu is rerolled after more than four years.
A trial for killings, dangerous bodily injury and damage to two 30-year-olds began before the Frankfurt Court.
It is accompanied by strict safety measures.
The accused were silent for the start.
They were supposed to have been active in the rocker scene and then heard of the Bandidos.
In June 2009, the prosecutor argued to have hit three men in a car, together with unknown partners in Finowfurt.
All victims were severely injured, a man would almost have lost his leg.
The victims are supposed to have heard of the competing group of Hells Angels.
One should have been a high-level member of Berlin.
It seems to have been a persecution hunt with several cars.
According to the accusation, it was about fighting and a demonstration of power.
The two accused were released in a first proceedings at the beginning of 2012.
A court spokesman said that it was unable to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloody feed.
The perpetrators were wearing masks and were not recognized.
The Federal Court revoked the judgment after revision of the prosecutor’s office and referred it to the country court for re-hearing.
One of the accused is currently in open execution for another crime.
The beginning was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes in the night.
As a witness, the Commissioner identified at the time was invited.
In the center there were phone talks with the accused and other people who had listened to the police.
It is difficult that Rocker almost always holds a bronze law for them in court – not to state.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had been packed out.
Attorney Stefan Golfier of the Attorney's Office Frankfurt (Oder) said new traces have emerged on demand since the last proceedings.
Eleven further negotiations are held for the process.
The removal society does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but sometime it goes home.
Only: In the baking of people on the passenger and back seat, hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, the one or other cocktail or sect may be responsible for this!
What’s closer than going to the next drive-in to get a little bit?
I agree, I'm happy to be with it when it comes to fast food holen late night or early morning.
A few apples, a cola, a hamburger - and then nix like home and into bed!
But on the way back home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco players are noticeable.
Because what needs to be missing to throw your fast food bags out of the car window with steady regularity?
Especially during the weekends, paper bags are thrown away on streets and on parking spaces.
"Why?" I ask myself.
Are people too dough to take the bags home with respect until the next garbage tray?
It’s not just that the paper toys disrupts the landscape.
Bags have also covered traffic facilities such as guide planks and thus triggered accidents.
About what said “weapon society” but doesn’t think, she probably doesn’t even know what this word actually means.
When you’re on the road more often at night, just with several people in the car, you know how a backbank can look after perfect nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage towers.
There would be a few bags more or less but also nix - unlike the street, where no one wants to walk on the food remains of others.
I see the day comes when the cities and municipalities will be too stupid to depart - and the fastfood chains must demand for their suitcases.
Obama’s Retreat in Health Policy
After heavy criticism yesterday, President Obama made a retreat at his frequently repeated, clear promise: “If you like your health insurance, you can keep them.”
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received an annulment letter, the Republicans said he has deceived the American public in the last few days.
Yesterday, Obama related his original promise.
“The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can retain them,” he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the cancellations, Obama called on those Americans who received such communications to see themselves on the free market after a new insurance.
Most citizens could receive such a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or more expensive than predicted.
"They're going to get a better offer," he said.
The government described it as little surprising that the five percent of the population who had made an insurance themselves needed to look after another tariff, as their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“I want to directly say to these Americans, ‘You deserved better’,” Sebelius said at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform has been “miserable” since October.
“I am just as frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This statement of an appreciated Sebelius to a behind her sitting consultant at yesterday’s hearing in the House of Representatives was accepted from Missouri after a dispute talk with Republican Deputy Billy Long, in which it was concerned whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly pushed on the question of why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily renounce a state-funded insurance in order to complete itself a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem confirms attack on Syrian Air Force Base
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous said on Thursday to CNN that Israeli fighter aircraft had attacked an air base in Syrian Latakia one day before.
The goal was to be "missiles and associated equipment" from which the Israeli government feared they were intended for the Lebanese Hezbollah, CNN said.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port town of Latakia was shot on Thursday night, and the Israelis were responsible for it.
The Israeli Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, on which Russian defense missiles of type S-125 Newa were seen and a battery of SA-3 missiles, according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometers and can transport explosive heads up to 70 kilograms.
The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an also anonymous Israeli government official, saying he believes that Israel has carried out the attack but is not sure.
A spokesman of the Israeli Ministry of Defense said, “We do not comment on these reports.”
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already, in part, successfully attempted to deliver ground-air missiles to the Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt to supply Syria’s Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant the crossing of a “red line” that would follow a military response.
John Kerry states in an unprecedented statement that US spy was “improperly going too far”
John Kerry, with an unexpected statement, suggested a disruption of the US’s defensive attitude towards their monitoring programs, saying the spy has gone “unreasonablely too far” in certain cases.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs also acknowledged he, together with Barack Obama, deceived the responsibility for being switched to “autopilot” when the explosive revelations of the whistleblower Edward Snowden became public about the NSA’s spying activities.
Through the broken information, the U.S. government has fallen into a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies.
At a video-connected speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: “The President and I, and others in the government, have experienced some things that have almost expired by autopilot, just because the ability to remain back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course, September 11.”
He was the first high-level member of the U.S. government that the U.S. spy has crossed a border, but also emphasized that no rights were abused.
He said, “In some cases, this has gone too inappropriately.”
The President is determined to make clarity, and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one must feel like abuse takes place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process will not be impaired.
Kerry, however, stressed that the NSA was a power of good and that many lives were saved by its surveillance operations.
He added, “We have to do with a new world in which people are ready to burst themselves into the air.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is committed to killing people, exploding into the air and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to stop and stop this before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators will travel to Europe to scatter the concerns against alleged American spy and convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the United States in the anti-terror efforts, the chairman of the Senate Undercommittee for European Affairs said Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he spoke this week with representatives of the European Parliament and others and is concerned about their threats to no longer participate in anti-terror organizations due to the surveillance of the National Security Agency’s frustration.
"It is very important for the US national security interests that the Europeans remain on board in terms of our common efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who sits as a democrat for the first time in the Senate and is chairman of the Senate Undercommittee for Foreign Relations and European Affairs in an interview in Washington.
Furthermore, I am going to Europe to clarify that we have to continue to work together in combating terrorism, regardless of their anguish over the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe have burdened relationships with some US allies, although the head of the intelligence service said this week that the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents transmitted by Snowden that the NSA monitored the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
Head of national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended the spying of allies as necessary and explained that this was common on both sides.
In all the tumults, Murphy said, his authority prepared the Congress’s journey to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation will include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route is still being developed.
While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the journey was to improve relationships, he also said that there would be a few "most-word" words.
He said that European governments should be honest to their population about the type of spying programs they have implemented themselves for years.
“We can change our surveillance programs and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also have to agree with the fact that we are not the only ones spiying,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry will take a trip to the Middle East and Poland on weekends to deal with the angry over the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as the U.S. surveillance activities.
A constant injury to the jump joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga outward game of the FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is committed by Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far he was able to do so only individually.
“We will decide on his commitment in the short term,” coach Thomas Tuchel said.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best gate shooters with six hits.
Because the Mainzers have already to renounce the injured power providers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australians appeal against prison sentences in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days prison in Phuket because she mistakenly claimed to be raped by a taxi driver, appealed against the judgment and was released on deposit.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a province court in Phuket on June 15th to have made a fake exhibition after reporting to the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning Sunday, June 10th, while two other men held her.
Later, however, the shootings of a video camera showed that she had securely entered her hotel after she was separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she managed to think about the story.
Until the trial, she was in police detention.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence at a low-security prison facility on the edge of Phuket rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former Australian Rubgy League player who went to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra with a request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about his daughter’s well-being and wanted to have her back to Australia.
"Of course, we're very concerned, but we hope she'll be home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50,000 baht on a free foot.
In Australian reports, it was to be read that in the meantime, she is making holidays in the resort of Krabi in South Thai.
From the court, Bamford was heard to be represented by a local attorney in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher penalty of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that Thailand could strive after the recent murder of traveler Michelle Smith in Phuket to improve his sought-after tourism image, and therefore comes to freedom.
