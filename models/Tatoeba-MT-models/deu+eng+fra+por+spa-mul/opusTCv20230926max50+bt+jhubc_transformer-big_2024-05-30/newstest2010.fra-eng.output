Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo in Norway to spend 26 hours and be the fourth U.S. president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The diploma, medal and check of $1.4 million will be given to him, among others, for his exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration between nations.
The chief of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a loaded program.
He will first go to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then provides an interview with the King of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will experience his summit in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious reward.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, but only the third who will be awarded the prize in the committee.
The White House told us in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan during the award.
The president does not want to avoid this topic because he is aware that he receives this prize by being a president who currently leads a war in two countries.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units in Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to emphasize.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check of ten million Swedish crowns (about 1.1 million euros).
He wants to donate to charitable works, but he has not yet decided concretely which ones.
His programme will then take him and his wife to a banquet including the king and queen of Norway, the head of the government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at that price at the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling of not deserving it fully.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for himself alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As of the announcement, he said that it would be an "invitation to act" for him.
A defender of nature accused of blackmail
The police of Litoměřice charged the president of the Association Société des protecteurs de la nature de Litoměřice with blackmail.
Repeatedly last year, he appealed for several construction procedures and requested money from investors for his personal benefit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokesman for Litoměřice police.
The president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and is at risk of up to three years in prison.
Waste sourcing beans are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort its drink packaging, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on sort beans at every corner of street.
What about Brno?
There, you need to take several minutes before finding the appropriate wells.
I don't mean we wouldn't sort the waste at all in Brno.
But I feel that the municipal counselors in our city, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is at the stone age of waste sort not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially because of the number of waste bens.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle into the city center?
It is a whole science, which especially requires steel time and nerves.
The only place I have found at the moment is the place of Moravia in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues do not want me, but it seems pretty little to me.
Not to mention that in other neighborhoods of the city it is not a synecure either.
So in the end, many of my friends don’t sort their waste.
Paress.
It makes them a trouble to get to the beans.
I'm not surprising about them.
I myself, after a party, proposed to go to throw a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I haven’t seen any Kounicova street colour beans.
Luckily, did I find the right place by going to take the tram?
In other words, the waste was overflowing.
This is after all the center of Brno, who is supposed to represent the city best, right?
It is probably that ecology and supposed aesthetics are not too interested in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy in the city a first place of hockey league that shames the city throughout the country, instead of buying a few additional beans and offering the sort of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I’m happy to have been able to comfort my impression with official statistics after dragging a moment on the internet.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravia region.
Paroubek's budget has taken off retirement and illness leave
After the left has increased, despite the government’s opinion, farmers or officials, there may be a lack of money for retirement, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interests on the debt of the State or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, Finance Minister Eduard Janota said.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed increases for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will borrow for sensitive expenditure, retirement, or illness leave. "It's just removing the problems later, mining the ground," Janota said.
It is important to be aware that on borrowed money the interest to pay is increasingly higher and that early or later it will have to be returned.
The state doesn’t really have the choice to know where to get money.
If it does not lower social aid or expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all who the left is currently increasing: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later, to their children.
People will touch them and should not be afraid for their retirement or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a greater debt of the state - next year therefore it will not be missing 163 billion in the boxes, but more.
Despite Minister Janota’s efforts, the debt will grow increasingly and with it, interest-related expenditures.
The state will need money to repay it and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or decrease maternity leave as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
It will also be missing five billion to complete constructions of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to a few voting groups.
These are mainly sections already decided and started, which cannot be modified in order to eventually reduce costs.
At least keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stoping thirty large plants, and European funds are also at risk, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, spokesman of the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to resolve the financial deficit with great advantage - it will draw from the dividends of the ČEZ (electric energy supplier and distributor), which the state has mostly and will supply the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividend is never certain and that it is in no way a bottom-free puit.
Last year, 18 billion have been navigated from ČEZ to budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, supplement pension accounts, or serve as a reserve for the prepared pension reform.
In addition, this trick increases the actual budget deficit by 5.7 percent of GDP according to EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the carnival of transfers.
The budget for various compensation to victims of communism and crimes, or even housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without that money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save the department’s side or, in the worst case, reach the government’s budget reserve.
There is also a lack of hundred million of the State Cash project worth two billion, which must allow for online monitoring the expenditures of each administration.
The first step will start in January.
If the Finance Minister did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans will consider a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing one button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
Just one button and you pass from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the U.S. company VMware, which focuses primarily on the development of computer virtualization software.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can change each other, you can differentiate them in personal and professional
Both will work at the same time, VMware’s Srinivas Krishnamurti said in an interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and a first demonstration was made a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is none of fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, with a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a Nokia N800 modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously runs the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is growing.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to current devices in 2012.
Snow shortage in mountains troubles hoteliers
The deserted tracks are no problem only for riding-plane operators.
The lack of snow dissuades people from booking their ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, it is always possible to discover free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Internet users search the offers, request the prices but do not dare to make a reservation at the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask whether there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in Špindlerův Mlýn, it is better not to hesitate to book too much.
If you prioritize the savings and the quality of the accommodation only comes afterwards, then you can try to wait for a few days.
The hoteliers in Špindler are currently only offering a week’s stay for the New Year.
I think they’re going to try another time to place them, but they’ll pass themselves and accept shorter periods too.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura estimated.
The tourism agency Ingtours du Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
Christmas week is most interested in us at the moment, it is not completely sold.
There is still free, let’s say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That’s why we’ve already prepared a few cheaper last minute Christmas stays,” said Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourism agency can also offer the New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February depart just as well, the remaining winter stays are sold averagely.
This year, the interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to begin to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks cover during the week, Christmas will also be complete,” Schiefert says.
On the contrary, the occupation of the hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few latest places for the New Year as well as for Christmas.
There is a great interest during the January holidays of the Polish and February is also well selling itself," said Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central parking of Jánské Lázně is also complete at ninety-percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by January, where we already have sixty percent of occupation today.
February is a little lower for the moment, but as soon as the snow falls, the interest in stays in the Krkonoše will certainly still grow, said hotel director Erik Sporysch.
However, Krkonoše hoteliers should not hope for more snow.
Thursday it will be cooler and if there is rainfall, they should be snow in the mountains.
But later, the weather is expected to warm up, reports Jiří Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
US: Repetition is a mother of wisdom
It even becomes comic, the steadfast effort with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of wise, reproduces his predecessor’s strategy on the Afghan issue, which he considered himself as simple.
When he eventually let his doctrine sweat so brightly expected, it turned out that he had copied it with carbon paper since the Iraqi Bush scenario three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the term "like in Iraq", he did not hesitate, which is more, to use the title of the January 2007 Bush speech as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush’s idea of sending new reinforcements to an Iraq consumed by civil war as “irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences.”
The following months showed, however, that Bush’s strategy, which emanates from the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely to be so successful that currently newspapers do not speak at all about Iraq.
This did not improve Bush’s reputation, that says, objectively speaking, he left his successor a much more favorable final situation than we could hope.
Barack Obama hopes in Afghanistan the miracle will repeat
The campaign commanders once again asked him for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the reticences of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men to make the situation more favorable.
The president hesited for three months, but in the absence of a better option, he deceived the general of at least 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to remove the promise of additional 5,000 from Europe, although it was originally up to 10,000.
What seems to lead to the most problems throughout Obama's strategy is his intention to withdraw the Afghan armies within 18 months and finish this entire process within three years, and the whole Obama's doctrine leads to more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that a half increase will bring the same fruits as progression in Iraq.
Despite the fratrician wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation is distinguished by the exact opposite - no one can rely on anyone and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leadership daily according to what they arrange.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only powder in the eyes behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is uniquely complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups, given the lack of clarity in relation to the reports, which are still complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "fast state to act", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy makes it perplexed by its voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the edge of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of reality can be convinced that the small soldiers sent into the tumultuous war for their "prompt return to home" will bring there a true miracle.
From a political point of view, defining a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will consider it the indirect evidence of the American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the Europeans’ willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is oriented towards the negative.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and reinforced sanctions have no effect on Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult question of resolving the problem through the use of military force.
For example, it will have to be answered when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of Afghanistan troops.
Each solution of this kind, however, will lead to a dramatic turning of the Afghan situation.
The only rustine for Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for him to board a new strategy, in the event that it would prove to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs bank leaders will no longer receive cash prizes
U.S. bank Goldman Sachs senior leaders will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company announced it to respond to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to sell back until five years.
The actions may be withdrawn from leaders in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus leading the effort to connect remuneration with long-term performance at Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the global sense to be taken, said former investment bankier Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan.
The concern is in detail, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank has become the target of criticism after dropping aside nearly $17 billion for premiums for the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total premiums will likely exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, Reuters said.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, the strong premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political subject in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it is expected to allocate a single tax of fifty percent of bankers’ bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds.
France prepares similar measures.
This year women won Nobel prizes in all areas besides physics.
These are five women, a record number, who today have received Nobel Prize from the hands of King Charles XVI Gustave in technical and literature disciplines in Stockholm.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, received the Nobel Prize of Medicine with their compatriot Jack Szostak for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry award was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosoms
The latest winner received the Nobel Economic Award, American Elinor Ostrom with his compatriota Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have a winner this year was physics.
This award was today given to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith withWillard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently at the base of all digital cameras, fax or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the monetary reward.
It reached ten million Swedish crowns in each category. (about 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward among themselves.
The highly expected Nobel Peace Prize has already been handed over to Oslo this afternoon to U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he recognized the controversial nature of his reward as he is only at the beginning of his course and is also the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
To the discharge of his policy he added that in certain situations war is essential to obtain peace, even though the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who weighs his stay in the government due to his disagreement with the state budget for next year as he has been voted by the House of Deputies.
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also Janota's position in the firm will be on the agenda of their Friday appointment.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which increases the crisis of public finances.
Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss her role Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be subject to Klaus' signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Parliamentarians validated Wednesday the left's proposals on money transfers and increased the remuneration of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government rejected the proposals of the Social Democrats that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement is born between the left, on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right, on the other hand, which challenges the future of the Fischer's cabinet which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, ČSSD and the Party of Greens.
Criticians say that the budget, as has been voted by the MEPs, removes the package of savings measures passed by the government of Fischer, which he believes must deduct the debt of the State.
Klaus, who can ratify the State Budget Act but that nothing requires it, today during a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs, said that policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irrespectable deficiency" of public finance.
Now, he believes, there is no favorable solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement if it could rely on a broader consensus of political parties, the president said.
ODS Chairman Mirek Topolánek said the budget is sharp and the government should challenge its subsequent existence.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an administrative firm supported by ČSSD, ODS and Greens does not work clearly anymore.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer called such words “drastic verdicts”.
Chief of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government is scary and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, ČSSD has called the ratification of the State budget for the next year as a success.
The People’s Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman is going to play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans say that the new Hollywood Invictus - Invaincu film will expose the world many things about the country, its fights and its victories.
The story is about sport, race relationships and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, American actor awarded the Oscars, incarnates the film on Nelson Mandela's life, a tireless fighting against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and first black president.
Freeman said it was a ninety-one-year-old Mandela who asked him to incarnate him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, “If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally.
The seventy-twelve-year-old actor who was awarded a prize for her role in Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby drama in the middle of the boxing has, for example, incarnated the leader of a movement against slavery becoming himself slave, a fictional president of the United States, or even God for the Evan Almighty, but never.
The former South African state man was imprisoned 27 years for his hard work in favor of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning invincu and it is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unite the country. President Mandela knows that his country remains still divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He is convinced to be able to unite his people through sport and decides to unite rugby players who are among outsiders in the world rank.
The South African team will eventually progress in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman has worked a few years to bring Mandela’s story to a large screen.
I had no other goal otherwise to play this role in a way that brings him closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was, of course, to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to stick his hand.
I realized that when I hold your hand, I recover your energy, it transmits itself and I felt like you know how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor said he was six months to prepare for a role in the hard middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I knocked at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I told Francois Pienaar was, 'I look much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the differences between actors and real models, Invictus under the headline of director Eastwood received positive opinions and we even talk about ambitions for the Oscars.
The Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summarized his appreciation in these words: "This is a very good story, a very well-directed film."
In movie reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive assessments.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is resolved: Russians tested a rocket
A strange light phenomenon of unknown origin was observed above Norway.
The Russian Department of Defense has only tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket far from the Norwegian borders.
The launch, however, has still been a failure and the Bulava-like missile which initially had to be the pride of the Russian army gradually becomes the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during the tests of the rocket did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava did not fly or damaged itself in full flight.
Russian newspapers talk about “Bulava” like “missile that doesn’t steal”
A missile that doesn’t fly but shines
This 13th trial was carried out normally at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was damage to the equipment again.
It is clearly the engine on the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" fled from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be just fired from a boat in motion and immersed.
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object precisely was probably defective by a "Bulava".
Norwegians did not doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot talk absolutely about failure.
The first two floors of the rocket resisted and the avarie only touched the third.
In previous cases, the motors have experienced failures on the first floor.
Although none of the trial launches had gone without a crackdown, the Department of Defence executive considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This nearly fifty percent success rate therefore fills the generals of optimism and therefore they always say that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will even carry ten hypersonic nuclear cores with a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetissov signed one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at age 51
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will be presented again in a professional match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder, will lend strong to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably enter the Friday match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at forty years in 1998, is currently the president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to resolve some details about the form, says club coach Sergey Nyemtchinov, cited by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the legendary hockey player’s comeback will only affect a single match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mind of other players, Nyaemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return on the ice, Fetissov thus becomes the eldest professional Russian hockey player.
At NHL, legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and won 15 goals and 26 assistance.
The eldest of the famous Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those with the most success.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union he won twice the gold at the Olympics, seven World Championships, he won the Canada Cup as well as the junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected tributes at NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Fame Temple since 2001.
Hyundai listened to trade unions and cancelled every extra hour
The management of the Hyundai factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was just due to frequent overtime that trade unions reported an emergency strike on Monday.
Hyundai's spokesman Petr Vaněk confirmed it.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday working again this year.
We cannot renounce our production plan, it is essential, that's why voluntary overhours were proposed on Saturday, December 19, knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
Sedmička.cz said the company offered a Czech bonus of 400 crowns to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be awarded post-season for the worked day on November 28.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for additional hours, either they can place a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their end-of-year holidays indicated Vaněk.
In addition to this, all employees present on Saturday will receive a compensation for transportation costs and for lunch.
Given the fact that overtime was the most urgent and hot point in comments and claims from trade unions as employees who spontaneously ceased production last week, the management took the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, car plant employees were forced to work almost two extra hours daily in addition to their eight hours.
The trade unions are planning to cancel the strike state after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the automotive plant management and trade unions will take place Friday afternoon.
Union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were willing to stop the state of strike in the event of agreement on their claims and signature of a common document.
The situation in the plant culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously strike due to incessant additional hours.
They also protested against poor wage conditions and alleged bizutages.
The management defended itself with the fact that employees needed to work in addition to fulfill the requirements for car production.
During the announcement of the Monday strike, trade unions also asked that employees who have ceased production are not subject to any penalties.
The trade unions call on the company to reduce time spent in overtime at a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a remuneration of 5,000 crowns (209 €) for these.
Hyundai car plant in Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
She started series production last year in November.
It manufactured around 80,000 vehicles until September this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars a year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "durable" HIV viruses too
A team of Czech and German scientists tests new combinations that can slow the proliferation of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality takes, in some cases, the top of the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as certain medications already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the moment.
However, life of patients can be radically extended through a mixture of medications that prevent the multiplication of HIV virus in the body.
Their consumption, however, leads to a number of side effects.
Furthermore, the repression of this multiplication has an effect on the development of so-called resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Czech Academy of Sciences, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to a way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metallocarborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are a bore, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt assembly.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all drugs used so far and that’s why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers’ work leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their virus protein bonds.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-wall cages are formed by the bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A betraying and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a HIV protein that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV division caused by HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus into the patient’s body will also be stopped, researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic and Biochemistry of the Czech Republic Academy of Sciences.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (cf. table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little lower but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in tests as well as its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-contaminated patients.
On the common version of the enzyme, the effect of metallocarborans is not as strong as on clinical medications, however, it does not faint on the resistant versions against which common medications are often ineffective.
Metalocarborans, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are therefore interesting combinations to examine more towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčova, director of the bio- and chemical laboratory.
Dispute around the budget. The ODS takes up Fischer, who defends himself
Chairman of the ODS (Civil Democratic Party), Mirek Topolánek, called the ratified budget for the next year as "effarant" and he said that the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should challenge his existence.
The prime minister described the ODS as a drastic judgment.
He says he takes some time to analyze.
ODS spokesman Petr Nečas said the idea of an administrative firm supported by ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of the Government should decide whether he is to teach the House of Parliamentary Members supporting the minority that is concerned with fighting the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned with remaining in his duties with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the ODS and Social Democrats’ positions in relation to the issue of public deficits are diametrally opposed.
The House of Parliamentarians ratified the budget for 2010 on Wednesday, however, the proposals for amendments of 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The Chamber has increased the money for official salaries, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grief towards the proposals of social democrats was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room prior to the vote, thus obeying the government's wish as a changed budget is a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of uselessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will still reflect on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave her duties in the event of ratification of proposals for amendments, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota held a meeting Monday with the Prime Minister after his move to the government:
At the same time he said he was wondering whether he was going to stay in his office.
His disappointment about the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Nečas believes that ČSSD representatives, who imposed the changes in the budget, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also clearly say that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws increasing the deficit, such as those affecting health insurance, pensions, or service law reform.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the case of the head of the Fischer government and the entire government.
Ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing harmful, Topolánek said in a statement from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some departments claim TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decided to give his resignation in the face of a fight against the amount of the public finance deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left majority that is currently in the House."
In other words, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I didn't think about it and once it's going to be on the agenda, then I'll devote myself to it, said the Chamber to journalists, Defence Minister Martin Barták, elected to the government just by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer fled in the afternoon for a debate by the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS has gone back at the request of the Prime Minister.
At the same time, Nečas stressed that the ODS probably would have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not expressly requested Democratic members to allow the vote of the budget.
We do not feel orphans, we are not small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not been reproached by the President of the Party in the House or in the country during negotiation of the budget.
I did not notice that my vote would have been missing.
I already knew when I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a Bolshevitation of the House and a destruction of all positive, Topolánek reacted in person.
According to the new ČD schedules, there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit some less loaded or regional express trains from December 13 and strengthen some other trains.
The total coverage of transportation will decrease on the day of new times entry into force by two percent compared to today.
Most rates will not change, including basic rates and reduced rates.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino branch.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be dramatically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transportation relates to the Hradec Králové region by a total of eight percent, but Prague and its surroundings may be excited.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - České Budějovice line are also cancelled and the traffic of a few express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will decrease to just a few days in the week.
Among the greatest transformations, we can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: at the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburb system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distance lines towards the capital will have their final destination at the main train station of Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will depart by intervals of two hours.
Travelers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino until Bratislava from December 13.
The bill this year for regional railways: 200 million additional crowns.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways next year in all four billion crowns to repair visible losses, which is the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate in almost three billion.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways recently signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not use a price rise in the vast majority of transport securities.
The changes will only affect one-day ČD Net tickets and eLiška internet tickets at a discount.
For travellers without discount card, ČD Net’s price will rise from 450 to 600 crowns.
eLiška’s price will newly depend on the journey, while so far it was valid between cities in a region of choice and at a unique rate of 160 crowns.
Philippine rebels always retain more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels today kidnapped 75 people south of the Philippines, including a few students from a primary school and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency who informed it, but who spoke about only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
Hostages were taken in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used hostages as human shields during a flight from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the rebels belong to the New Popular Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police first prosecuted the kidnappers as a result of violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in southern Philippines because of a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November related to the elections of the Governor's administration, there were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province of the South Philippines was arrested as a result of suspicion of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential line of the Ampatuan.
The island Mindanao also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa relates to everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood’s new Hollywood film arrives in the US halls in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates a part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fighter against world-known apartheid returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to incarnate it.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was awarded to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in rooms, the feedback of critics and the public is heard.
Nelson Mandela
From his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, and in 1993 he then received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is fully prepared for the World Cup of Football, and on the other hand because the media is agitated by worrying news about the growing racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants of the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, the reactions to the new film are currently rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reserves issued towards the main roles where Hollywood stars "pave".
Morgan Freeman is, however, proud of the movie.
I dreamed of this long-term role and prepared myself well.
I have also met Nelson Mandela many times personally to be able to recover from his energy, he said at the first official film in Los Angeles.
I think it’s a good thing if you have the ability to remember through the film Mandela’s personality and message.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it relates to each individual, he added.
Wear the National Rugby Team Shirt
The film based on the history of the novel of the British writer John Carlin the title is being freely translated in the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the piece that gave its creation to the people depicts the South African defender of human rights during his presidency mandate.
Morgan Freeman is therefore trying to pick up two racial groups from a long-divided population, and as Nelson Mandela in 1995, who entered the South African team’s national suit on the World Cup grass, which South Africa had won then.
To be shown on the suit grass, which is considered in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been long ovationed fourteen years ago mainly white public and was recognized by white populations.
Let's hope the football championship will succeed in uniting people again into a single nation, rugby player Chester Williams said, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
It remains to see if the tense South African situation will improve.
South African whites, however, are skeptical as recently entrusted in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship started on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flame in the region of Louny
A fire swallowed in the morning a transformator of the Čeps company from the distribution center near the municipality of Vyškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, a spokesman for Ústi firefighters, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally counted to let the transformator consume, but they reviewed their opinions and turned off the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short-circuit of the transformator.
No one was injured and, according to the spokesman of the company Pavla Mandátova, the incident does not endanger the secure operation of the transmission assembly.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact number may be known once the fire is turned off.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a nine.
It added that in ten years of activity, the Čeps company has nothing similar to it and that such incidents are isolated.
Electric current supplies have not been interrupted, said ČEZ's spokesman for Northern Bohemia Soňa Holingerova Hendrichova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission assemblies and electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transportation assemblies to distribution assemblies and line traces of a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jančura will file a complaint for defamation against three prefects of ČSSD
Radim Jančura, the owner of the Student Agency, is going to file a complaint for defamation against three Democratic social prefects.
And concretely against Michal Hašek from the region of South Moravia, against Radko Martinka from the region of Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík.
Jančura indicated it in Dvacet minut of Radiožurnal.
The complaint is related to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions have finally signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three attacked us and claim that we are made fine mouths, while we have made only an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So we just remain to defend ourselves.
This is in exchange for calumnies on the Student Agency company, Jančura told Radiožurnal.
Similarly, he said it has evidence that no region has made it in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for this to the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr. Jančura’s complaint represents the sequence of his media show that serves him as free advertising for his company and for his person.
I am of course willing to defend my name and the name of my region, and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose that this will be an opportunity to clearly demonstrate that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and false arguments about regional rail transport, Hašek said.
Jančura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertising that will mention the adverse steps of the regions.
He told Radiožurnal that he stopped the campaign after Christmas and that he plans to resume it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will target corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura started its campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways to operate railways for an order of approximately 150 billion crowns without tenders.
According to Jančura, such a way of action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even brought Jančura to the threats of a ČSSD member.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of ČSSD, I don't know who it is, but I won't say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnal today.
Pneumococcus vaccination will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcus will overthrow old habits as of January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Votes already rise, saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcus culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that the health insurance will pay.
Specialists also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for August children.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcus.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination began last year or earlier, the following vaccinations must be paid for itself.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcus.
Yet the parents paid 1600 crowns or even more for a dose.
The vaccination of young people requires four doses.
Specialists estimate that health insurance spends 300,000 to 450,000 crowns in vaccine doses each year.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
Until now, the state spent approximately 500,000 crowns a year for all children's vaccination.
The refund vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcus are the cause of inflammations in the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammations in the meninge and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, there are up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age caused by pneumococcal infections.
In addition to the Czech Republic, approximately 40 other countries have introduced the refund vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are notices regarding any vaccination obligation in the future.
As of January, it must be settled by insurance and optional.
For example, the chairman of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that a mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcus.
At an international conference to which our association took part, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have imposed at least this.
I think this is a direction to be followed now, Kalovský said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are absolutely not considering it at the moment, his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň said.
Optional vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, Chairman of the Specialized Society of Pediatricians, acknowledges that a volunteer-based vaccination of its defects.
If all children were vaccinated, it could be considered a decrease in vaccination renewals "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum, I understand the decision making the vaccination optional," however Cabrnochová said.
Specialists predict that more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their infants as early as next year.
Vaccination against pneumococcus also marks a break because it is the first child vaccination that is funded by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, thus saving on potential future medical care.
Doctors must buy their products themselves.
However, this is related to the concerns of pediatricians, which concern the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to purchase vaccines by insurance, physicians receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products supplied by the State.
Some members feared, however, that this would allow insurances to "deduct the amounts of health insurance."
Thus, doctors will need to buy the products and wait until the insurance pay them back.
According to estimates, pediatricians will need to individually invest nearly 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Vol"
Frank Frazetta’s son, a recognized illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings for a value of $20 million ($12 million) in his father’s museum.
In Pennsylvania, police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested as he loaded 90 paintings in his vehicle and a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shell to force the entrance to the museum in the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbara and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the news agency Associated Press (AP).
AP cited a police officer that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family dispute.
According to a police statement, 52-year-old Frazetta Jr claims he was authorized by her father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings into a storage facility," the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior has never given such a permission, the agency said.
Labour defends the increase in budgetary tax.
The Ministers defended the increased tax and expenditure reductions announced in the prebudget report, despite criticism of opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling “missed” an opportunity to show that he was serious about the decrease of the deficit by deferring his decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted lightning by attacking low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals, we can see an increase of 0.5% in Social Insurance and a ceiling rate of 1% on public wages from 2011.
The Anger of Social Insurance
The trade unions protested that low wages are punished by a recession they are not responsible for and warned that "problems" were announced.
The decrease in the social insurance – which will achieve approximately GBP 3 billion a year – has put the world of businesses angry, because it believes that it is a job tax while the goal should be a recovery of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than £20,000 a year, will reach about 10 million workers.
PRE-BUDGET RAPPORT PRINCIPALE POINTS
Social Insurance will further increase by 0.5% from April 2011
Economy will decrease more than 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on bankers’ bonuses
Increased corporate profit tax for small companies has been abandoned
Discounts of taxes for electric cars and wind turbines
Retirement increase by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, one winner GBP 30,000 will lose 90 GBP per year and one winner GBP 40,000 will lose 190 GBP, while one winner GBP 10,000 per year will earn 110 GBP more.
The ministers said their goal to halve the deficit before 2013 was "tough decisions" but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would weigh on the first 5% of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Treasury Secretary, rejected an increase in tax and stressed that a decrease in expenditure was a "water drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
“These figures are important, and they will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely indispensable over the next four years,” he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident and the growth of the economy would begin again in the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for economic growth - which will influence the amount it will be borrowed and the speed to which the deficit will be fulfilled - were doubted after the Chancellor was forced to revise its first figures.
In his speech, he said the economy would probably decrease by 4.75% this year - much worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than the previous estimate.
"Opportunity missed"
Conservatives who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday warning against Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the project to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
The ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay money, they added, electing "cynically" difficult choices until after the elections - which will be held in June 2010.
"They didn't show anything meaningful about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary of the Ghost Cabinet Treasury. "They had the opportunity to do so and they missed it."
“The important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour emphasizes that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from the next reductions, unlike Tory’s proposals that would lead to a faster and more significant deficit decrease.
But the Lib Dems claimed that money harvested due to the increase in taxes and the decrease in expenditure would be used to support next year’s expenditure rather than to reduce the deficit, supporting that the plans were “built on wind.”
Nick Robinson, BBC’s political editor, said the calendar of announcements – such as the increase in inflation for certain invalidity benefits next April, mentioned above – would leave the Chancellor face propaganda accusations, the money simply being recovered the following year.
However, the Labour insists on the fact that additional assistance is provided while people need it most and the situation will be revised in September 2010.
"Fake budget"
Although ministers did not publish expenditure details beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that public expenditure restrictions would only begin to feel in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Fiscal Studies Institute) stated that the Chancellor's figures in the future involve substantial reductions in many areas, including potentially transportation, higher education, science and defence.
“The pain is actually only deferred,” said his Director, Robert Chote.
“The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner,” added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor at Deloitte’s accountants.
"This was a false prebudget report. The markets are well aware of it."
FBI investigates "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest of five American reporters suspected of extremist ties in Pakistan.
The men were arrested during a raid in a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether they were the same men who were declared missing from their home in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descendance, one of Egyptian legacy and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would wish to know what charges are against them and under what conditions they are held," said Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said the agency had known about the arrests and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We work with Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature of their activities there, and whether they are actually the students who are being held missing," she said.
The Pakistan Embassy in Washington claimed that the men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of them.
She said the house was already monitored by the local police and no charge had yet been charged against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused any comments on arrests, Reuters reported, but stated that the United States needs to "better collaborate with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to deracise the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were missed from their home by their families, in North Virginia, late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian abuse
In the last twenty years, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to the report of Amnesty International.
The report presents “repetitions of violations” by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One mentioned in the report claimed that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he had been threatened to rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism regarding its failure to respect human rights.
The authorities have stated that such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran, after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens were sentenced to prison sentences and prosecutors claim that at least five people were sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, claims that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei recognized some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, said our correspondent.
"Fausse confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the results of the election.
"They often struck me in the face," he said.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, in my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still in blood and half awareness, Amnesty said.
In August, the election losing candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied charges of rape, but admitted abuse had occurred.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he was locked in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial apparatus create a committee to investigate post-election disorders and the government's response, but stated that the mandate and powers of these bodies were not clear and that the results of the parliamentary committee were not made public.
The group said at least 90 people were arrested over the past three weeks with the aim of preventing other demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to transform the Bristol site into a track for competition.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 skiers and semi-professional snowboarders competing for cash prices.
At the top of the Brandon Hill park track, a small trap preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth year medical student, said the view from the top of the track was beautiful but that it was quite intimidating.
It is a beautiful view, with all the lights of the city shining down.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowborders in the country - real talents," he added.
Prices have rewarded the best scores - or figures made on the track.
After the Thursday night party, the snow will be left to the fountain.
Always they and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's last book, "Why the French don't like the slope" (2006), an elegant and well documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for a fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
The last book of Mr. Bowen presents a much broader and more ambitious framework.
Good anthropologist, he does not only want to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country now.
He has spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He is able to listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Does a Muslim have to marry in a mosque or town hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and the rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use a interest-based banking system to get a loan?
These are the practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen generally agree with their counterparts attorneys of a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, which today constitute a small part of Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularity of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wonders how much French politicians (and the so virulent intellectual elite of secularism) are actually committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not damaged, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular Republicanism.
Instead of increasing pragmatism, it detects a "narrowness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is attempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic changes faster and more dramaticly than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, carrying with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fishing navigate in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their seat.
In "On a thin layer of ice," Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, painted a natural story of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
Knowing the history and complicated whale fishing policies, he described the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by hunting the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous 14-year-old aspiring who had to fight only the tip of his mosquito, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while swimming alongside their mother, just killed, were captured and sent to zoos and circles.
In the early 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are usually always one millionth of the surface required for an adult in freedom. the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to the algae that grow in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often comes back to the threat of hunters on species survival.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and motorski Inuit Indians use powerful assaults to hunt their wildlife.
Ironicly, it is in the northernmost waters of these two nations that the ice will remain longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating insight into what perhaps the future will be there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospherists nor oceanographers can accurately relate the speed of changes.
It's not a fault to try.
Late 19th and early 20th, the pioneering trips of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information about the melting of the glacier calotte.
Cold War submarines then mapped the relief changes.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but the biggest of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice-dependent system, formed by the pressed salmaster water grids by frosting.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the summer ice disappearance, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, this may be our turn.”
Marines, among the 6,000 people who placed crowns on the tombs in Arlington
The first class De'Angello Robinson, 19, made a seven-hour trip by bus to place a simple crown on the tomb of a soldier he never met.
For him and for the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina at the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the tombs, this day was dedicated to greetings of men and women who one day were in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we are at risk of being in their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I would like someone to do the same for me, that's why I just try to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers to have gathered Saturday morning to place crowns on the graves of the veterans, in different sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration, and other people decided to decorate several hundred tombs at the Arlington Cemetery.
Now, to continue a 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the journey every year, stoping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the tombs of the Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the tombs of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the memorial for the victims of the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation gave more than $150,000 to buy and carry the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she had traveled to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased career military.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way to thank those who had sacrificed himself.
This is a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
Emmituffled in several layers of hot clothing, volunteers walked between the grasslands and the extended hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers have chosen ancient graves, dating from the First and Second World War, as well as from the Vietnam War, because they are not as often visited as the new graves, the organizers said.
The mood was in optimism, while the children played and the couples stood by hand, wearing fresh pine crowns on grey graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly node on top.
Closely, he planned silence on Section 60, where most veterans of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of current wars filled the area.
Individuals were crying without hiding, others prayed and families and friends supported themselves in the cold air.
Some read loudly the names engraved in the stone while others were looking to see the small black and white information cards, dropped in the wetland for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears, on her son’s grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio, and led eight hours to come to the tomb of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in the fight in July.
Nobody should never forget thanks to what we are free... my son paid for that, she said.
“A long time after I’ve gone, I want someone to remember him.”
American citizen arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government detained a U.S. citizen who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana tried to have access to the prisoner who was arrested on 5 December.
The accusations have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, lead to the risk of arrest.
Anti-governmental graffiti and speeches are considered to be serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are husband and are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to get awards, but authorizations have always been denied.
The detention of an American citizen may increase tensions between the Communist brothers’ government in Cuba and the Obama administration that continues a "soft" approach to improve relationships with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government advances by concrete steps, such as liberating political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the United States can make the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country or the average wage of an official is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a wage day.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to connect often have to communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most few Americans detained in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, press attached to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention is a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- to distribute mobile phones for free -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Programme Americas of Human Rights Watch, who recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba," referring to the installation of Raul Castro as a sick leader in the country, Fidel.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, judged and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction to the United States, when both countries begin to start better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent plot to send men to Afghanistan
Saturday, Pakistan’s authorities found a supposed organization to prepare a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan with the aim of killing American troops, saying they hoped that this matter would demolish an important network of recruiters of terrorists looking for radicalized young men.
The investigators claimed they are chasing a hidden insurgent personality known as Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
When they arrived in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote region of Pakistan’s tribal belt, al-Qaeda home and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistani Secret Services who was informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not involved in the CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far from the prohibited northeast mountains became a refuge for terrorism.
They were considered infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed itself on the condition of keeping anonymous due to the confidentiality of the case.
The representative of the authorities claimed that men were determined and that they were still trying to obtain the authorizations necessary to enter the al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law forces.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and who are interrogated by the FBI -- insist on the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential and perhaps more important terrorists, in determining those who trust.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. Secret Services have prioritized infiltrating men into the al-Qaeda network.
The organization’s recruiters play the role of barrier guards, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
According to analysts, potential American recruits are closely studied by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups must also be increasingly attentive, in recent years in choosing people they accept because U.S. secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model that so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen call for "climate action"
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked on the streets here on Saturday, asking for a more significant action on the climate by negotiators working in the Bella Convention Center Congress Palace in the city.
The number of demonstrators was estimated to be 100,000, but 25,000, according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists turned on some explosives near a set of government buildings in the center of town.
On the day that few things happened during the climate discussions sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists walked throughout the city, deploying pancarts in English saying ‘There is no planet B’ and one in Spanish, declaring ‘The Earth says it has enough’.
Several celebrities have joined protests, including Danish top model and photographer, Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother’s home country, Peru, has opened her eyes to the crushing problems that the country must face due to the impact of climate change already happening.
"This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the great march -- to make the word passes and call on leaders around the world to make right, ambitious and committed decisions," she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella center and said she had arrested 19 people on the ground that they were wearing a mask or pocket knives.
Police prevented demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella center and said she had arrested 19 people on the ground that they were wearing a mask or pocket knives.
According to a passenger who asked to retain anonymity due to his involvement in climate discussions, activists wearing black masks and clothes turned on several explosives near the main Copenhagen channel which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They launched them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first the rockets, then followed by “some big explosions.”
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to follow the walk throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that protesters failed to awaken the consciousness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China’s climate representative.
When asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he answered in English: "In fact, this is something I didn't know.
He then continued in Mandarin, declaring “Because the event is important, I cannot hear what is happening outside.”
He observed that the walk could seem harmful or useful according to perspectives.
It shows the interest of the general public and the various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, “you can also say that they disturb the negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others.”
Test results reveal steady differences between races
Last week’s federal report on mathematics results brought good news to Washington DC public schools.
Although the District still remains far behind the head facilities, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much greater progress over the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress) are the persistent gap between the results of African Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average results of white children from Grade 4 (cm1) in Washington D.C. have increased, over the past two years, from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have increased only by three points, from 209 to 212.
Success gap has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) usually remains constant, falling only from one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white result was not included in the test results because the sample was not sufficiently important.
The overview of a six-year period is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the difference between black and white in Class 4 (cm1), when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference only decreased to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) was driven by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in District education.
I don’t jump joy for one or two points earned, Kwame R. Brown (appearance Democratic), DC Council member and whose daughter is in Grade 4, to Eaton Elementary (elementary school).
Often critical of Rhee’s management style, Brown said that the test results message is that middle schools (colleges) in the city desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what makes it afraid is that we don’t dedicate enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of difficult students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at school students of the end classes of the elementary cycle and beginning of college who have not integrated the basis of reading earlier in their school course and who are quite late compared to their comrades.
Every day, the mathematics program, for Kindergarten (maternal) classes in Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real-life games and experiences, as they have been set up in the District by former manager Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply think we need to keep working to offer better interventions to these less-level students than in the class, Rhee said.
Others believe that the results of the NAEP are asking whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall system results while providing money and resources for schools with less good results to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teaching trainer at the University of Berkeley in California who study the results of the city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
This targeting can also have political consequences that disturb this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other superintendents of schools, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they are from, will be assured that their children will be able to obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the success gap was the duration of the traditional public school, today 180 days in the Washington District, to be competing with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of his teachers last year to get 185 days, that he considers a "start point" to get another increase in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise of Future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long siffling.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, descends and clinds a moment of eyes to the sight of the white columns, facades of bricks and green grass.
Graciela's parents had only been able to finish the high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, had never put her feet on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students of the group explored Gettysburg where the school fee was $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of a new impressed student than enthusiast.
This is where I’m going to study! exclaimed Graciela who wishes to study medicine, while the guide directed them to the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? said she, when she was indicated the low teacher ratio of law - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh visiting children during their three-day discovery journey and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not if you are going to university:
The question is where.
Although this question is still broadly asked for the large number of American children born from Hispanic immigrant parents who left the high school where they became parents at adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from academic education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a Spanish of the "second generation" on five follows his high school studies -- a remarkable success if one considers that so many of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without completing the high school.
Their success is important, researchers say, they open the way to the next generations that will play an important role in the country’s workforce.
Researchers who study beaters say they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach university -- in particular if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gandara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think of providing a network of support to these children, from nursing to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit to Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepare you), it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize university preparation programs that begin when low-income families students are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of the high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry Agreements with 10 Foreign Oil Companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil societies to rebuild its difficult infrastructure during two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements obtained by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies in China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the restoration of the Iraq oil industry, invalid by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies departed with a stake in only two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday.
The only one who put an auction lost.
Two U.S. companies have obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised the analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, it was Asian and European companies that open the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, a website of information on the Internet.
It will take a lot of time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Safety concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings and political instability, Tuesday, while U.S. military troops withdraw, have stopped U.S. oil companies, preventing them from more powerfully entering Iraq that has the third largest crude oil reserve in the world, analysts say.
In some cases, U.S. companies were disadvantaged due to their rivals, especially the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more ready to take risks because they had no responsibility for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and gave it their technical advice, have brought off empty hands.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the State, has more contracts than other companies and returned with significant stakeholders in contracts for two main fields.
We all know China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Oil, said.
We are confident that the Chinese society will be equal with its competitors and will fulfill its commitments in Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to submit auctions made offers which were then compared to the barrel rate that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above the current levels for each field.
One of the leading organizers of al-Qaeda was killed in Pakistan
It seems that a U.S. missile, hitting along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of al-Qaeda operations organizers this week, U.S. counterspionage authorities said Friday.
If the information was confirmed, this would be the second killer attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles had been fired by an unpilot aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside the anarchical tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, leading to the Afghan border, when the car was hit, a member of the Pakistani civilian secret services said, speaking at Miran Shah's phone.
Authority representatives said the suspected local activists have rushed on the spot and quickly confiscated what remained from the "fully discarded bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. anti-terrorism representatives gave unspecified evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
Somali was described as one of Al-Qaeda ' s military organizators who led the group ' s terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize plots around the world, one of the authorities that wanted to keep anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes within the Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic guidelines of al-Qaeda leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the U.S. authority said Somali had rapidly progressed in al-Qaeda's ranks and had very good relationships with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the general American public, but it does not reduce the threat it poses to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second important character of Al Qaeda or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a group of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has decreased since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to the numbers advanced by the Long War Journal, a moderate website by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also killing suspected informants, the site says.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul withdrew
UN Special Envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his position in March at the end of a tumultuous mandate of allegations of corruption extended during the UN-backed presidential elections.
Eide’s departure occurs when Obama’s administration decided to send additional 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations Envoy said he was supporting this increase but expressed concern about the U.S. calendar for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and that would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they may have trust in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials supporting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he would not resign but simply comply with the commitment he had made to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a substitute.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there had been a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has already begun looking for a substitute.
Representatives claim that the name Staffan di Mistura has been cited; it is an Italian-Swiss citizen who recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guehenno, a Frenchman who previously headed UN peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of promoting President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and hiding the evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he said that Galbraith's accusations -- which was thanked -- "have damaged the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism regarding international observation of elections."
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted with the United Nations Responsible to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than he is attributed to the Afghanistan mission, saying that this would give them more confidence on how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration about the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that heavy UN hiring regulations disturbed his opportunities to bring new talents.
The UN rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must submit additional sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said on Friday that major world powers would soon impose “important additional sanctions” on Iran because of his inability to engage in talks about nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq during a week’s visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramated the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such a decay.
One of the most weighing things to me is that if I have learned something in Iraq over the past six years, this is the unpredictable side inherent in war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect street Iranians.
He said a “set of motivations and punishments” could be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be less good safe with nuclear weapons because “his people would suffer greatly” from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesman of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "like" consequences if it does not return its nuclear program in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its supervisory agency, the International Energy Agency (IEA).
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he said he would resume the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear program and agreed to give up a significant part of his enriched uranium storage in exchange for desperately necessary fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed such an agreement, a means of developing confidence on both sides and saving time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has appeared to be away from attempts to agree - in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on engaging with the United States or not.
I honestly believe that Iran's agitating against some of the international community's proposals for which they had actually agreed in early October, pushed the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join on what they had not considered in terms of major additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set December 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before he turned to other options, including the pursuit of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “increased sanctions.”
In a statement made Thursday in New York, Iran's United Nations mission denounced what it calls "groundless allegations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "to achieve a long-term satisfactory solution."
Gates, who was to return to Washington late Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before taking the plane for the rich oil region of Kurdish to meet the troops responsible in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions remain between the Kurdish and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly regarding borders, property rights and revenue sharing.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid all delays in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115 000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wishes to calm the anxiety of the Kurds about the suspended withdrawal. The US authorities cited Gates to Massoud Barzani, President of the regional government of Kurdistan: “We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.”
We will not leave you.”
In aging China, a change in direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda poster, “The Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children” and “A baby in addition, it’s a tomb in addition.”
They learned the lesson so well that Shanghai Government authorities, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and the aging of the population, have changed their direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was immediate and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to a single child.
There is no second left to us, 31-year-old Wang said, Director of Human Resources and who has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child's policy in China, creating two generations of knownly unique children with good cheeks and confused, called the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate dropped from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The population distribution, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and older will explode from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050, which is far above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and older represented nearly 22 percent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission) said that fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent lack of work in the future."
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
Progressive mitigation
Written in the constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of the single child is to date, undoubtedly, the most controversial obligation introduced by the Communist government.
Couples who violate this policy are likely to have to pay colossal fines — up to three times their annual income — and to have discrimination on the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have assigned the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend to its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in implementing this policy.
In rural areas, some authority representatives forced pregnant women from a second child to aborte.
In addition, many couples have used selective abortions leading to a ratio boys - girls abnormally high.
In recent years, population authorities have gradually softened their position on single child's policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for residents in cities, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which man and woman are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
Within no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to request authorization.
The city’s government sent family planners and volunteers to meet couples at home, and drag prospectus under their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who wish to have more than one child.
According to the family planning manager, the answer was disappointing.
Disappointing answer
Although officials in a rural city in the outskirts of Shanghai say they saw an increase in demands for couple records wishing a second child after the countryside launch, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000 inhabitants, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the countryside, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but below 2008.
Feng Juying, Managing Director of the Family Planning Committee in the municipality of Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want to have more children.
They want to have their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed.
But like many Chinese, they only have minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Western people mistakenly consider that single child’s policy is a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose woman is pregnant seven months of the couple’s first child.
It's true, we're stealing the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
That's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said she wanted only a single child because she was one of them herself. "We were the center of the family and had the habit that everyone takes care of us."
We don’t have the habit of taking care of someone else and we don’t really want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, says it more increasingly.
For couples working in two, middle-class, which lower the birth rate, he says, we need to be selfish to succeed.
People 20 or 30 years old grew up seeing their parents fighting in the early times of capitalist China and do not want themselves to have this lifestyle, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from his parents, he said.
A mother must give up at least two years of his social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best maternity."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher level of life, he says.
We don’t want to make too much sacrifices.
United Nations Group has draft emission reduction plans
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations -- so far characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- returned under the lights of the ramp Friday, due to the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations in most times.
The text that could provide the foundations for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gas, stressed the remaining obstacles, as much as it illuminated the path to take.
But it has been seen as an important step in the lack of time negotiations, with more than 100 world leaders arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a special UN working group, the text does not tell how rich countries would give the poor to support global, current and long-term warming.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and new emerging economies could decrease their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of global temperature rise that officials would be ready to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative at Washington at Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what UN Executive Secretary-General on Climate Change, Yvo de Boer, described as “the full image.”
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions in 2020 from 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their emissions from 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also launched the negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to support floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal disputes have occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, U.S. Representative for Climate Negotiations, rejected any discussion that requires the reduction of greenhouse gas by industrialized countries, in comparison to voluntary efforts made by major emerging economies, if they were not funded by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration has become harder to China than the Bush administration has been two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions from major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern commented an hour after Chinese Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, He Yafei said the U.S. main negotiator, either lacking "good sense" or "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not financially help China to fight global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the leading world powers at stake, defects appeared both within the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle more concerns the rescue of individual economies than the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States challenging about their respective obligations while the poorest nations insist on the fact that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that major powers fight to know who should be undergoing the costs of reducing greenhouse gas, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to pressure to obtain a legally mandatory treaty in Copenhagen, although most major participants say negotiations will lead to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which gathers 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the Climate Unit of the European Commission, said that the action of small island states has "mighty political pressure on the comprehensive political process", in part by the fact that they are now unified and that they call on emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The debates became an urgent affair, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the issues in the process before the heads of government reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as Indian Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice-Minister dropped out of their plane and rushed to the Bella Center building to attend closing door meetings and information conferences, in order to be able to make claims that will be studied over the next week.
The real picture of the gathering – in which 13,000 people enter and exit the Congress Palace every day – guitar players present night shows mocking from countries that they believe, betray themselves and proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by email – is a real challenge.
Intensity is only increasing: almost all major ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the court of the Greats, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for Global Conservation International Policy.
Heavy cars are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday’s syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. Monday morning, a sifflet shot will pierce the night to report the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed shuttle train will reach 225 km/h, while it will run from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin neighborhood train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
Small lost holes will become flourishing outskirts, business trips will be much less long and the passage of the plane and car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing road flights.
In theory, the three major political parties join this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and environmental danger fears are at risk to break British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to make a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next step planned for the high-speed network.
The new line connecting London to West Midlands will be drawn within five meters of the urban area and places where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the countryside, the plane will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 presents three options for a higher-speed network, ranging north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The privileged options are set forward in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line goes to the West Midlands.
The line will separate in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch running west of the Pennines in Manchester and Scotland and another running northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A unique line will cross Scotland.
"It seems to be the best performance option," a rail professional said.
When it is over, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a current one-hour trip.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the fastest British network in the world.
The initial track is designed to allow trains of 400m in length and can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can run on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
As space constraints are given, it is expected that an existing station will be enlarged to receive the high-speed network.
Experts in the rail industry state that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network must be built part by part.
Trains will first be forced to drive off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, maintaining travel times between London and Scotland more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure a passage from aircraft to trains, constituting a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers Refund GBP 75.000 Loan for Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, lead member of Tory Parliament, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to refund the cost of an orange house he built in his house in his district.
The party leader who was backgraded by David Cameron for complaining that members of the parliament were "enrolled," increased his borrowing by £75,000 to build an oak extension at his second home in Rutland.
He had been authorized to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not asked by Sir Thomas Legg, who controls the expenditures of members. Last night, Mr. Duncan said the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of the parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in its district of Rutland - Melton.
The surrounding houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the Emoluments office states that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange rain.
The neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to explain the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation made by the Committee on the Privileges and Standards of the Commons, concerning his provisions of prior borrowing.
The Committee innocented him last month of any charges of failure to comply with the rules, after an investigation of his expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal certainty of borrowing GBP 271,406 from his London property at the house of his district that he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of the parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed about GBP 1,400 a month of borrowing interests until March last year.
In April, his applications increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
Mr. Duncan's RBS borrowing interest rate was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the GBP 75.000 borrowing.
The variable RBS standard interest rate increased from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, without moving since.
The last publication by the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to demand GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as a Ghost Cabinet Responsible in September, after a covered journalist supposedly filmed him declaring that parliament members should survive "on budget" after the expenditure scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on budget" and you're treated as "of the m...and"
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part based on what was right.
I could have asked more, but I didn’t.”
The member of the parliament, a millionaire since his former position as a oil trader, began to explain his expenditure, in May, after it appeared that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the fees office that this "may be considered excessive."
An activist digged a £-shaped hole in M. Duncan’s grass, to protest after he was revealed he had requested £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Mr. Duncan said, "This was for major improvements, approved both by the fees office and then by Legg."
He added: "There are no problems with the robbery or the development or the use of rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn’t be cleaner or simpler.”
Loyalties, all come and see the Brighton Adventure Calendar
Brighton’s beach cabins have found a new way of promotion for the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabins for every December day, using as a theme, Christmas songs.
The event began on December 1, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 17:30 a.m. to 18:30 a.m., every day, with pastels and hot wine served free of charge.
Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a Hove TV marketing assistant, is an unpaid priest of the Chichester diocese and Director of Beyond.
He said, “We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a church, why do we expect people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the church should come closer to people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
"The idea of the Advent calendar of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with some friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is a so creative and vibrant place and we try to experiment and represent it through spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and worldwide for climate
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming worldwide and in Copenhagen, where the police carried out several hundred interpellation.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, about 100 thousands, have marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the margin of the United Nations Climate Conference, charged with an agreement that could come into force by Friday on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish Chairman of the Climate Conference, the increasing climate mobilization around the world, illustrated by these protests, contributed to making "the political award" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the cortigue, when a group of 300 demonstrators, wholly dressed in black, broke paved and hammered windows, an AFP journalist said.
Police officers were immediately intervened without planning.
In total, the police announced the interpellation of 600 to 700 people, essentially members of the Black Blocks, these ultraviolent groups that had been illustrated at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of activists were arrested “without distinction,” highlighting that one hundred of them “was always held in the street Saturday evening” “notted and kept in sitting position despite the extreme cold.”
Parliament Party, the cortege, a pretty good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, the site of negotiations.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres away from the building, without seeking to enter it.
A scene was created to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlekeeping with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cap, Desmond Tutu.
Most protesters came by and train from major cities in Europe, but many Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue sky waterproof, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who heard to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we go down to the streets to request repair of ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Philippine activist at the South Coalition Jubilee in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, estimated the Benin singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, water streams where you can walk as you have never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the Alter-Mondialism movement approached environmental organizations.
French European Deputy José Bové, a figure of alter-globalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen to “live climate justice and social justice”: “Today there is no cut between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world.”
The Asia-Pacific region, which houses many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had given the demonstrations.
About 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had gone down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, marched in red, treating bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, a few hundred demonstrators have also held a meeting to demand an energetic action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (nord), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Abkhazian separatist elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The voting offices closed at 17:00 GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closure, according to the Abkhaze Electoral Commission officials.
The first provisional results were to be announced in the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the outgoing President Sergei Bagapch, categorically rejected the idea of reunification with Georgia, who condemned the vote.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili “reclaims that Abkhazia falls under the total occupation of Russia,” his spokesman Manana Manjgaladze said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it as part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousands, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, told AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to vote for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the voting office at a school in Sookhumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidency in this region with the sumptuous landscapes, on the edge of the Black Sea.
Vast signs showing Mr. Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are installed somewhere in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In western Gali, district chief Beslan Archba reserved a warm welcome to Russian officials who came to monitor the run of the vote.
We, the Abkhazian people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, in reference to Moscow’s support, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazian independence.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexey Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, such as that which gives Russia control over the Abkhazian railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support neither the current power nor the opposition.
A 50% majority plus a vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidates reach this threshold, a second round must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: demonstrations worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people went around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the whole-living, arrested nearly 700 people on the margin of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty-thirty thousand people, according to the police, about 100 thousands, have marched in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until December 18, seeking an agreement that will have to come into force on January 1, 2013.
Parliament Party, the cortege, overall good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations are held.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the center, without seeking to penetrate it.
A scene was created to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlekeeping with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cap, Desmond Tutu.
A few minutes after the departure of the cortex, a group of a few hundred demonstrators, fully dressed in black, with bricks and hammers, broke windows, an AFP journalist noted.
Anti-movement policemen immediately surrounded them and intervened without planning, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the interpellation of 600 to 700 people, noting that they were primarily members of the Black Blocks, these ultra-violent groups that were illustrated at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat during incidents that led to the interpellation of about twenty people, police said.
We looked at the extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen had warned, while the helicopters of the order forces rotating in the sky.
The majority of protesters, who came by and by train from major cities in Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue sky waterproof, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who heard to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we go down to the streets to request repair of ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Philippine activist at the South Coalition Jubilee in Copenhagen.

French European Deputy José Bové, a figure of alter-globalism, told the AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "live climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no cut between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN Refugee Commissioner Mary Robinson, who had to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which houses many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had given the demonstrations.
About 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had gone down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and tree bandnas boasting solar energy in front of the town hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, meetings of a few hundred demonstrators have also held to demand action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (nord), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Geo-history is reinforced from the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
National Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview to be published in the JDD Sunday that history and geography were "enforced" from the general high school reform, despite the suppression of their mandatory teaching in a scientific terminal.
Now, first students will have every four hours per week and the same program for a shared culture, says Chatel.
For the minister, "we must get out of hypocrisy" because, he says, "the field S is no longer a scientific field" but "in large part, it focuses on the best students."
The ES and L lines cannot remain in the S sub-lines, he continues, emphasizing: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals indignating from the absence of terminal history geography in technological high schools."
Saturday, an Ifop survey published in Humanity revealed that nearly seven out of ten (69%) Frenchers disapproved the government’s project to remove the mandatory teaching of S-terminal history geography. Many intellectuals and teachers have also criticized this removal, as well as the left and some right-wing elected.
On the other hand, the minister added that it was "no question" of removing the philosophy of the terminal program S.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teachers’ training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a mobilization day on Tuesday to protest against the project, which says sacrifices the educational training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will spend in the beginning of the year an eligibility test that will bear on their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test that will bear on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also follow internships during the M2 year and will be a first year before students as internship teachers.
If you add all the courses proposed before the competition, you already get more presence in front of students, or more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Minister says he will propose “the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education.”
He also reaffirms the plan to remove the school card "by 2012".
At Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince on climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the issues of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge raised on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Supreme Normal School of Ulm Street.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize, opened the first of the conferences "Ernest", a day consisting of a chain of expert interventions, each of which is fifteen minutes, filmed and open to the public, AFP journalist noted.
We wanted to do something that captures people and gives them a desire to learn more, said on the margin of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo conference, one of the organizers of that day, who draws his name from that given by the students to the fish from the school basin.
About twenty stakeholders are chosen from the experts in their discipline and they are selected for their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes," told AFP Jean Jouzel, who expressed itself without notes, but using graphics, in front of about 50 people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he said, hoping that auditors will retain that “the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific issue.”
Videos from these conferences will be published on the school site as of December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled in February, followed by others at a bi-monthly pace.
Payment delays: anger of prison supervisors, planned actions
Prison supervisors unions called on Friday for "general mobilization" to demand payment by the end of the year's feasts of premiums and extra hours whose payment was dismissed to January for budget reasons.
FO-Pensionary (2nd union of supervisors) asked staff who will not be in service to demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of prison facilities and "block them" to "denounce the theft of their dues".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "gather in general assemblies in the various prisons for strong mobilization," judging "honest and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "extra hours, night prizes, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to bring up dissatisfaction and anger."
The Department of Penitentiary Administration and the Department of Justice explain that overhours have increased significantly in 2009 and not all have been budgeted, but ensure that relics will be paid in January.
The Chancellor said in the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to supervisory unions to guarantee that this payment would be made next month.
I do not know the efforts made by staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, the Minister of Justice wrote in this letter.
I asked the executive of the prison administration to immediately implement a set of measures to ensure that this situation is due to a poor assessment of the number of additional hours does not occur in the future, Ms. Alliot-Marie added.
The December pay will therefore be lean, except for managing personnel benefiting from well-known duties and target premiums, Ufap/Unsa regretted, for which “budgetary constraints have good backs.”
It is a pure scandal, the FO interregional union of Marseille announced its decision to boycott up to a new order "all meetings and conferences".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regulated in December, i.e. for overtime, also threaten FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the time we increase our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to take care of staff money, Bordeaux's CGT-penitentiary estimates.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are less poor than others.
But nonetheless the account is there, Ufap Secretary-General Jean-François Forget said.
For Christmas, Obama says he offers "couter trees" than those he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is preparing to spend his first family Christmas at the White House, entrusted to the paperback of the small screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple gift rule: "I give things more nice than those I get."
As part of a special show that will be broadcast on the ABC channel Sunday night, President and his wife Michelle offer an insight into how they want to celebrate the end of the year in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion will be the game.
Christmas Father also loves Bo, thus said Michelle Obama, noting that the dog would have "surely" a gift, according to extracts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama falsified against her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: "Not sure, I gave you nice gifts last year," she said.
Absolutely, did he have been forced to grant before replicating with humour by showing the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you this?"
During this one-hour show, in the relaxed atmosphere, with the famous animator who was a fervent support by Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father rarely saw offered him at Christmas.
I remember this time I met my father came to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a basketball, the president said.
It was only long later in my life that I realized that it was him who gave me that ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I really didn’t know how to organize a house so I had aligned all the furniture to the wall, rather than arranging them around the fireplace, but I loved this small dolls house, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday reopened, RTL says he is in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was reopened in Los Angeles due to significant "lesions" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was reopened on Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors saw "lesions resulting from the operation" of the hernia distacle suffered in Paris on November 26, his press office told Paris that these lesions had "became a repair operation".
The singer's press service however wanted to reassure the situation was "under control", while announced that a new medical newsletter would be communicated no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, Johnny Hallyday’s partner in the last singer’s tour, however, had been immersed in an artificial coma to avoid “pains and complications.”
It is only within 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient’s state when he’s opened an eye, RTL adds.
Asked by the AFP, the press department did not confirm or comment the information.
RTL also states that "according to some sources" no drain would have been laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of the Monceau Park for this hernia scale.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, had been practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
This was not available Thursday evening to comment on RTL information.
Following his operation on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection following the intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close to Johnny Hallyday, said on RTL on Thursday that his friend was passing through “a bad pass,” but assured that he “no worry” about the rocker, which is “a beater.”
He had called me right before leaving to Los Angeles, and I told him that it was a fool because doing twelve hours of plane after such a operation, it's not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer’s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to reassure himself, saying Johnny Hallyday “worked satisfactoryly to antibiotics” and that the infection was “endly.”
Mr. Camus also said he had talked to Laetitia, the wife of the singer, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer’s health issues have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed to have been operated with "small colon cancer", then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as expected his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been abundantly commented. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the singer moving on stage.
In mid-November, his surrounding person even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: the first of Bousquet on its fetish distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, triple medailled at the Worlds 2009 in large basin, won an international title on a distance that he particularly loves, the 50 m free swimming, during the Euro 2009 in small basin in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where the combinations are allowed for the last time only saw three world records beaten while we were waiting for a discharge.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swimming and the other two by Russia in 4x50 m 4 swimming relays.
A regret for Bousquet, who bothered on the 50m free world record, of which he holds the brand in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the 50m free, it is the 28-year-old Frenchman who imposed himself in 20 sec. 53 in a final where ten swimmers usually started against eight, a first at international level.
Bousquet advanced Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world brand (20.30) as he had envisaged.
We can always dream better and in the event, I had said that if the world record was at my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane combinations, which will be prohibited from January 1st.
Originally 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finished their epope in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of the combinations didn’t serve this time the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in large pool this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower the brand he holds on 400 m free swim (3:32.77) but nevertheless imposed himself by signing the second best time in his career (3:34.55), in front of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't get into this race.
I knew I couldn’t beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and completed my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: A Sarcophage Panel Belonging to Zola Awarded 1.5 Million USD
A panel of Roman sarcophagus belonging to French writer Emile Zola was awarded $1.5 million on Thursday, clearly above his estimate, art merchant Sotheby's announced.
This front panel of two meters long on 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decoration, surrounded by satyrs and bacants, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of the Roman and Egyptian art auction at Sothebys on Tuesday.
It was sold from about a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have the most purchased so far, AFP told a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of Emile Zola’s acquisition of this marble dates back to a few days.
The panel remained nearly 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively with French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of his bath in his particular Parisian hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister under the Third Republic of France and briefly President of the Council before the accession to the power of Marechalta.
There was a shadow area of about fifty years.
Browsing the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "succession Emile Zola" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Therese Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Aborted departure attempt from Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico considered Thursday that the conditions were no longer fulfilled for the transfer to its territory of the fallen President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was refused by the Putchist government.
At the moment, after a phone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not gathered, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
Arriving in Salvador on Wednesday to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government's plane returned to its place of origin, according to a source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The Putchist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "resign" and request political asylum abroad to grant him a safe conduct.
But the declined president refused because he wanted to visit Mexico as an invited head of state.
The putschist government "has experienced a new failure in wanting I to give up my burden (...) they wanted me to resign," said Zelaya to the radio Globo, on which he often speaks since the beginning of the political crisis that has last for five months in Central America.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing a few agreements the dropped president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico submitted a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it contains no asylum request, Putchist Government Interior Minister Oscar Raul Matute said Wednesday at the Honduran radio HRN.
I do not ask for asylum from any countries, answered Manuel Zelaya in an interview with Telesur, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to be done as President of the Honduran people, he said.
The departure rumors of Mr. Zelaya had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the dropped president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military reinforced their seat.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has criticized the position of the Putchist government.
This demonstrates the marginality of this government towards international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on 28 June, on the day he had organized a popular consultation to prepare his reelection, against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
He was exiled in Costa Rica and returned surprisingly on September 21 and refuged to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested to respond to the crime of “high betrayal” whose justice is accused of, according to the Putchist government.
Putchist President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but disputed by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on 27 January.
Wall Street rises, U.S. Trade Balance Feeds Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, U.S. trade balance figures showing the recovery of both the US and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67 percent and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closure figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, and the technologically dominant Nasdaq from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The expanded index Standard & Poor's 500 awarded it 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We have good news from different parts of the economy, Lindsey Piegza, from FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotic, she tempered, estimating that the market focused on "the half-full glass".
For Peter Cardillo, from Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the U.S. trade balance figures, "which shows that the activity is improving in the fourth quarter."
The US trade deficit dropped by 7.6% in October compared to September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected, in contrast, a deficit growth.
Imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth of trade volumes, especially for goods exports, which reflects the growth of the economies of the main trade partners in the United States, said Christopher Cornell, research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the U.S. increased against expectations last week, to reach 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has "fallen to the lowest for a year," said Scott Marcoiller, Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
Treasury's 10-year-old good yield increased to 3.482% compared to 3.423% Tuesday night and that of the 30-year-old good to 4.492% compared to 4.408% on the previous day.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of power conspired "Ladies in white"
A few hundred supporters of Cuban power conspired wives of political detainees gathered in Havana on Thursday for the World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
About 40 "Ladies in white", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were conspired on the street by supporters of the government of Raul Castro as they walked towards the center of the capital to claim the release of political prisoners, an AFP journalist said.
At the bottom the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!" screamed, the handle lifted, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
These were escorted by civilian agents who came to "secure their protection."
On the previous day, a similar demonstration took place against the "Ladies in white" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate Thursday for the International Human Rights Day were arrested by civilian police officers, an AFP journalist said.
Police have forced the dissidents in civilian vehicles who were conspired by government supporters, according to the journalist.
Dissident interpellation in similar circumstances generally lasts only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 European Parliament Sakharov Prize, "Ladies in white" had organized an unauthorized march to "ask for the liberation of all political prisoners", 200 according to the dissident, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda purged a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is part of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of which remain under the lock.
The Cuban authorities consider opponents as “mercenaries” or “agents” at the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rare, Cuban television reported the Thursday demonstration of pro-governmental activists against “counter-revolutionaries.”
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of defeating rights and freedoms, including expression.
Forced kills an 8-year-old knife and wounded five in Clichy-la-Garenne
An armed with two knives killed an eighteen-year-old and wounded five other people in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne, at one hour of flow, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker would have hit with two knives and for undetermined reasons, an eighth-year-old, in or in front of a pharmacy of the 85th Jean-Jaurès boulevard, was learned from police sources and witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929 according to a police union official Alliance, died at the hospital because of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he was then taken to a couple whose woman was pregnant.
The husband, 30 years old, interposed and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenary killed.
The other wounded's days are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then did a discomfort and would have been hospitalized "in a shock state," according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then flee to the street, always boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have injured two passengers, apparently randomly: a thirty-year-old and a square-year-old, the latter severely.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two buckle knives that he was wearing on the cross behind the back, Arnaud Pressé, an Alliance union official in the Hauts-de-Seine, said on site.
Several passengers, including young people, according to testimonies gathered by the AFP, tried to control the forced.
I saw a thirty-year-old guy with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept it.
They didn’t get there because the guy was hard, Alberto, a nearby bar server, said.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke the wrist, he added.
Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No.61, two municipal police officers, including their officials, attempted to interpel the armed man and were injured by handle hits, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Some passengers came to tell me that there was a person injured outside.
I came out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put him in safety position, and I saw a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person aged thirty years old arrived, wounded with knife shots.
These are national police officials who arrested the man without identity papers.
The prosecution of Nanterre has seized the investigation of the Hauts-de-Seine Justice Department (SDPJ 92).
The forced person was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard as part of his guard.
A police source did not exclude him being internized in psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to master him at the Clichy police office where he was taken.
It was "in a state of overexcitation" as "all the forced of this species whose forces decupe under the effect of action."
U.S.: Polanski’s lawyer once again calls for abandonment of prosecution
Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again claimed the abandonment of prosecutions against his customer, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a case of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the director’s lawyer of the “Pianist,” denounced before three judges of the appeal court of the second district of California of serious procedural mistakes at the time of the facts, in 1977.
I call for the abandonment of the charges here and now, Mr. Hummel said, before adding that the behaviour of the judge responsible for the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back."
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has died since -- would have discussed, before sentencing his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which constitutes a serious fault of proceedings.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: desired and desired" (Roman Polanski, searched and desired), from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally said at the end of September he had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In case the court refused to abandon the prosecution, Mr. Hummel called for a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The accusation repeated the argument already developed in first instance, namely that no abandonment of the charges could be seriously studied until Roman Polanski was present in court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, prior to his sentence, for "illegal sexual relationships" with a 13-year-old minor.
He has never given his feet to the United States since.
Deputy Attorney of Los Angeles County Phyllis Asayama said that Roman Polanski “must be there to present himself in the hearing.”
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to escape? asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "appeals for a favour to the court, while despising her authority."
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decisions -- also stressed that "there are other alternatives to the flight."
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to ask for the abandonment of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
Attorney Samantha Geimer, the victim, also called for the end of the prosecution once again.
Recalling that her client no longer supports being harassed with every rebound of the Polanski case, she added: “No one in this room can say that the procedure has been fair.
Thirty-two years, it's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on U.S. arrest order.
After more than two months behind the bars, he was assigned to residence in his chalet in Gstaad, waiting for a possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, braked by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction Friday, in a market between better indicators than expected in the United States and the dollar rise: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closure figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominant Nasdaq has abandoned 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded index Standard & Poor's 500 increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of exchanges has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which “have contributed to improving the market’s opinion on the strength of economic recovery,” analytics of Charles Schwab summarised.
In the United States, retail sales increased 1.3% in November for the second follow-up month and much more than expected.
U.S. consumer confidence also sharply recovered in December at 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan Index.
The indexes have, however, been blocked by a new growth in the dollar, at the highest for two months in the face of the euro, which "downs down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, the Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have lost the ground.
The bond market has fallen.
Treasury good yield at 10 years increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday night and good at 30 years to 4.497% compared to 4.492% on the previous day.
Miss World's Election Again in South Africa
After a month’s trip across South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are preparing to cross the last right line on Saturday to realize their dream: being elected the world’s most beautiful woman in front of a billion viewers.
During this great beauty mass organized for the second year in a row in the surrounding of Johannesburg, five of them already recruited their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were elected Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a true turbillon.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I have seen a lot of things and experienced so many experiences!, exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to bring back my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have experienced it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa has been marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery "of breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, repetitions, encounters with the press and safari, the Miss now focus on competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and presented at this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both became the stars of Bollywood.
It's the dream of every woman to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, launch Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will score this 59th edition.
The candidates will walk in traditional suit and of course in bath suit.
The show will be driven by a television presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a head of the Miss World committee Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that she could welcome the world with heat and pride that it is difficult to equal, says Julia Morley, President of Miss World.
The candidates did a safari like last year, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bicycle, and tasted local cuisine.
Exceptionally done, they also met with South African President Jacob Zuma who tightened their hands.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will probably remain the fate drawing in Cape Town (South-West) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I got people I never thought I could get closer.
I’m definitely going to come back to the 2010 World Cup, excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday’s news is “very positive,” according to his son David.
Johnny Hallyday’s news “are very positive,” said his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport where he had to go to his hospitalized father’s headset for several days.
The news is very positive.
He’s very strong, it’s going very well, David Hallyday told the press on his exit from the aircraft that brought him from Paris shortly after 13:00 local (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, assured he was going to "very quickly" to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection consecutive to the operation of a hernia scale on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and be able to administer his treatment," the press department said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in artificial coma by physicians at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a hernia scale on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be reopened on Wednesday night on Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laetitia went Friday morning to French high school in Los Angeles, where their daughter Jade was schooling, to attend a school show, a photographer from the AFP noted.
The chief of orthopedic and trauma surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would go to Los Angeles with the singer on Monday.
The producer violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on November 26 at the Monceau Park International Clinic in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
I have heard of a possible coming judicial proceedings, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believed that Johnny Hallyday was “parting too fast for Los Angeles, with the Paris surgeon’s authorization.”
I had this online doctor in person who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it was amazed, since I had myself two disc hernies, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "party without drain, without anything," after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well-known in the artistic environment.
He had operated actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was exercising at the time.
In 2007, he also operated actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resort a hematoma as a result of brain bleeding.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphur reputation, several times convicted by justice, in medical responsibility records, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of the Doctors, accused him of being “a man without scrupulous” prosecuted “regularly” before the Council of Order, and who is “lawful to be recommendable.”
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself on Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention was "completely well carried out" and that post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not bleeding and therefore did not require the laying of a drain," he added.
In any case, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems to be among parenthesis.
Obviously, a recovery of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, Camus said.
The UDF Association raises the tone and sums the New Centre to no longer use its sigle
The UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou’s MoDem, reacted Friday to the attempt of the OPA of the New Centre President Hervé Morin on the sigle of the former Giscardian party, prompting him to no longer use it on any support, under penalty of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF silk, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after stretching his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is partner to the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received support from the MP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP to NC) who claims the property of the UDF brand for being the first to deposit it in 2004 to the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday night, the UDF association’s office, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to let themselves be dismissed, left his silence to launch a statement to the Minister and Member, summing them not to use the trademark and transmit the property of the brand to them, under penalty of prosecution.
In the last few days, you have multiplied the statements indicating that you are going to propose to your political movement to +reprehend+ the UDF sigle, writes the association in a mail signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Central Alliance.
You also thought it is good to follow on your activist material and on your site’s guard page, the name of this movement, the +New center+, the today’s UDF slogan, the mail signatories also observe.
As you do not know, you have no right to use this segle, explains the UDF office that points out the NC to immediately remove the mention of the UDF name from any support as well as from (his) website.
He also asks Hervé de Charette to "transmit the property of (the) mark to its legitimate rights owners".
If you did not, the courts would be arrested to enforce the law and legitimate rights of the UDF members, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they state that the UDF is "a full political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "making the choice" to leave him in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP."
The New Centre therefore, they believe, has no right to use the UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the UDF’s last congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the establishment of an office responsible for defending “the material and moral interests” of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d’Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the brand," he was "no longer member of the UDF for three years," but the UMP.
It scandally and fraudulently benefits from the deposit abscence of the UDF acronym to perform it on his behalf.
“It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthwhile to make a name by itself than to try out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one has no right.”
Affair Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court in Nanterre decided on Friday to judge artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as accused of the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he has benefited from a state of weakness of the octogenary to pull out a portion of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will be judged on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a maximum three-year imprisonment penalty and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the wealthiest families in France, in which mother and daughter break up while holding the threads of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
But the 15th correctional chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt should be conducted by three doctors.
L'Oréal's leading heirs and shareholder has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the prosecutor of Nanterre in the investigation.
Doctors appointed Friday will have to submit a report before March 10, 2010, saying in particular whether Liliane Bettencourt has been in weakness and at what periods.
I think she'll submit to it.
I'm going to talk to him about it, Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, said at the exit of the hearing.
For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...) The expertise will demonstrate that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady that must be protected, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s unique daughter has committed criminal prosecutions against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist touch-à-tout, who she accuses of taking advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to obtain a billion euros of donations, in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or master tables.
Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, which she considers as a long-standing friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of the action undertaken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyer's complaints sometimes turned to the great family dispacking Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said to be disappointed with the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer, “Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years?
Françoise, I have never been able to talk to her since her marriage.”
On the other hand, the prosecutor of Nanterre once again considered that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially as a tutel judge has refused in recent days to make the right to her request to open a judicial protection proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full ability to act in court, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place,” said the public prosecutor, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would be ruled once the trial took place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Managerial revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of major French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards its employees recalls the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about making employees join determined “values” from above as it was once, to impose on consumers products thought by the factory’s technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has brought market conquest strategies to the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products offline from customer preference factors returns regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to mortal demobilization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the part of a much more general phenomenon that affects the frames.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, moreover, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE "requires from all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a prospective vision"; it requires from employees a commitment that authoritarian management revenues are totally contrary.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would consist of putting employees at the centre of the company's concerns as well as the customer.
Relative use of internal opinion surveys
Internal opinion surveys – like Orange’s employees’ questionnaire – will encourage this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First because I could see that, in the face of a new situation, any structure ultimately comes, after a lot of turns, to do primarily... what it has always done.
Then, because authoritarism – one of the pathologies of power – grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simple vision of human behavior.
From the large schools of engineers, they have a mechanist interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the US "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, unknownly, by the institutes of study and the media.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to manage the "rivers" (sic) of the commitment of the executives, a recent investigation of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr, it encourages the leaders in a position of mechanist governance, inadequate to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses supposes to adopt a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental conclusion: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means of achieving a portion of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from the functional analysis adopt this concept of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their business based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to assess what it offers them to realize their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, corporate leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and return their management of human resources "to the place".
They thus create a ground favorable to the concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo’s Speech: “Fair War” is worth praise on the right to Obama
The U.S. Right greeted on Friday the speech by Barack Obama in Oslo, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 defended the concept of “fair war” against US enemies.
The Conservatives, who brocarded the award for Mr. Obama on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former Vice-President candidate in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, an agency of the Right-wing of the Republican Party, to the USA Today newspaper, adding to have taken on herself the theme of the war "sometimes necessary" in her memories that have just been published.
War is of course the last thing that Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
These terrorists must be stopped all over there, she said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send additional 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, said that the president had done Oslo "the very good job."
I found that the speech was really very good, congratulated the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
On some sides, I found this all-in-fact historical speech, Mr. Gingrich, asked during the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elect, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican investment for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to have seen "a left president" remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not give a peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, George W. Bush’s former columnist, Obama spoke “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does it," he spoke as an American president, reminding Europeans "that they live in a safety bubble that they have not created and do not do much to preserve it," said Gerson.
Among the few on the right to not be convinced, a fake of the Bush era, the former UN ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as "tern, bulb and uninspired" on the National Review Online site.
On the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When the war is enveloped in the notion of justice, the massacre of innocents can be easily justified, he warned.
However, the center-left press remained elogious to the president's place.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel Award was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, described his speech as “superproduction” even for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo’s speech “should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression,” California’s newspaper inflamed.
Obama "has spoken the speech needed," the New York Times said, judging him "simultaneously dark and building."
Routers: Three Marathons for Agreement That Saves Christmas Supplies
After three marathon negotiations, the trade unions in the road sector and TLF, the only employer organization to remain until the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that ends the strike word and the threat to Christmas supplies.
At the signature session on Friday night, Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiled" this agreement, after several negotiations, started on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators left early Friday morning, hoping to quickly sign the text of agreement in the late morning.
And even though three employer organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had clogged the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting started at 11:00 to make everyone agree and to sign the text at 18:00.
“The conflict would have been very harmful to businesses” and “it was to be afraid that it would be coming to disrupt the end-year holidays,” Bussereau said.
The text provides an increase in salaries by 4% for the lowest salaries (in local and regional road transportation), and by 2.9% for the highest (international transportation).
In hourly rate, for low wages, "we go from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
It’s not much, but we’re going from far away, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
We will either order our activists that there are no blockades, no blockades of supply centers.
But you can still have some recalcitrants that are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed “a good deal”, even though it was “difficult to grant increases in high wages given international competition.”
According to him, the increases will be from 170 euros monthly for low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of good sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) saluted “a historical agreement.”
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to “an acceptable compromise.”
The agreement also provides for the revaluation of travel costs of 3%, and the maintaining of the general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will include addressing the issue of a 13th month and modernizing the collective agreement.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a decrease of €100 million in employer charges" was subject to a governmental amendment to the 2009 draft amendment financial law, voted on Thursday night by the National Assembly Friday.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in the same term."
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply first to companies members of this organization, and second, to the whole profession, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be “as soon as possible,” said Bussereau.
The opposition of employer organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "dupes market", as the 100 million euros had already been promised to the sector to compensate for some of the carbon tax.
The Secretary of State of Transport forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but not to contradict the eater of the next wake-up day, UNOSTRA lamented.
For the Other, the agreement risks "to dig the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months."
RER A: disturbances this weekend, unions mistaken with RATP proposals
The disturbances on RER A, France’s largest urban public transport line, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday on the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and RATP’s direction left them on their hunger as to their prize request.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of purchases before Christmas, there will only be trains between 10:00 and 20:00, due to one train in two on the central section (between La Defense and Nation) and one train in four outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force travellers to change train.
The Lafayette Galleries, which awaits 200,000 customers every day, are delighted that “RATP makes efforts to serve big stores.”
The RER crosses from west to west is the Parisian agglomeration.
The short RATP section from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains circulated at the peak hours, and almost no branches in hours, as expected.
As Thursday, there was no cough on the whales, the Francis were organized.
Thus in the morning, the resort of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequent than usual, especially due to the lack of college students and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he stood up “an hour thirty earlier, to be sure to arrive at the time.”
St. Lazare's railway station has not experienced saturation, the SNCF said, which had planned a management of officers and officers.
The RERs A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare Station to get to the subways.
New general assemblies of Grevites will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, judged “magic” by the trade unions, from a meeting with the management Friday afternoon.
The RER Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career running, etc.
This is not what drivers want, who claim a debt premium, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals between parentheses, the CGT was indignated, highlighting that the direction "was not a problem to solve while in road traders and the SNCF it is done."
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for “a broader review of the terms of exercise of the profession,” RATP said.
This also told trade unions that the company “fought the users of the weekend.”
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the management, which until then refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested the meeting "in anxiety of relaxation".
The conflict threatens to expand to the RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and Independents filed a notice.
The trade unions demand a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, including 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line to the daily million travellers.
RER drivers, all in the second part of the career, range from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros premiums, for timetables, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurds party, heavy decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court pronounced Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurds party, a decision immediately followed by protests of anger in the Kurdish community, southeast of the country and Istanbul.
This decision is likely to greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just stretched the Kurdish community to attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) has been dissolved because it had become a "fourth of activities that have prejudice to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," the president of the Court Hasim Kiliç told the press, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was unanimously taken by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, said Kiliç, adding that 37 of the party’s executives, including President Ahmet Türk and MEP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity of Mr. Türk and Mrs. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the Party's property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
His leaders had warned before the verdict that members would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without label.
The decision follows a proceedings launched in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Cassation Court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, which accuses the DTP of obeying the “directives” of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, assures that it has “no organic ties” with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court’s verdict comes while the government has just stepped hands on the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to attempt to overthrow the Kurdish support to the PKK and to end the conflict.
DTP leaders had claimed that dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in southeastern Anatolian, where numerous protests against the conditions of detention of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated with police in recent weeks.
As of the announcement of justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP’s premises in Diyarbakir, the majority of Kurds in the southeast.
Order forces fired tear granates and used water canons, while protesters launched molotov cocktails or stones, with fronds.
About 100 people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk claimed that the decision of Justice would "depthrough despair."
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish, ndlr) by prohibiting a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
We are by principle opposed to the closing of the parties.
This resolves nothing, energy minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a total torpedo of the government’s democratic openness, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
It can be expected, of course, to a PKK reaction, he added.
Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
First snow can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very rigorous winter.
But the Road Saving and Deblayage Service (FES) manager states that it is not to disturb citizens.
It is simply so that agents can test the vehicle technique and learn how to master them well.
And according to the meteorologists, this might well be for the end of this week.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to tackle snow and glass.
The FES follows a very developed plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explains that as soon as he begins to snow over the city of Frankfurt and the temperatures drop below zero, large soaking vehicles run 20 main routes (so-called routes A).
This includes large circulation streets, main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloped streets such as the Atzelbergstraße are also included.
FES officers start their service at 3 p.m.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometers of the road must be salted with a road founder that adheres well, within 3 hours of maximum time.
This is why the FES service begins at 3:00 in the morning "in order that the roads are free when the traffic of daily migration begins."
There or it gets harder, it's when the snow begins to fall at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, the road deflection and sanding officer tells us "because no driver is willing to let the sanding vehicles pass."
Then, if snow is no longer, we take care of access roads and services - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger knows that this always causes some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the EFS pedestrian team starts to prioritize areas considered dangerous and passages.
As for cycling paths, the FES services usually cannot take care of it.
Mr. Brauburger states that there is a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the state of the bridges between 22 hours and 4:30 hours.
As the glass forms very quickly on these surfaces, the sanding vehicles occur as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
It also happens that the police appeal to this special service in need.
The dinosaur cradle
The Tawa hallae resembled other carnivoral dinosaurs: this bipede measured about 2 meters long for 1.50 meters high, its behind limbs were powerful, his sleeping skull was equipped with sharp and turned teeth, his short arms ended with sickle claws, and he had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as reported by Sertling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues in the Science magazine on Thursday, the Tawa Hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time was part of the land emerged from the supercontinent, the Pangee and was towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says the discovery of the Tawa lights on a new day the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, it informs us about the links of relatives, the distribution and characteristics of these.
In 2006 Sertling Nesbitt started excavations with other paleontologists, at Gohst Ranch's site in the north of New Mexico.
Randall Irmis from the Utah Natural History Museum and a member of the excavation team tells them that sometimes they were able to find a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating back to the Trias.
Scientists quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the beginning of the evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers named Tawa according to the word Hopi Indians for the god of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: the fossils of dinosaurs from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few fragments of incomplete bones.
Not all experts in paleontology share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander from the University of Bonn does not find that this discovery is particularly spectacular, but he says that it confirms certain theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, which makes the classification of all early dinosaurs very difficult.
Experts wonder, among others, when the Saurians were divided into three major evolution groups: the theropodes (carnivores) which include the tyrannosaure and the velociraptor later appeared and which descend the birds, the sauropodes, the long-neck quadrupedes, and those who are their relatives and the ornithic herbivorures.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first theropodes.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found indications that lead to think that the Tawa hallae had small air bags in its bones at the skull level, just like birds that are descendants of the theropodes.
These small air pockets facilitate the breathing of birds compared to mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa hallae, vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, Tawa is one of the oldest theropodes with small air bags in its bones.
As the related line of immense sauropods also possessed air bags and a light bone, it may be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive known dinosaurs lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the Saurians had appeared there.
Therefore, the three major lines of evolution divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, that is, all of the lands emerged that formed the Pangee Supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropodes that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot come from a common ancestor who had migrated, the researchers advance.
Alan Turner from the New York Natural History Museum and co-author of Science Studies magazine says there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says there is an even older species, the silhouette, which lived in current Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a wrong vision because in South America there are a large number of fossils of dinosaurs that have been preserved while there are virtually none on other continents.
On the other hand, how dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tetrapodes of the secondary era as they proved a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, still remains a mystery.
At the time of the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as with the ancestors of current crocodiles and with many other Saurians.
Towards the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread across the planet, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassic.
Such a success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There could be a massive extinction that dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or then, the dinosaurs were better suited, so they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favourite meteorite growing of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and that since then had been in the shadow: they were mammals.
The Solidarity of Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are those of professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those of courses at the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation by the police from the J.W. Goethe University of Frankfurt casino makes waves all over the planet.
278 professors and teachers at J.W. Goethe University and also other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protest students at Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English they condemn the police intervention claimed by the university's steering committee.
Last week, President of Werner Müller-Estler University had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers in strike after walls and artworks were beaten with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories believe that the degradations did not justify such a violent intervention from the police commando against students and teachers who had organized their own courses.
Evacuation represents an "inacceptable reach" to freedom of research and teaching.
Focusing exclusively on the acts of vandalism uses only to "delegitimate and criminalize the protest" and attempts to forget the reasons for mobilization.
The University Directorate has thus removed the debates that would still be essential.
Course officers require that the criminal proceedings undertaken be immediately suspended.
The majority of occupants did not take part in the degradations.
Legitimation of protests
The young people of the Verdi union of the Services Sector and the German union confederation (DGB) are solidarised with students.
The protests are only the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional youth secretary of the Verdi union.
As for the Minister of Science of Hesse Land Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she has taken and caused the action undertaken by the President of the University and the Police.
Thank you to the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the place is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday at the TV show Actual Hour.
We understand the meaning of protests but do not accept vandalism, CDU Member of the Regional Parliament, Peter Beuth, said.
The SPD opposition parliamentary groups, the Greens and the Left (the Left) did not share this opinion.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few painting walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Left)
Instead of thinking about students' arguments and claims, they are evacuated.
The Left Party has filed a motion that summed up the Minister of Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The New Silicon Valley
For a long time she had the reputation of a secret city, prohibited to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of search for secret weapons, under strict surveillance.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the town has the reputation of being the Soviet “Silicon Valley”.
Important production and research places in micro- and nanoelectronics are placed there.
As of September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd created links with Riedberg, a Francfort Science Place – with the academic institutes and societies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday the representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Narrow Collaboration Protocol".
The signatories were Moscow Vice Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz, project section head for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the fast-expanding Russian market.
In contrast, Russian scientific companies wish to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of famous Soviet research institutes and companies.
There is the Institute of Electrotechnics in Moscow, the major Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika firms.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literal "Green City" translation) draws its name from the wooded hills in the heart of which research centers are deployed.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The magnitude of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be placed high enough.
For his supporters, it is nothing less than “new heart of Europe”.
S21 is much more than the enclosure of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will dive the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a desperate chaos of construction for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
The line-head stations, with paths that ended in the full town, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of the 19th century transportation technique that made effect of modern rail traffic brake sabots because it used a lot of time to pass the locomotives from the back to the front.
Arrival, short arrest, departure – that’s what you need to do.
That is why the headline stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train passage station, which is about halfway on the Trans-European Magistral of the Rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava from which the slogan "Heart of Europe".
The realization of the S21 project will really begin, although visions of the 1980s have long no longer been compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost, to enclose the railway station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
In fact, line-head stations no longer pose genuine input and output problems since there are modern, reversible trains with motorways and car-pilot at both ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 is now launched next to the new trace of the inter-city line towards Ulm.
Regional and communal policies have overcome it.
The railway company is the party because it is the taxpayer who makes the risk costs of the largest infrastructure project in the federal republic and not the public enterprise.
From the urban perspective, this project is left relatively well justified.
An urban space is obtained that – if you believe the graphs of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The passage station and enlargement of the section are designed for a traffic of people to which it was attributed - and it is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the time there was no competition for cheap flights yet.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening goods traffic because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new draft, with its inclinations, is not suitable for goods trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly concerns many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed in the Suabe project.
This is the official figure.
Experts believe 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is sure, in the next decade, this money will be missing for other points of junction and growth in the network.
The Department of Transport list refers to sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the expansion of the section through the Rhine Valley of 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been built slowly.
It would be really urgent to support the mushroom here.
But the S21 project is the effect of a braking sabot.
The route of the Rhine Valley is on the road to become the crackdown of international merchandise trafficking, in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment concerning the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Government of the country has mentioned the possibility of appealing to the judgment of the Administrative Court of Hesse concerning the ban on night air flights.
The Minister of Economics Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to examine from a legal point of view the judgment made by the Administrative Court and which is a document comprising more than 400 pages.
The Court of Kassel had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation on the ban on night flights in the case or the project of construction of the northwestern landing track of Frankfurt Airport would be achieved.
The authorization for 17 aircraft between 23h and 5h in the morning, as considered by the Government of the Land, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air impairments.
The coalition must have decided for January 4 if it wishes to make a case in cassation against the judgment.
The opposition criticizes this deadline and attempts to pressure the representative of the Government to resume the appeal to the Federal Administrative Court of Leipzig.
The head of the SPD Parliamentary Group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made prior to the elections, which consisted of prohibiting night flights.
It is quite difficult to be allowed to keep his speech, Tarek Al-Wazir, head of the Greens, said, referring to the FDP’s electoral slogan “We hold our promises.”
Minister Dieter Posch rejects Schäfer-Gümbel's accusations that the country's government is trying to allow night flights by using "lawyers and rubles".
It takes time to conduct a specific legal examination.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a “fast first impression.”
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the statements of its fraction on the ban on night flights is completely wrong.
U.S. Banks Refund Aid Awarded
The large U.S. banks, who are very affected by the crisis, are out of their ties towards the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully refunded the Treasury $45 billion (more than 30 billion euros), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
The U.S. television channel CNBC reported that Citigroup was also planning to refund the aid received.
The banking institutions thus seek to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of the sums, such as the limitation of the bonuses awarded to the executives and the settlement of higher costs.
The Bank of America launched an increase in capital by selling securities to investors that brought it $19 billion in fresh money.
The rest of the sum comes from the bank’s cash that are well filled thanks to the sale of several branches from other sectors.
On Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, Director-General of Bank of America, expressly obliged to thank U.S. taxpayers: capital injection has helped significantly overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capabilities by buying Merrill Lynch’s investment bank to the strongest of the financial torment.
The Citigroup also plans to purchase money on financial markets to free itself from the state’s guardianship.
The U.S. bank could thus launch a capital increase of $20 billion earlier Thursday, the CNBC channel citing banks reported.
Citigroup spokesman did not want to comment on this information.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had refunded the public funds they had benefited.
Accelerated election
Eventually everything went faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the removal of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German ZDF Chain, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who led the Berlin writing of ZDF, was the great favorite.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there was also the willingness not to further harm the manager of the ZDF Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal was not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of nine out of 14 members of the Commission.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender’s contract by five years, but it was rejected.
Only seven members of the Council declared themselves in favour of Brender's reconduction and seven others voted against. Brender's destitution by vote represented a failure, although predictable for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority in the Board of Directors, had already left hearing several weeks before the vote, not wanting to return Brender to his position.
It is Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the country of Hesse who organized a league against the editor.
He had refused the contract of the highly appreciated chief editor to be extended by invoking the fact that the listening rate of the ZDF information emissions had dropped under Brender.
That's why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, striving the increasing political influence on the ZDF.
At the end there were even 35 public law experts who had entered into the debate and believed that Koch's action was anti-constitutional.
But that wouldn't help anything.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (Rhine-Palatinate radio organ) and at the Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily nationally reached).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first of all at the newspaper "today" (today's newspaper).
Then his course continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy of the editor-in-chief of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazines" (two-monthly reporting show presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the ZDF foreign policy service and head of the reaction.
After Brender's disgrace, while he was just elected journalist of the year by Medium Magazin's specialized journal, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch’s opponent in the Board of Directors, Minister-President of Rhine-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that Länder should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the staff proposals of the manager cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to ask for the withdrawal of political personalities members of the ZDF Supervisory Commissions.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor had skilfully manoeuvred with the Board of Directors by criticizing the committee with confidence in his decision to remove Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the post of chief writer without losing his face, as well as the Board of Directors could elect it without being supposed to place a political supporter in the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as liberal left.
Great cleaning in academic studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliative: at a meeting between Ministers and delegates of the Rectors Conference, an agreement was developed stipulating that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to finish their studies.
In particular, they agreed to lighten the weight of the examinations: a single examination must enable the selected study module to be closed.
In addition, the workload will need to be reconciled to guarantee "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder also committed themselves to arranging more flexible common structural prescriptions for Bachelor and Master fields.
At the regional level, there should be no different regulations from country to country.
Less examinations
Since the beginning of the student protests in June last, the Minister of Education of the Länder and university rectores have constantly moved on the mouth the expression of fashion: "studiability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board decided to significantly reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module must normally be able to be concluded by a single examination," it can be read in a document of about thirty pages on future entry conditions to academic cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, stated that by dramatically reducing the burden of the examinations, we should be able to stop the decays, which significantly harmed the studyability.
The "studiability" should also be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies in the future.
Modules as well as the background must be carefully examined to see if you cannot avoid this feeling of suffocation that you sometimes feel in choosing the courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest RAID knowledge on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and margin of manoeuvre necessary to enable and promote the personal initiative."
The new regulation will relate to access to new academic cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles have been examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies across the federal territory that depend on the accreditation board established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted a certain pressure on the Länder to weigh the agencies so that the programmes were not too charged and the examination scheme was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized higher schools have already agreed with their regional departments to take appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only country to have agreed to provide more means for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities need to organize tutorial programsset to strengthen educational guidance offices, examination offices and international relations service
The Länder and universities plan a budget of 10 million euros.
In early 2010, the Government wishes to submit an amendment to the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
Following this, only one exam will be required to complete its studies.
The organization of studies will need to be more flexible, and the recognition of notes from other higher education institutions must be guaranteed and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studiability" of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition once again discussed the issue of the study conditions in the country.
The decisions have been appreciated, but critics have been heard.
The Federal President of the Socialist Student Union said he would wish that the organization of educational policy will no longer take place in the future "behind the closed doors" of Ministers and university rectores.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as affected persons should be able to express themselves a little bit.
The future higher education diplomats were supported by the Chairman of Rector Conference Delegates (HRC) Margret Wintermantel: "The student experience is very useful to us," she said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with which the HRC works on a common reform project.
For the Education and Science union (GEW) decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and possibility for each graduate Bachelor to enroll in a Master cycle.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks the Länder to ensure today’s Bachelor’s students, that tomorrow there will be enough seats for Master’s degree and as good as possible.
Therefore, the Länder need to hire more classmates.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of easing access to the Master.
More than one footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words "Arriving in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that a work of the poet Werner Söllner begins, in which he thematizes in bribes of disturbing phrases, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in Banat in Romania in 1951, was first a professor of German and English in Bucharest and subsequently director of collection in an editorial house for youth before setting up in Frankfurt on the Main.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the highly encouraged chair of poetry at the Goethe University of Frankfurt, and since 2002 he was director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the Mousonturm artist house in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a conference in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror deforming your Securitate records".
Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he recognized before his colleagues of German-Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate Police.
In 1989, Söllner received the German language award together with some of the participants.
The enrollment trials began insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, “so someone who has not sufficiently been able to resist the intimidation trials of the Security.”
Werner Söllner is informator Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honor of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its exemplary literary defects with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken, and in particular the community of German authors originating in Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abnormality and lowness of a political system based.
Werner Söllner is not only guilty but also victim, as much as we can say today's knowledge.
In his own Securitate record, IM Walter played a role, assures literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner’s confession and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interviewed in his favour.
“He had been able to get it out of all the difficult situations at the time,” said Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before this audience was unexpected, however, the confession of a former dissident of his collaboration with Romanian secret services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the Securitate spyers who had already written Herta Müller in the newspaper "Die Zeit" in July, after reading the 914 pages of her own record.
It may be assumed that the victims will have done speculation and sometimes have guessed which real names last hid the borrowing names of Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
In contrast to Germany, where the consultation of the Stasi files between times is a reliable process, the attitude towards the inheritance of the Securitate files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been constantly counteracted and braked in the past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was established to work on the assimilation of the Archives of the Securitate (CNSAS), but the return of the files has rather drawn.
Since 2005 there is a law that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very large, is confirmed by the interview of a former responsible for the Securitate in Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed itself very disappointingly towards the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she had only been asked once.
The shame of power thought it could be expressed here, without any gene, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Certainly, many inevitable questions are associated with the Söllner case as so often happens in a hidden guilt context.
Why now? Who has been spoiled? The listeners' weighted reaction, at Söllner's acknowledgement, hope that the following chapter will be defined more by the thirst of knowing than by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On Herta Müller’s work, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a note at the bottom.
Tumults in the Champions League
It was the impression that a representative arrived there, fired at four pins right from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports items manufacturer had spread his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross climbed at midnight at less the quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he just called, an orange plastic bag from the hand-held supplier.
The man, whose hollow skull attracted attention, let himself drive into the city that was still alien to him.
Otherwise our five-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he hadn’t drinked alcohol and he wasn’t drunk of happiness either.
He had spent a nice evening but tomorrow he had to go back to work.
Because it's now that it's going to start.
Switzerland’s words that were just engaged three days earlier were clear: “We reached the eighth final,” that is, in the Champions League with our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania, but we should not let ourselves blind with success. This will be a brutal struggle not to fall back.”
The “great work” is waiting for us on Sunday.
This is about repeating in Mainz the results of the Champions League on a daily basis.
And weaknesses that resurfaced after the three shipping goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Draw to the lot
The eighth final of the Champions League (match going 16./17. + 23./24 February/return match 9./10. + 16./17 March) will be shot on December 18 in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel’s successor’s fulminant entry was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not moderate only in the one who had been lucky, who had transmitted to the destabilized professionals in Stuttgart, a flawless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I was seeing the players and I told them they had to focus on their assets, I advised them to be more brave, explained the "souls leaving" - Gross - the recipe of success that sounded so much but that no longer made effects with the caregiver Babbel.
He triggered some magic, Jens Lehmann – Babbel’s supporter – “in football when there is a new impulse sometimes happens things that we would never have thought possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of break for injury, went to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the “phenomenon” seen by a proverbial “fresh wind” and the method of working the new chief: “It’s someone who goes to action and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
But apparently Babbel missed it.
VfB Stuttgart hasn’t gone through yet, manager Horst Heldt warned
At the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs toughness.
Like Gross, players and managers keep themselves well overassessing the victory against a totally overwhelmed and weakened defense of Romanian guests.
They also won in Glasgow before four days later had a bad awakening in Leverkusen with 0:4, Khedira objected.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others that were still far away.
We haven't gone through the difficult path yet.
That Heldt on his 40th anniversary didn’t have the heart to celebrate, even after the first home victory for three months, is the weekend events that a television interview with Jens Lehmann’s goalkeeper rebound just before the match started.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, would counter Heldt, in response to Lehmann's criticism.
He accused the leadership of style weakness and said she had decided to change coach under the pressure of puberty fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his free day after the matches was deleted.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness” and Heldt announced the consequences for the goalkeeper.
They no longer risked to become friends for life these two square years.
In any case, they agreed for everything else, that is, without the group’s pre-work by the replaced coach, strong sporting and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “for a great deal in success,” said Heldt and Lehmann in choir – and even the man with the plastic bag acquiested.
Heavyweight World Championship
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson was constantly provoking the challenger verbally and gestually the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds, the Ukrainian defended his World Championship title according to the WBC version.
At the unanimousness of the judges, he put himself on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains its World Championship title.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a victory at the points at the unaminity of judges against American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defends his title with honor since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had already won twice the World Championship title of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, he didn’t succeed in the KO long awaited.
Klitschko, 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, admitted twice his defeat due to injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Arena of Bern, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko mostly wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of its 2.02 meters, to his left.
Johnson, 11 centimeters smaller who, prior to the duel, announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champion's strikes, thus hitting Klitschko into play his dangerous right.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures his hits only rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, having exceeded the distance of the twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in Switzerland before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko as a “vile zombie” who “is not really capable.”
During the weighing Friday, the champion was unable to stop provoking Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from the nose “to be able to see his eyes.”
Fourth victory since Klitschko’s comeback.
Klitschko reinstated in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a nearly four-year break, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and recovered his WBC belt that he had previously had to abandon without fighting.
This year, defending his champion title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the United States.
“I just took a shot in this fight and I’m in perfect form,” Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His rule is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is a champion of the WBO and IBF.
But it is the British David Haye who, having destroyed the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko to be held in September.
It seems that his promotional company plans to play this match at the Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Front assault of the opposition: Head of the Green Parliamentary Group, Jürgen Trittin, accused Minister of Defence Guttenberg of a lie in the case of the Kunduz Affair.
The SPD and La Gauche (the Left) parties ask the Chancellor for the explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on Kunduz's air attack, the opposition reproached the Minister of Defense Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) for deliberately hiding certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a counterfeit" on the deadly strike of two tank trucks last September, the head of the Parliamentary Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, said on Saturday during the ARD chain "Tagesschau" information issue (the 20h newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order of killing was given in total contempt of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in substance, the content of the report that NATO has been read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the objective of the lafrappe was in reality not to destroy the stolen trucks, but to eliminate two major Taliban chefs.
According to NATO’s investigation report, 142 people had been killed or injured during the U.S. air attack launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD, and the Left requested Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to decide in front of the Federal Parliament as soon as possible and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and her colleague from the Green Renate Künast Party are of the view that Ms. Angela Merkel should clearly say whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan Government's policy and whether the Chancellorship, the Army and the intelligence services approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The Chancellor has in no way influenced the army's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
Saturday, voices were increasingly stronger to express doubts on the real reasons for the return of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the Ministry.
According to the newspaper SPIEGEL, the information they sent to Guttenberg about the attack on tank trucks was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have hidden the existence of the NATO report and had hidden some disturbing details from the Minister.
In the surroundings of the two senior officials, however, they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert in the meantime would have requested a clarification of the facts in a mail.
Until now, he has not obtained an answer
On Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these charges and referred to the Federal Parliament's investigation committee that was set up on the next Wednesday to bring light on the facts in question.
The worlds of the dream
Some see, all awake, pictures and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
There is not only in psychic patients, or under the effect of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality confuse.
As long as these phenomena appear during sleep, everything goes very well.
When we’re lying in our dark rooms, we can go without barriers to the crazy dreams and fantasies.
However, whoever awakens, experiences a dream state, hears and sees things others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in psychic patients or under the effect of the drug.
It is our imagination that is in question: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels, but that sometimes encourages the limits between dream, madness and reality to melt.
A conscious state of awakening, taking the form of a dream, can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best case it is called visions, at the worst of madness.
But even though the trigger and the effect are distinguished, the visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the New Age Prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the shamans, psychosis and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or deliries when the balance, neurotransmitting substances of the brain - first of all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and achetylcholine - breaks and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and deliberate thoughts manifest very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
The earthly attraction force no longer has power on the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always been looking at the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, the hallucinations were a form of dream-evening; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, founded in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, deliries and sensory illusions that compound."
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T becomes a comic character.
His body is in two dimensions with creating colors.
The earthly attraction no longer has power on him, he plans in the roof.
He feels a shot.
Behind him, devil creatures wing, grinding, bloody mouth, showing the teeth.
They pursue him, hit him with heavy flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
Tonitruous, evil voices, shouting, coming out of the walls and radio.
He can no longer bear those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. removes two cables from its stereo chain, makes a loop and attaches it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
It climbs on a baffle and goes the loop around the neck.
He jumps.
The loop goes off.
Let it be a lesson for you, shouting the voices in a choir to remove the tampon from it. "Go to a clinic and get careful!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two-year-old, the first nearly 20-year-old.
It was triggered by the LSD.
Diagnosis: schizo-affective, paranoid psychosis, in addition, it is maniaco-depressive, it takes medications against depression, mania, schizofrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despairs.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
Approximately one percent of the population suffers at least once in their life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, people concerned can no longer make the difference between the inner world and the outer world, they find themselves in a state of hyper-excitation, which cause them to suffer from hallucinations, megalomany, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment, or dialog.
Optical hallucinations are not rare either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the sludges to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the psychiatry department of CHU in Heidelberg (General Psychiatrice im Universitätsklinikum).
Schizophrene is located at the heart of the situation, all with a focused meaning on it.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act actively on them.
This is why schizophrenes often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general, they do not have the opportunity to adjust reality, the illusions are a cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Make the experience once in his life of a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, “the sensory and space structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is basically preserved.”
Delirant thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, alienation of life takes place in a real setting.
Why our brain makes this kind of cabrioles, is always an enigma for researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to lose the perception of reality momentarily, according to Fuchs.
But only a few people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
The researchers suppose that those concerned have minor brain injuries.
Neuronal maturity of the brain is assumed to be disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what still remains unexplained is how the abnormality of the neural system occurs and furthermore the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience can be a psychosis trigger, if there is predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain is warm.
What's crazy, Lübeck's psychology professor Erich Kasten tells us, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy highly expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of the illusions is often just a matter of view.
Kasten has gathered reports on the hallucinations and phenomena of illusory images for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Heads".
Hallucinations are much of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses but also of an impressive number of many other pathologies.
Among them are psychic disorders such as borderline or depression but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or skull trauma.
It is surprising to note that under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that treat sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently refreshed; when our brain is heated but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, love grief or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of the participants recognize that they have done the hallucination experience at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomerania and goes to high school.
A young girl who is normal to really say.
If there were no pictures and voices.
During the recreation, it happens that a thin, long-castillous boy speaks to him.
When she answers her friends look at her, surprised – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think that this shy girl is a louder dreaming, but Sarah K doesn’t dream, she is sure.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence momentarily.
It is a pleasant feeling, she finds this young friendly.
Are I crazy?, ask she sometimes.
But she knows that this young man and the other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
At night the appearances are generally scary.
Often visions are heavy.
When she is in class, it is sometimes that she cannot follow the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is visiblely explaining equations in the painting.
At night the appearances are generally scary.
When, in the dark of her bedroom, she awaits sleep that comes too rarely and too late, she often cannot make the distinction whether she is awake or dream already, whether the images she sees, grimning faces or the girl with bloody enclosure on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Let me be quiet, she cries to these creatures.
She doesn’t talk about it to her parents or friends, they would take her as a crazy one.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She had her box last year and lived with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she entered into contact with the psychologist Kasten, she knows very well that she's not crazy.
Madness is also an artwork of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or has not enough stimulations, the likelihood is great that he has hallucinations after a while.
I suppose that the brain is not busy enough, making sure there is animation.
Sarah K., a single daughter, was afraid of the other children when she was young and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned when she was 13, that the man she called Dad, since she was an age of thinking, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that are formed in the brain, so that’s why they seem so real.”
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally distinguished from those in acute psychoses.
In contrast to schizophrines, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That’s why Kasten advises his patients to appreciate hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness, unfortunately, we tend quickly to take the imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and doctor head of the Florence Nightingale Hospital’s psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful illness but also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of so-called oniroid experience, a particular form of the change of consciousness awakened by dream.
Oniroid lives are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot distinguish from the dream even when he is in a state of awakening.
The state of oniroid consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully aware, experience a motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental limit between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world takes place, but the real situation is represented in imagination.
In fact, it is an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, an organizational capacity that is given to us, men, to not fall into the nonetheless of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in memories.
The Zurichian Peter Cornelius Classen, art historian, also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Change of Heart" as a safeguarding action of the soul.
He is 49 years old, when his conscious departs for a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain immobile in reanimation.
Claussen plunges into a world he has created from all parts, visits foreign places, travels in time. He sees himself as an old man alied in a railway sanatorium, a robot with his head watching his health.
He lives in the middle age among nobles who manufacture blood drugs.
He is kidnapped by a bicycle Greek who takes him to his country, he surfing with his hospital bed in the Alps snow and meets a Korean mafia.
He absorbs completely into this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these inner travels are fundamentally distinguished from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes by describing what he has experienced.
In contrast to dreams, the memories from mental trips are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intense than real life.
The intensity of this experience broke the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oniroid deliries, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a standby state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten "can cause a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.

At the age of 27, children will take the follow-up of the edition house.
The appointment of Kallen as CEO of Burda Editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wishes that his two children take back the press group, he told Spiegel.
The holding must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - Long-term publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and are firmly determined to integrate the company, 69-year-old Hubert Burda said in the Spiegel.
All details were set in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will be raised later.
We must also see if they are able to do so.
You cannot impose your children on 7,500 employees without knowing whether they have the ability to take care of them.
This would destroy children as well as the company.
Burda had reported last Thursday that he retired from the post President-General Director-General as of January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first responsible for the technology sector.
Afterwards, he dealt with the Treasury sector, that is, he was responsible for the company’s capital and after Jürgen Todenhöfer’s departure, he also took head of marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
Thus for the first time it is not a family member who is head of the Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 respectively, his son Felix who was today 42, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s appointment also serves to link the next 10 or 15 years.”
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% in the family’s hands.
The ruins have always occurred in families that have left themselves induced by a capital bulimia, which have made huge unfortunate speculation by thinking they could rise ever higher.
That has never been my strategy.
I have never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I am absolutely not in the role of the country's preceptor as it could be Springer and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like the Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Integral beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at hand reach.
This is the goal that El Corte Inglés has set itself together, which has just opened in the shopping centre of Callao, Madrid, a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious signs such as Hedonai, specialist in laser removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation and aesthetic treatment rooms, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a sports hall, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding radius, with in particular a tea salon, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you, among others, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or renting the relaxation area for two hours to organize your own “Beauty Party” with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a champagne cup.
In total, these are 250 m2 distributed into 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body care and hydrotherapy.
For example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrant platforms.
The sports hall also features these devices, as well as virtual “trainers” that guide the steps of customers, offering them fully personalized treatment.
Everything starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly perform our exercise program.
His director ensures that 15 minutes (including warming and stretching) are sufficient to make all the muscles of the body work.
And if after we have made our body work, we want to go through the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi sign has a room where we offer rituals for hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all customized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the words of this urban spa, which will be open every day from 10am to 22pm in the year.
Various decollers
Christmas approaches and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the decollete, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables we need to take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated decollete. This is not very advised.
Endesa and Barcelona, equipped with electric car
The electrical company Endesa, in collaboration with the Ayuntamiento de Barcelona, created the “Oficina LIVE”.
This is a project aimed at developing and promoting electric vehicles in the Catalan capital.
The “Oficina LIVE” (Electric Vehicle Implantation Logistics) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the installation of the electric vehicle in the city and establish mobility agreements, by conducting steps, coordinating, submitting, etc.
Furthermore, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "Electric Cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government as part of the MOVELE Plan to launch the installation of the electric car.
Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative to which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company takes part in European standardization groups and has a set of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero offers “a future of tranquility” for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, demonstrates “a future of tranquility” for the Spanish automobile industry, which, he recalled, is the country’s leading export sector.
In the presentation of the Government Chairman’s Economic Report for 2009, Zapatero recalled the steps taken by the executive over the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without a plan for competitiveness in the automotive sector, we would have a landscape of abandonment, closing some of our main production sites today,” the president said.
“Through this plan and the decision of the brands to stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can consider a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our leading export sector,” he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including the Integral Plan for the Automotive Sector (IPA), has spent EUR 800 million on projects from 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which have mobilized an investment of more than EUR 3,000 million.
The chief executive explained that this investment was intended for both the development of new models and the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, established in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan has reduced average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6% and has contributed to a “heavy increase” in registrations, which increased by “40%” in November.
20,000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Salon of collection cars, a meeting space for professionals and passionates of the engine world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pavilion de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
These are an exhibition surface of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can you find motorcycles and collection cars, but you can also find items of all kinds related to the engine world at ClassicAuto Madrid.
Thus, among the pavilion exhibitors, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, reviews, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will make the happiness of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restaurant, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sale and restoration, or Cochera Clásicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Outdoor ability test
But the commercial activity of this fair will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, ability tests, presentations and contests.
Suit tests with automobiles and collection motorcycles will also take place on a circuit arranged outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A Sustainable Sports Spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sports mind is not angry with respect for the environment.
For this purpose, it has just integrated on the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, called i-Stop, a device that at least for now is only available on the gasoline engine 2.0 of 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note she obtained as a whole.
Details, vehicle finish, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving station, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touch of the wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the assembly formed by the control table and the console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, that of the Honda Civic.
That’s why we can say that as well as the Mazda3 as the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the weirdness of German products, and more particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
This compact Japanese car has a more than sufficient habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
It adds to all this a large safe in regular shapes.
The automatic shut-off and start-off system of the engine, at least for now, is only available on the two-liter and 150-horse gasoline engine and with six-speed manual change.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its fineness, low noise, performance and control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most requested Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not perform a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, i.e. the one that has the largest number of series elements.
Among the series equipment, the Road Change Assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed controller, photosensitive interior mirror, dashboard on a large screen, parking sensors, particularly independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth, as well
Furthermore, as if this equipment wasn’t enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for more than 1,500 euros, includes, among others, elements of bi-xenon adaptable lights and a BOSE audio system with disk charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of the materials used, its behavior and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not run a lot of kilometers per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the gasoline engine 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which is between € 21,770 for the Luxury finish and € 23,270 for the tested model, the Sportive.
In contrast to this important sum, the Mazda3 will offer us a large dose of satisfaction every day.
"First" Luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality incarnated by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars are more blind than ever, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the outlet of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as used, had chosen a dark lady.
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows to watch its email, without offering the possibility of only seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the Internet.
He benefited from his five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine designated him as one of the products of the year.
In fact, it is harder to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low monthly price and subscription, which is less than half of what costs, for example, the iPhone subscription date.
Given its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American grandfather, but has a surprise.
The monthly subscription price, approximately €12, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those traveling with a Smartphone already know what the fact of wasting data means when you cross a border or desperately searching for a cafeterie on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to check out your mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it has long been to work.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but with regard to me, I would need to have made a physics thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
The repeated reminders of the European Commission's order to propose affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a barely perceptible effect.
Outside the country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it’s always curious that it’s called Fon while it doesn’t have the Wi-Fi) offers this type of rates, means that operators begin to think differently and study different proposals that allow them to profit their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No subscription and no gallery.
It is a connected device and it is paid when purchasing and not every month.
And this is what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: an option for purchasing with life access as Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just wish it because I believe it is a more just formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is probably the favorite colour of the first lady in the United States.
If she went to the presidency of Barack Obama with a dress and coat of this color, she has in fact chosen the same to accompany her in the second moment, undoubtedly, the most important of her life: the grant to Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama was wearing a very similar model in these two occasions: in addition to their look-like color, a yellow pulling towards green with bright reflections, both times, the outfit was composed of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large embroidery or a necklace.
While at first glance, it seems that the first lady in the United States follows the sealing of the Princess of Asturias and chose to regain the same costumes.
But the fabric in which the two assemblies are cut makes them very different.
If it was a thick toothpack for the taking of function, on the other hand, it was wearing a printed velour in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green medium heel shoes for the first occasion, and a similar, but golden model, this time.
The hairstyle also changed: the hair is now raised as she weared them the previous time.
75% of mothers who work had professional problems due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women in young generations who want to be mothers.
This is what reveals the study "Women's Fecundity and Professional Career in Spain", conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, carried out on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no doubt: 75% of mothers who worked have seen their career limited due to motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, whether or not the woman works and the type of occupied job.
Those who do not have any activity outside the home, work part-time, or have unstable work, become couple earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier, and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, repeat entry into life as a couple and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women aged 35 to 49 years of fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after settling in couples. This figure grows to 4.1 among women working in the public sector. "This data shows that women with a stable job needed more time in their lives to get it, which led them to repulse the union and arrival of children.
Furthermore, the type of employment exercised largely influences maternity, but less the date of beginning of common life,” explains the researcher at CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that exaggerates the difference from the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the investigation, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference also remains among women of one generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years old, those who studied elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years average, respectively.
Another distinction also appears among women, depending on their level of study.
While those who have done elementary studies get married and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have done a medium or higher level studies reverse this program and give priority to obtaining stable work as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child,” says Mrs. Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will incarnate the image of several products of the brand, toning the universal motto “Because I’m well worth it.”
The protagonist of Joyeux Christmas, one of the most elegant actress in the international scene, thus joins other celebrities registered at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if selected were the actress Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
In men, the cosmetics brand also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, lessons of anatomy) and Matthew Fox (company of Evangeline in Lost).
Prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His biggest representatives, designers and models, yesterday and today, met for the annual reward of their awards, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best model of the year.
The As Poker by Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de Ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographs" of writers who have crossed his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
It does not according to the predictable and captured genres (biographic summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the core of ignition of the created character.
The trip is exciting and Vincent does not save fears or illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also an emotional invitation to reading and reading.
I'll leave you a few instantanees here.
In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, impulse that I felt without naming it: pleasure against destiny, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god.
Samuel Beckett said: “Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in his head, between impotence and ignorance, with a poetic humour shining, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him.”
On Graham Greene, “Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion lasting thirteen years, in the flesh of which he conjugated the emotion of adultery to the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition.”
On James Joyce: “L’Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the peaks of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north face, on which the best alpinists are still and always taken.”
William Faulkner: “He was a strange guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heirs of a land owner of the county and other times that he was the son of a black and crocodile.
These two dreams were great.”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: “This writer gathered the cry from a bridge by this Munch character to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century, in his literary form, and made it in the fleeing of himself and invoking post-periority with a violent speech to astics.”
On Dorothy Parker, “One day she kneeled and prayed, ‘God beloved, I beg you to stop writing like a woman.’”
On Joseph Conrad, “Spenser’s worms were engraved on his grave: ‘Sleep after effort,/ after storm the port,/ rest after war,/ after life, death tired.’”
Virginia Wolf: “In her luggage she also carryed her depressions.
Her husband accepted very normally that she tells her that Edouard VII screamed him between the Azaleans or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man such a patient and in love with a neurosis whose literary talent exceeded madness.”
On Pio Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do unless it is trying to hide Joyce at Baroja?
What is Essaya Benet unless it is to shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What did it do unless it was to aspirate the glory of this man to serve him as a piedestal?
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70, was walking through our city neighborhood of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 went next to her and our dog, a slender blood, saved from the SPA and weighed no more than six pounds, and without saying a word, they had two shots left the dog gripped.
Our indignation is enormous because we do not see what is fun to attack a little undefenseless animal free of charge which, in addition, was in leash.
To this one must add the indignation of a lady who walked quietly and when she insulted these individuals, it came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energy that attacks an animal is capable of doing the same to a woman, a child, an old person, or ultimately any person weaker than him.
The episode took place at around 7 p.m., on Tuesday like another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog has twinned all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint to the neighborhood police office even if we doubt that this is a great deal and not touching the sensitivity, we just want to clarify that the cowards murderers were Spanish.
The indignation led us to denounce this fact.
We don’t understand what happens with young people so they find fun to treat an undefenseless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us companion.
We do not know where the right education and respect for animals and people has passed.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for helmet wearing
Tire manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage helmet wearing, mainly among the youngest motorcyclists, as the two structures today indicated.
This initiative aims to make aware of the importance of helmet wearing, as it is the only protective element to avoid head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheel accident.
Michelin stated that this campaign was part of its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond the design and manufacturing of ever-secure products” and stated that it contributed to this objective through other educational and informative actions.
This new encouragement campaign for two-wheel helmet wearing, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase in which posters will be distributed into more than 500 motorcycle garages, to ensure the broadest streaming.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety “is a constant concern” for the company, as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever-secure products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles progress
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008, and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 months consecutive decline, according to the figures of the manufacturer's employer union Anfac and Ganvam, that of dealerships.
However, the good news should be nuanced, since the reference to comparison in November 2008 was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the rebound of last month, registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from tourism cars, pick-ups, vans, light trucks and light chassis trucks) have been sold 95,853.
The large clouds that most affect their demand have not dissipated, because, although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in nearly 100% of the cases through external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in the limitation of bank credits, other factors such as the increase in unemployment rate or the persistence of poor economic conjunction must be added.
In the face of this situation and the difference in tourism vehicles, the 2000E purchasing aid was little used.
In addition to individuals, independents and SMEs who wish to purchase a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, can also benefit from this, but the number of operations speaks of itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, we recalled the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealer association provides for a 2010 year similar to that that ends, for which it calculates a 19% drop in sales (tourism vehicles and 4x4).
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As this happened with the ABS brake anti-blocking system and as this will happen with the ESP stability control, emergency brake aid systems will constitute a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory for newly registered tourist cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been set until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the European Union is to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, although by its mode of action it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of emergency detected by the system thanks to the driver's foot hit.
But it doesn’t always maintain pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the Bosch car component manufacturer, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to press the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from all its strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in revanch, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance the car needed to stop.
According to a EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1,100 mortal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: one in four injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects the obstacles and prevents the driver, in addition to slightly acting on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps it by increasing pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exercises the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors Returns Plan for Opel Until January
While Opel factory workers were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably 8 – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time for relief.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, considers that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to workers and then to governments of the countries where the plants are located, will be deferred until early 2010.
On the other hand, GM ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has stretched the pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them might be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the Dutch Skyper sports car manufacturer’s application, supported by the Russian Converg group, takes importance.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if not sold is maintained.
On the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and valuable jewelry, Porsche’s engineers left the Boxster S and managed to slim down nothing less than 80 pounds, leaving the balance only at 1,275 pounds.
This caused them to take place, firstly, from the automatic roof that was replaced by a manual blanket roof, allowing to reduce by 21 pounds, to use aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 15 pounds less, to remove the air-conditioner, 13 pounds light, to reduce the gas tank from 64 to 54 pounds, and 12 pounds of sports.
Finally, they resigned the CDR-30 audio system, thus winning six other kilograms and replaced the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the double-clutch PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on roads of the California secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly turbulent turns.
Its behavior can only be qualified as irreproachable.
Weight reduction does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with lead.
On the contrary, for a long time we had not tested such a small and lightweight model that at the same time guarantees so much safety in the turns, including at high speed.
He is a little athlete, capable of warming his muscles at a small speed for the necessary time, until we asked him to sprinter, brake, recover and push his engine again...
That's what we wanted out. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as precise, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the wheel.
And it will do it with surgical accuracy.
Sound of engine at will
The sound of the V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be reinforced with the “sport” option or thanks to a system that changes the roaring of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The accelerating capacity is brutal, whether it is stopped or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The coating of the roads we travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car well managed the chicken nests.
The electronic assistants barely acted in presence throughout the journey, while on some turns we found verglass in the morning and gravels later in the morning.
Ultimately, an ultra-light car, the most entertaining to drive and which is much more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be launched for sale in February 2010, at a price of €70,831.
"Bag Girl"
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the parades of the house, the singer shows her face as bad girl with as much content as her Chanel bags.
More than a "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", it's a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia is a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral gained a brilliant triumph at 91-82 during his visit to Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous absence of Dusko Ivanovic’s team suffering. It is thus leading its group, after Mirza Teletovic’s big show, which, with eight three-point basket, was the best of its team (29 assess).
The Vitoria team was able to fill the important absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of engagement and collective work, even if it had to wait until the end to win the victory.
Furthermore, the great skill since the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three points marked, largely determined the final victory.
The match began quickly for the blue and red, which took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked since the perimeter was supposed to have jumped on the Israeli field with hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the leading craftsmen of the 18-20 final of the first quarter time.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but the Alava team chose Barac's inner game and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by acclamations and applauses back to his former home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to be noticed as the best player in his team, with 13 points scored, although the “less six” Splitter rating already left to predict that this night would not be the best of Brazilians.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right path to the break, nothing was played, far away from there, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria's one that we didn't win so easily on their field, and thanks to "Elias' hand," they succeeded in entering the match.
Eidson and Pnini decisively contributed to the advantage of the yellows over the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
The players of Ivanovic, wounded but far from being dead, needed to chain some skillful actions to take air, and it was at that time that Mirza Teletovic's mitraillette emerged that, with three consecutive three-point basket and the help of English and Ribas, transferred the counter to a reassuring score (54-67-67) at the end.
Avala's team went out to play all for the whole during the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they wouldn't let anyone take what they deserved during the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support it from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, Ivanovic players did not hurry, defended well, and although the Israelis had approached in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped in Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from delivering battle
The Unicaja lost noisy in Greece in the face of the Olympiacos and gave him the head of Group B of the Euroliga, during a match marked by the absence of Unicaja players, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not afraid of the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship flag or the rival’s largest, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and having a large budget.
The game of the first quartertime allowed the Andalus to dream, an aggressive defense and three consecutive three-point basket, two of Omar Cook’s manager and one of Guillem Rubio’s who flawed the local team 12-18 at the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the Bourousis internal game Vujcic and Schortsanitis, has allowed to overthrow the score 22-20, at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of fighting, between the two North American leaders and Beverley players had the dispelling William.
The Greek team began to work by showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit for injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez were weighing on the Unicaja.
Interior players and Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas, with their three-point basket, dig the advantage 44-32, at the nineteenth minute.
An impossible rise
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos, which, despite the 19 losses, was higher and even equal the difference in the match in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, causing the group's head.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absence and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to its organization, the three-point basket from Cook, and the support of Lewis, left a little hope with 66-57, at the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was almost impossible because the Olympiacos showed itself implacable when the players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score back to 81-62, at the thirty-seventh minute, and the Unicaja submitted, accepting the Olympiacos victory.
How much should you be paid based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new Trovit app, the search engine with the largest number of real estate, job and vehicle ads in Spain.
The “How much should you be paid?” tool calculates the salaries of users from more than 140,000 job offers that Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you need to register your profession, years of experience, age and the city you want to work.
Since a week the application has been operating, the search engine has detected that the Spanish worker as a rule “feel poorly paid,” Trovit product manager Albert Ribera said in a statement.
Based on the data Trovità available from its search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the least well paid.
A British computing programmer receives 45,226 euros annual gross and a French, 31,059 euros, while a Spanish receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives EUR 34,247 annual gross in England, EUR 25,751 in France and EUR 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well paid work in Spain is the server, with 11,592 euros annually net, followed by the seller, with 14,725 euros, and the worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most searched jobs on the Internet over the last three months are driver jobs, half-time jobs and social worker jobs.
Brazil sets a date for departure from Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overthrown president will have to abandon the diplomatic legacy by 27 January 2010, date of the official end of his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, a business officer of the Brazilian embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed at TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been refugee since September 21, before that date.
“He is aware that he must leave on January 27, after his mandate, he must look for another destination.”
The channel also quoted the former official, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the established deadline: “My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government,” Zelaya said by phone.
After the 29th November elections (during which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
The same week, however, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed, since Zelaya refused the condition of political exile intended to impose it on the Government of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
After rose days since last spring, during which the inflation of assets has been the dominant rating on the markets, uncertainty arises again, which is not surprising, since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions on a future by nature uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt by direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving abundant liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to be mobilised.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been practically completed and, without challenging their non-conformistic liquidity policy, start putting a little sand in the roads, as the ECB has done, with their procurement one year next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are now attending a reverse of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of scholarships and the differences in corporate bonds increase again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize the private risk and the public debt is again affected.
There is once again a flight towards quality and the United States, Japan and Germany were the investor’s choice of shelters, causing an increase in differences between the euro zone countries and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor'sa threatened a new decreasing revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of the moral risk, who were again trying to cause a case of consciousness among the responsible for global economic policy that had hindered the destructive effects of the limitation of credit on the destruction of employment, while what should be made is a new day of grace.
However, the situation in Dubai looks like a tribal struggle between the Emirates to return its place to power in the Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that dissimulates a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot of roses.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational that Ecofin saves Hungary from a failure to comply with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allows a member of the eurozone to fail to comply with its commitments.
On the other hand, it is logical that the Ecofin has induced the Greek government to transparency and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we face an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our differences in public debt increase to the extent of European corporate obligations, we don't have to worry about it.
If European differences decreased and ours continued to increase, it would then be an idiosyncrasic Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators require most studies to anticipate their relaunch models and to revise their forecasts for 2011, in addition to the OECD and the European Commission, which return to warning with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not hope much.
Again, it all seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for the moment “caution is mother of surety.”
Connected sectors
President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the Congress of MEPs’ subcommittee, where Spain’s energy strategy for the next two decades is discussed these days.
Following his intervention, followed by the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán skied for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommission, at eight-close.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50,000 million until 2020 and EUR 60,000 million more between this date and 2030, in the case that nuclear power plants today are still open.
If that is not the case, the necessary investments would not be 60,000 million but 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola believes that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increased production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue will change, and it will need to increase power.
Its betting focuses on both gas and coal plants, with mechanisms for recovery of carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this field, he considers that more than 18,000 MW are needed, along with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the Government's recent approval of the Sustainable Economy Act is in the line of what its business claims, did not wish to attack the royal decree to encourage national coal consumption, which contradicts global warming policies.
According to him, there is a “clear long-term bet” in this sense, despite the “pointed” measures, as Iberdrola’s president has qualifyed.
In any case, Galán believes that decisions to invest, although they are long-term, must begin to be taken, because they take some time before reaching their maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial gains Aer Lingus handling market at ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, Ferrovial’s subsidiary for airport services on land, will play the role of a privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for goods services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are one of the most important ones.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaboration protocol to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance expects an investment of 20 million until 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the center is to conduct energy efficiency research on highways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first highway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona fights for its first concession road in Australia, a market on which she already works as a energy company and water manager.
The building is an estimated tunnel of 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5 kilometres long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East coast, this is the option to allow Acciona to establish in the country as a public work company and highway dealership.
The city town hall wishes to be able to make it available by the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, within the framework of a business plan under Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be charged with the construction and tax operation.
In waiting for the presentation of their offers in May, the planned investment amounts to $1,700 million in Australia (about €1,047 million) and in the last phase three consortiums, with a remarkable presence of European manufacturers.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, a only Spanish smooth company, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European underground work specialists.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French manufacturer group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that passed the trial is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between Australian Leighton (the company of German manufacturer Hochtief, who in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Wales company specialized in public work, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large buildings and privatizations, but entering it is a great difficulty, except by the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by Hochtief and Bilfinger companies, in addition to their Asian references, which remains an unvalid step for Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just gained a place in this market with its 30% share in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona placed on a geographical area of great importance for the sector, on which it already has a wide presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalinization sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, that of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the grouping of companies responsible for erecting and managing the Adelaide desalinizer, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to benefit from synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The underground road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Bureau and the Northern Link, is called to connect the western Toowong Highway to the peripheral road to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometers of tunnel. This is the largest existing project to reduce traffic encounter in Brisbane.
The schedule set by the administration indicates that the tender will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this tax path will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will comprise twice two paths, an electronic tax system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will bring 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make widely fruitful Hochtief, which mentioned yesterday the achievement of a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national fiber optical broadband network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have quick Internet access and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company granted the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the city of Brisbane. The work has not started yet and Hochtief concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, more specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, is awarded the construction of a tunnel of 2.1 kilometres long for a motorway in Slovenia, for EUR 64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after being charged with the expansion work of the Bosruck tunnel, Austria, for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the plant is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and it will take 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore is awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore, for a budget of approximately three million euros a year, the rail operator said.
The contract refers to the possibility of two 12-month extensions each. Mrs. Rushmore has been chosen from 16 agencies that have submitted to Renfe's bidding, four of which have been finalists, including TBWA who has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of campaigns.
63 million fines to France Télécom to break competition
The French competition regulator inflicted a fine of €63 million to France Télécom for its anti-competitive conducts in the Caribbean region belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephone by signing exclusive agreements, rates and consumer loyalty programs on the margin of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state firm, has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it puts to its competitors.
Yesterday's sanction was increased because the competition-keeping authority considers France Télécom committed similar offences in the past and is therefore repeated.
A App Store
On the other hand, the French company's mobile phone subsidiary followed the seal of other operators and opened an Internet application store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Originally, the Orange App Store will be active in France and the UK.
We will need to wait for 2010 until it arrives in other countries like Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has reported 476.4 million in Real Madrid and Barça since its creation.
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs since its birth in 1992.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have won 467.4 million, which places them in the third and fifth position of clubs that have taken the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is leading the list.
Manchester United is leading the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
Indeed, the competition has allocated €5,362.5 million to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament during the 1992-1993 season, according to the UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have been well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third in the continent touching the most money for its participation, and the only, with A.C. Milan, has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently held the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
Manchester United and Munich Bayern are the top list, the two teams who also charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they have lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in terms of the money returned by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for the distribution of money applied by the UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
From this amount, the UEFA will spend 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in classification matches (with which the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million only to be there, plus 550 00 euros for each game played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighths of the final receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the quarter of the final receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, faced with the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, for fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1 million, and at a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça packed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which are dedicated 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four attractive seats.
The previous year's champion pockets 40% of the allocated money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid based on the number of matches played during the edition of the current year.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa Group listed yesterday details of the purchase offer of shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos’ capital.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a public acquisition offer (OPA) for all securities.
Concretely, Nueva Rumasa offers €1,5025 per share, which will be paid in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this delay.
Yesterday, Sos’ shares ended at €1.85; Nueva Rumasa’s offer is therefore assessing the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual assessment of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerez Group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to indicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV assured that it was not informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If appropriate, the payment would be 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues the restructuring of his leadership.
In an attempt to stay outside of possible purchase offers and going and comes judicial from its former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes it the first woman to occupy a leadership position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will directly depend on the chairman of the group.
And it is not free of controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos towards the Salazar companies.
In addition, the possibility that in the coming months Sos reveals new funding deflections cannot be deleted.
Regarding the Salazar credit, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Hearing that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV Authorizes Paternina's Exclusion OPA Submitted by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorized yesterday the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were adjusted to the applicable standards and that it considered the contents of the explanation sheet presented "sufficient" following the amendments applied on 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which accounts for 8.95 % of the capital capital, composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to negotiation on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been mobilized and that they could not be transmitted in any way before the completion of the offer, which he indicated that the price was set by Federico Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the current standards.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars who have suffered a sinister are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each sinister is different, and calculating the cost of pieces and work time can constitute a long and complex work.
To calculate by hand the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including the pieces and the workforce can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the most recent computer tools, it would be a question of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
Providers of services and solutions for assessment and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by manufacturers to then process and offer to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex of the North American group Solera is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Managing Director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
Furthermore, the amount of data to be processed is constantly increasing, so in the past five years more versions, variants and motors have been launched than in the past fifteen years.
When a new car comes out of the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very hard work because each of the thousand parts of the vehicle must be cataloged and enrolled in price.
Furthermore, a “intelligent” graphic image of each model can be established, on which you can click on the different parts of a tourist car.
If this is a massively sold model, work can be ready in a week if the process is moving very quickly.
If this is a low-selling car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has comprehensive information about 99.2% of cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have, for example, information about the Porsche, but not the Ferrari or Lamborghini.
As for vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the documentation and database development work, Audatex has eight centers across the globe (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million each year to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most common application relates to repair and maintenance, but depending on countries, there are also tools for managing break parts or for calculating a car’s venal or residual value.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the industry.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard solution for assessment of sinisters for experts.
There are cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint bars.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is €5.75, for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it was out of the assembly chain, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glasses, and AudaSubastas is an open server for the business sector on the Internet that allows you to purchase on declared spawn vehicles.
Its statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, performing geo-demographic analysis, or knowing the common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a specific brand have gone to the garage for a crash or how many serious sinisters have suffered for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the manufacturer’s official parts, prices and time.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a supplier of services and solutions to evaluate sinisters, crashes or carriage maintenance.
The GT Evaluation Guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover increased by 20% a year over the past three years, and it made a turnover of €10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she started her internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and settled in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its revenue is achieved in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are located in Spain.
The global revenue figure of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will amount to $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will earn €19.1 million, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was borrowed in $1,000 million, and today its shares are estimated at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been on the side of the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction of accidental cars
Last October, Solera bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could expand next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to provide more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This estimate and sales service is addressed exclusively to professionals in the industry, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cracks and professional sellers who must be registered before starting operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1,500 sellers and 4,000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
In accordance with Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
The collection cars can be reregistered, although they have been removed, after complex steps.
Four-step garage quote
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user gets a quote in only four steps: identifying the vehicle, searching for the spare part, creating a quote and generating it.
Ease of use is an essential part of these systems, especially to convince the older professionals who, in a larger amount, are reactive to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 all-terrains, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are needed.
Once the template to be repaired is identified with its chassis number, a real graphic image of the template in question appears and then the necessary piece is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the workforce, increases or discounts, then he can print the quote to return it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalog.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include estimated labour times.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
Currently, the Audatex company works to ensure that these images are in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanicians see with a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the internal face.
