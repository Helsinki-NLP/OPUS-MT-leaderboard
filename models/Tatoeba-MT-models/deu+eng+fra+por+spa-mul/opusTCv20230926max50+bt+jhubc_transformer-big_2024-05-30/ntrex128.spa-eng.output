The members of the Assembly (AM) in Wales are concerned to "seem muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are confused with the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of Parliament of Wales (MWP).
This discomfort arises from the plans to change the Assembly's name to Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the whole political spectrum are concerned that this can be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly declared that his group was concerned "that it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, twp means fool and pwp means cake.
A member of the Assembly of the Party of Wales commented that his entire group was “disappointed” and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales claimed that his group was "open" to the change of name, but noted that MWP's pronunciation jump to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Galician is similar to that of the letter u in English of Yorkshire.
The Commission of the Assembly, which currently prepares legislation to introduce the change of name, states: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the members of the Assembly will be a matter of the members themselves."
The Wales Government’s 2017 law granted the Wales Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals that revealed a broad support for calling Parliament of Wales to the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Parliament of Wales (or WMP), but the MWP option obtained most support in a public consultation.
Apparently, members of the Assembly are suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could bring head to the Assembly President Elin Jones, who should send the bill on changes within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as rules on the disablement of members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the last word on the question of how they should be called when they decide on legislation.
Macedonians go to the urns to vote a referendum on country name change
The voters will vote on Sunday whether their country’s name will change to “North Macedonia Republic”.
Popular vote was convened in an attempt to solve a decades-long conflict with the neighboring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a complaint of its territory and has repeatedly opposed its candidate for accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the change of name, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells keep silence for the difficulties of the Harlem churches
"Historically, the elderly people I have spoken with say there was a bar and a church in each corner," Mr. Adams said.
“Today, there is nothing or anything else.”
He pointed out that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“Now people socialize otherwise,” he says.
“The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods to which neighbors go regularly.”
With respect to churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as much as the leaders expect and that "before or later they will return to the starting point."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the type of people who will not help the sanctuaries left in the neighborhood.
“The immense majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and therefore will speed up the closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that most people who move to these apartments will end up being members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation was left in the 30s of the 20th century.
A black congregation who worshipped nearby acquired the building.
A black congregation took St. Martin's rides, under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to 125 street merchants, a main Harlem shopping street, who resisted to hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building seriously damaged and while Father Johnson's happy people made plans for its reconstruction, they also ordered the carrier.
Reverend David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called him “the campaigns of the poor.”
In July, the expert who played the carril called "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
Additionally, expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan noted that he was the world’s first carrier used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to play Riverside Church’s largest carrier 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What happened in St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the parish governing body, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting its concern that the diocese "intends to pass costs" to the board, although it had not participated in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some fellows complained about the lack of transparency by the diocese.
Shark wounded a 13-year-old boy diving in California looking for locusts
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old child on Saturday while diving for locusts in California on the day the locust season was opened, authorities say.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported to San Diego’s KSWB-TV channel that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child asking for help, so he approached with a group to get him out of water.
Hammel commented that at first, he thought he was just excited to have captured a locust, but then he realized he was screaming that they had bitten him.
,
He had the broken clavicule," Hammel observed when he arrived at the child.
"I greeted everyone who left the water because there was a shark," Hammel added.
The child was transported by helicopter to Rady Children’s Hospital, where he is in critical state.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, commented in a press conference that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper zone of the torso.
The authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to the Swami beach, in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's Plans Boost UK Beauty Market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, who have many employees specialized in the corridors of their style and beauty establishments.
In order to significantly boost the UK’s beauty market, valued at 2800 trillion pounds and with growth that is increasing compared to the fall in fashion and home sales, the largest beauty corridors will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successfully surpassed, the same will be done in more stores next year.
Beauty investment comes at the same time as this supermarket chain seeks ways to use the space in shelves that used to be aimed at TVs, microwaves and home manage.
Sainsbury's declared that it would double its beauty offering with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Furthermore, there will be more space for existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees range, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also release its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also test its concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments, the first newly inaugurated in Croydon, southern London, last week. The second will be inaugurated in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online stores and the shift towards the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local stores force supermarkets to strive to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury’s executive director Mike Coupe said shops will be more and more like shopping centers while the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl discount establishments by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury’s has integrated Argos’ discount sales points in hundreds of establishments and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. This is considered to have boosted food sales and more profitable these purchases.
The previous attempt of the supermarket chain to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to split revenues from pharmaceutical sales points in their supermarkets.
The new strategy is raised after the sale of the 281 pharmaceutical establishments from Sainsbury to Celesio, a company owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding a wide range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
As Sainsbury’s business director Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We have transformed the appearance and environment of our beauty corridors in a way that enhances the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available to provide advice.
Our brand offer is designed to suit all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a comfortable location makes us an irresistible destination of beauty products, challenging the old way to buy.”
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby breaks a £11 million deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, went "furious" after Holly Willoughby's television host broke a £11 million deal with her lifestyle business line to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to devote to the fashion brand and add-ons Truly.
This business had compared with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angry with Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, leaving his lucrative lifestyle business in the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was "furious" when the golden girl on television admitted that her new agreements, valued at up to £1.5 million, did not leave time to devote herself to Truly, her fashion brand and add-ons, during a tense meeting held Tuesday at her business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and profiled itself as a favorite to double Willoughby’s fortune of about 11 million pounds.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones left Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As a questioned source said, "Truly was Holly's top priority.
It was going to be her long-term future, which would keep her in the next two decades.
His decision to leave left all the involved entirely shocked.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow’s headquarters, products ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of Britain’s most cost-effective stars, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing, and possibly even further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are fathers of three children and ten years ago they maintain a close relationship with Jones and her wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples were on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin’s television producer.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the I'm A Celebrity program host on the ITV channel.
A source close to Jones claimed that yesterday night “there wasn’t talked about business issues.”
A difficult conversation "and then we fall in love"
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some would consider “little presidential” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump renounced so many things?
Trump commented on his mocking voice of “news presentator.”
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in meeting him again after Trump commended the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a big step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
Nevertheless, negotiations on denuclearization have been stagnated.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s leading diplomat Ri Yong Ho explained to world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see a “suitable response” of the U.S. to the first steps for North Korea’s disarmament.
On the contrary, he said, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump’s perspective was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his midst.
“We’re getting great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to enter war with North Korea.
millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relationships with Kim have generated positive results: the end of missile tests, help to release hostages, and bring the deadly remains of American soldiers back home.
Furthermore, he defended his unusual approach by talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but so, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to enter this full stadium, we would have about 200 people here," Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds of dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their aid was not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had had to move, it did not declare a national emergency, a prerequisite to catalyze international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not request international assistance, which complicates things a bit,” Mrs. Sumbung explains.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team that will send Palu, they are still uncertain whether the foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national emergency agency, explained that authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organizations were allowed to provide aid.
Considering that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country remains incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they do not see so many in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami alert sirenes in Palu, even though there was a prior warning, has contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best case, travelling from one island of Indonesia to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake is headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the enclave of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widododo turned the improvement of Indonesia’s wear infrastructure into the central axis of its electoral campaign, and has dedicated a lot of money to roads and railway lines.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr. Joko, who faces a reelection next year.
In addition, it must deal with the pressure of persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes while bands of Christians and Muslims were fighting on the streets using machets, arches, and other rudimentary weapons.
Daniel Sturridge, from Liverpool, equals the score in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League in front of Chelsea with a goal at the 89 minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri a little more than 27 meters from Chelsea's port when the scorer was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot with a touch before throwing it to the second stick.
The action sent him above the area and moved to the upper right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball passed above Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop him with a jump and fell into the network.
“I was trying to put myself in that position to get myself with the ball and players like Shaq always play ahead, so I tried to give myself all the time possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante came closer and gave him a touch. I didn't think too much, I just shot it."
Chelsea was winning 1-0 in the first half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues midpoint made a tackle pass to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before rotating making a regate near the midfield and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran out in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful pass into the space that led Hazard to the area.
Hazard stands in front of the defense and killed the ball to the second post’s network with a leg with the left foot that Alisson Becker from Liverpool couldn’t stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool will play against Napoli in the Champions League group phase. The meeting will be held at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faces Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Number of Indonesian tsunami victims increases to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and the happening tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as the country’s emergency agency reported early Sunday.
Many people were trapped among the debris of the buildings that collapsed during the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that occurred Friday and released waves of up to six meters, the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with remains of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrests a 32-year-old man as a suspect of murder after a woman was punched up to death
A murder investigation has been opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with knots at Grayson Mews, John Street, which suggested the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect.
Police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard something to go to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in the initial stages, but it would encourage anyone who was near Jonh Street in Birkenhead, who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend anyone, especially taxi drivers, to have captured something in dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our research.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is Birkenhead and found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who believe they met the woman arrived at the crime scene to know where they had found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have informed that they are in the process of informing the victim’s family members.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his floor again, but police tell him no one can enter or leave the building.
He was amazed when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now informed that they will be allowed to re-enter in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in the place in tears.
It repeats "it's terrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cord and one more outside.
Several agents stood within the cord controlling the floor block.
Anyone who has information is requested to send an email to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, registration 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the last commemorative success of "rewriting history"
His prohibition would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s suggestions as a “crazy” and an “attempt to rewrite the story.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: “In the current debate on the elimination of statues, it was inevitable that taking the figure of Oliver Cromwell from the Westminster Palace became a goal.
The iconoclasy of English Civil Wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
It may be sacrificed to the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft from Cromwell is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr. Goldsmith noted to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, a defender of parliament against external pressure, in this case, it is clear, the monarchy.
If this is a completely accurate description, it is a matter of continuing the historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the mid-seventeenth century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a face of that division.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector are also worthy to celebrate and commemorate."
Killer pig attacks Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a Southwest China market, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a sectioned artery and covered with blood near a well of the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig breeder is prepared to inject vaccines to pigs from a well in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
As it seems, he travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby well was open.
He said there was a big pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the nearly 250-pound pig had attacked the farmer until the death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were blooded and broken,” the cousin, who’s headed by his surname, “Wu,” told The Guiyang Evening News.
The images of the security camera showed Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4:40 to feed their pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked to prevent attacking anyone else, while the police collected evidence on the site.
It seems that the Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for their death.
Although they’re rare, it’s not the first time a pig attacks a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at her farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man injured by gravity.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 295-kilogram pig accompanied a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared the animal.
After, in 2012, pigs were eaten at an Oregon farmer, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs do not usually be aggressive, but that the taste of the blood can act as a "schieper."
“They are just playing.
They are like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What you have to do is to have proper respect for them," he said.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane will leave heavy widespread rains in the southwest of the US.
As foreseen, the Rosa hurricane is weakening as it moves over the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains across northern Mexico and southwestern the United States in the next few days.
Rosa caused wind breaks of more than 136 km/h, a category 1 hurricane from Sunday to five in the morning (east time) and was located nearly 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean, low pressures are beginning to be generated, which move eastward to the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to boost heavy tropical rains northwestward to the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will leave more than 25 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain shocks with the low pressure that is approaching, there will be strong widespread rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, flows of debris, and possible debris in the desert.
Heavy tropical rainfall will cause almost 5 to 8 inches per hour rainfall in concrete areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rain is expected between 5 and 10 centimeters in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains, sudden floods may occur under conditions that rapidly worsen.
Due to this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not recommended to adventure in the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn the guns into rivers and storms will cause cracked winds and dust clouds locally.
Low pressures that come near will leave heavy rains in concrete parts of the southern California coast.
Tower rains may leave up to nearly two centimeters of water, which could cause small flows of debris and make roads slide.
It would be the first torrential rainfall in the region during the wet season.
Some dispersed tropical shears will begin to approach Arizona at the end of Sunday and first of Monday, before the rain spreads at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains will spread to the Four Squares on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, severe temperature changes in the U.S. will be observed due to the Arctic cooling and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes, this involves drastic changes in temperature at short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen throughout the U.S. center on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the long summer heat will try to recover and expand again.
In a large part of the center and east of the U.S. is expected an early warm October, with widespread temperatures around 26 degrees from the South Plain to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, in New York, temperatures of up to 26 degrees could be reached, about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high probabilities of temperatures higher than the average for the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh’s appearance
More than 20 million people followed the testimonials that Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of supposedly sexual assault in the 1980s, gave six television channels on Thursday.
Meanwhile, politics continued to be dead and the media interrupted their usual scheduling to retransmit the latest Friday news: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake, so that the FBI can carry out an investigation of the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touched her in a state of drunk and tried to get her clothes off at a school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was totally sure that that hadn’t happened.
More than 20.4 million people who commented on Nielsen are likely to have seen it on Friday.
The company accounted for the media audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has some trouble calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American playoff football match or Oscar awards.
Fox News Channel, whose tertulians have strongly supported the designation of Kavanaugh, fuel the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a day-long appearance, Nielsen said.
ABC occupied second place, with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the appearance, it was still shown a great interest.
Flake was the main character of Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement reporting that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Friday morning the CNN and CBS cameras captured how some protesters shouted on him when he tried to climb to an elevator to attend an appearance to the Judicial Commission.
While receiving these reproaches, broadcast live by the CNN, he showed himself slaughtered.
"Locking in my face," a woman said.
“Do you think you’re telling the truth to the country?”
And he continued: “You have power when there are so many women who don’t have it.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the lift doors were closed, he would tell more things when he appeared before the Commission.
Cable and broadcast television channels broadcast everything live hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's candidate to the Senate to vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate over the next week, which had been asking for some Democrats.
Flake was convinced, in part by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision was crucial, as it was clear that Republicans wouldn’t have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation regarding allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “making politics” with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of their plan to leave the European Union for “doing politics” with Britain’s future and undermining national interest in an interview with Sunday Times.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May will be held Congress of the Conservative Party to be held in Birmingham, Great Britain on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published alongside her on the newspaper cover, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the alleged Chequers plan for the Brexit, claiming that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect the other's tariffs was "totally absurd."
Wayde’s murder: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspected of LSU player’s death
Police arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and imprisoned for a second-grade murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police point out that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, WAFB, CBS subsidiary reports.
After interrogating Simpson, police say they admitted to shooting Wayde.
A $350,000 deposit has been established, according to the defence.
The Baton Rouge District Instruction Court This published a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death had been a bullet wound on the neck that had reached the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and citizens for their assistance in investigation that led to arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU’s sports director, thanked the police forces in the area for their “diligence and search for justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was more than two meters, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had won an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a match of the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade stated that his team is "devastated" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.
“These are the things people always care about,” Wade said.
Volcano ashes in Mexico City
Ceniza from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighborhoods south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday that they should stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center recorded several tremors and shakes.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ashes by covering the windshields of vehicles in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independentist protesters faced anti-disorders while thousands of people participated in opposite demonstrations coinciding with the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarized referendum on the secession.
A group of separatists hooded to whom anti-disorders had cut the step threw eggs and dust painting, creating dark dust clouds on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Conflicts also occurred in later hours and the police used fools to contain the fight.
For several hours, the independentist groups, with messages such as “no forget or forgiveness,” faced unionist protesters with the screaming of “Live Spain”.
Fourteen people were treated by mild injuries suffered during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region a year after the October 1 vote, considered illegal by Madrid, but held by separatist Catalans.
Voters elected independence by crushing majority, although the participation was low, as the persons who were against the secession largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police’s attempt to stop voting at electoral tables across the region, where violent clashes occurred.
The independence groups camped Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support for the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
68-year-old Narcis Termes, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia will be independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although close, in the regional elections of last December, the Procathalanist parties have struggled to retain the impulse this year, as many of their best-known leaders, whether in self-tax exile or detained, are waiting for judgment for their role in the organization of the referendum and subsequent independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protest in support of police on his phone, said the conflict had been revived by politicians from both sides.
"It's getting increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in preventive imprisonment since late last year, announced that he would participate in next year’s European Parliament elections.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regresion in the democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.

At some point, you may have shot in the car with a ballet.
Menga Attack Awards 1-0 Victory to Livingston against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers by achieving the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's attack marked the difference, Gary Holt's ones climbed up a position, with the Hibernian in second position.
This season, Gerrard’s have not yet achieved any home wins and next Sunday they face the Hearts, board leaders with eight points of advantage.
The Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the European League.
Meanwhile, Livingston expands its rack of victories in the division to six matches. Holt, head coach, has not yet tasted the defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston leaves opportunities in front of a stunning visitor
Holt's team had to have gone a step ahead long before scoring, causing all kinds of problems to the Rangers for their direct game.
Scott Robinson surpassed the defense, but failed his attempt in front of the port, and then Alan Lithgow was shot off after entering him to break Craig Halkett's head center in front of the port.
The host team was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble to visitors with the stopped ball plays.
That’s how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston sought an entrance, with a combined game of Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, which hit the ball and marked from the center of the area.
At that time, the Rangers dominated possession, but they could not pass the host's defense and the gate guard, Liam Kelly, was quite quiet.
That game continued until the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stop.
Allan McGregor, the Rangers gate guard, rejected Scott Pittman's shot from a kick, and Lithgow stayed away from another Livingston play.
In the area of Livingston, they were constantly entering long passes, but they were always cleaned. Two criminal requests were rejected, one after Halkett's entry on substitute Glenn Middleton and another by one hand.
"Fenomenal" of Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for the Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to exceed the expectations of an ascending path.
His game style and template have barely experienced changes since his rise, but this is largely due to Holt by the way he has reinforced the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Halkett, the team captain, was huge and led a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good moments with Gerrard, they remained short.
They failed to materialize the games, as they only managed to enter the opposite field once, which is a call of attention to the Rangers, which are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during breakfast from Turkey and Germany leaders in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of restoring NATO’s allies’ relationships.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Then, Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city welcomes the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police alleged safety reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters faced themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents, many of them Kurdish, were also heard to condemn both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to receive it in the country.
These demonstrations reflect how divisive this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocratic by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after collision with a vehicle
A cyclist died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the crossing of Bestwookod Street and Evelyn Street, a running road from Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15.
The driver stopped and the cyclist was served by paramedics, but died there.
The accident occurs after another cyclist died after being trapped by a vehicle that left on Childers Street, nearly two miles from the Saturday accident place.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents were working to identify the man and inform his family members.
Roads have been cut and buses have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Agents Injured After Disturbance
Six prison officials have been injured in a dispute produced in a high-security prison for men, according to the Office of the prison center.
The disturbances began in Long Lartin prison, Worcestershire, around Sunday 9:30 and still continue.
Specialists from an elite team (called "Tornado") are taking care of controlling the disputes, in which eight internals participate and affect a pavilion.
The agents received assistance for mild injuries in the face in the place.
A spokesman for the prison office comments: “Specialized prison personnel have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident of Long Lartin prison.
Six staff have received health care for injuries.
Violence is not tolerated in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be put in the hands of the police and could spend more time between reels."
The Long Lartin prison hosts more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the director of the prison had received hospital medical assistance after a prisoner attacked him.
Furthermore, in October last year, anti-disorder agents were requested to go to prison to address a serious dispute in which prison personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
The Rosa hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (dried areas could benefit)
It’s uncommon for tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week when the last collections of the Rosa hurricane cross southwest of the desert, at risk of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued sudden flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada and southeast California and Utah, including cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to direct directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain at the end of Monday.
The Phoenix National Meteorology Service commented on a tweet that only "ten hurricanes had preserved their state of tropical storm or depression at a range of 321 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached almost 65 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rains, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of Escarpe Mogollón, Arizona.
It is likely to fall between 2 and 5 inches of rain, with the possibility of reaching the 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the southwest desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Base.
In places that are not at risk of sudden floods, Rose rains can be considered a blessing as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, part of these torrential rains is likely to be beneficial due to the drought conditions currently experienced in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported at weather.com.
First, the Rosa hurricane itinerary will hit the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning will still have a hurricane force with a maximum speed of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north to 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is getting cold waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to fall back in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm throughout Monday afternoon.
Heavy torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at a considerable risk of flood.
“Torrential rains are expected between 7 and 15 inches from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 inches,” weather.com communicates.
Then, Rosa will head towards northern desi Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, later moving through Arizona towards southern Utah at last hour of Tuesday night.
“The main danger of Rosa or its remains is the strong torrent rain in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the southwest of the U.S. desert,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous sudden floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as land slides in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for murder attempt
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspected of a murder attempt after another 16-year-old with white weapon wounds in Somerset had been found.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton, at 4:00 p.m. on Saturday.
He was moved to a hospital where he remains "stable."
A 17-year-old, two of 18 and one of 20 were arrested that same night in the Radstock area in Avon, according to Somerset Police.
The agents have made a call to anyone who might have recorded what happened with the mobile.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered mixture and anger" of the Democratic Party
"Voting in favour of Judge Kavanaugh is to reject the merciless and indignating tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a statement held in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered the mixture and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the entire appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, deniing the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that she had been sexually assaulted decades ago when she was teenagers.
Ford also testifyed at the meeting about this accusation.
On Saturday, the president said that, that day, the “Americans saw Kavanaugh’s stubbornness, quality and courage.”
"Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most accomplished legalists today, a lawyer with an admirable history to the public service," he told West Virginia followers.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh’s nomination by talking about the importance of Republican participation in elections mid-term.
“They’re lacking five weeks for one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don’t present myself, but it’s a race,” he said.
"That's why I'm going from one place to another fighting to get big candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are embarked on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first key prosecutional vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to be held no later on Friday, a senior official of the Republican Party’s leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number is increasing
At least 384 people have died and many have been dragged by the huge waves destroying the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as authorities reported Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of Palu City on Friday when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at night, dragging many to death and destroying it all at its step.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“When yesterday it was warned that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and didn’t escape immediately, so they were victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Catastrophe Management Agency (BNPB) of Indonesia, at a press conference in Yakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, dragged cars, trunks, houses, destroyed everything on earth,” Nugroho said. The tsunami had moved through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had gone up to the trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The air photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to beat the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) reported in a statement that the energy released by the big earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “important” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the debris of the destroyed buildings, and 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the number of victims and damages could be greater along the 300 km coast north of Palu, a zone called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"The communications were completely paralyzed and there was no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“There live more than 300,000 people,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy of itself, but it could be much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received many criticisms for not reporting that a tsunami had beaten Palu, although officials say the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by a fan and shared on social media, a man who was on the top floor of a building was heard warning people on the street that a tsunami approached.
In a few minutes, a water wall hits the coast, taking ahead of buildings and cars.
Reuters could not validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a huge breakdown that cut off communications in the surrounding Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but evacuated people still need food and other commodity.
The city airport has reopened only for help tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul’s evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims is more than 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although Donggala’s World Vision staff have come healthy and safe to the city of Palu, where employees are refugeing under lones installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating landscape on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
"I was told that they had seen a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even while the aid groups launched the gears of disaster assistance, some people regretted that it was not allowed to move to Palu of widely experienced cooperators.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and foreign staff can only be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial catastrophe," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
As soon as the government says it considers it a national disaster, we can start providing international assistance, but it has not yet happened.
When the second night fall in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, friends and family members of people who were still missing still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that bring some light to the devastating stories written by natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little child was taken out of a shelter.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the debris for two days alongside her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, an instructor of the national paragliding team of Indonesia, had formed two of the paragliders missing for the Asian Games, who concluded earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped at the Roa Roa hotel, Mr. Mangagi included, were his students.
“For my experience in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the disclosure of the news that Roa Roa Hotel had fallen down in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the Palu competitors, who participated in the festival held on the beach.
However, his messages showed only a grey check mark, not two in blue.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves are worn $26,750 during a recharge of an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves tracked a Brink employee who recharged an ATM in Newport on the Levee, carrying $26,750, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The vehicle driver had emptied an ATM in the centre of leisure and prepared to recharge it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote on the note.
As he was busy, another man "running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money intended for recharge.
According to the note, there are witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the site, but police did not specify the number of involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities must contact Newport Police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will start calling himself Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person previously known as Kanye West."
For a time ago West, 41, is called Ye, a name he used as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present its new album, Yandhi.
It replaces singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance by "emotional reasons," as the program's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word was religious to him.
“I think it’s the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year as he talked about the title of the album with the radio speaker Big Boy.
“I’m you, it’s us, it’s us.
It passed from being Kanye, which means ‘the only’, Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
It is one of the many famous rappers who has changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in majors or tiny, with or without a script.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against civilians
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, elected Mexican president, has promised not ever use the army against the civilian population, now as it approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students in the country.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised at Plaza Tlatelolco that he would never use the army to suppress the village of Mexico.
On October 2, 1968, the troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when the left student movements were strengthening throughout Latin America.
López Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican young people by giving monthly grants to whom they study and opening more free public universities.
He claimed that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to integrate into criminal bands.
U.S. should double the financing of I.A.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, investor and professional of I.A. who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments later emerge the announcements relating to the I.A. from several parts of the U.S. government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacks an I.A. official strategy.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year: its goal is to become number 1 in innovation in I A. by 2030.
“Duplicating I.A.’s research budget would be a good start, since all the other countries go far behind the U.S. We have a look at the next advance in the I.A field,” Lee said.
Twice the financing means twice the chance that the next big achievement in I.A. will be reached in the U.S., as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by editorial Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most important I.A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked in an I.A. system that won the best American player in Othello, then he was executive at Microsoft Research and chairman of Google’s subsidiary in China.
Lee gave recognition to the previous U.S. government’s technological competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be the next one, which would allow to identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to strive a lot to obtain government grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s leading academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired high-end universities to work at I.A.
Lee commented that changes in migration policy could also help the United States intensify their I.A initiatives.
"I think doctors in I.A. should automatically have permanent residence cards," he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China funds people from academic institutions as well as the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations fund U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, whose aim is to attract partners in the industrial and academic fields, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in I.A. research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that tried to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not carried out any action in months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum about whether they will change their country’s name
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday about whether their name is going to change to “North Macedonia Republic,” a gesture that would solve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked their candidate for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor’s name is a claim from its territory and has vetered its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has questioned whether the stake will reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The referendum asked the following question: “Are you in favour of NATO and the EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries arising from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to access bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for the country’s future, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the European Union, because this is a safer life for everyone,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopie.
Although it is not legally binding, many members of Parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote for it to be decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no irregularities had been reported at one afternoon.
However, the participation was only 16%, compared to 34% of the last elections to Parliament held in 2016, when 66% of registered voters deposited their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gyose Tanevski, who voted in the capital, Skopie.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted to the Macedonian referendum on a country name change that would open the ways to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopie, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and removed chairs in front of the tent planted by those who were to boycott the referendum.
"We're in favour of entering NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with the very high head, not by the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relationships with other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Euro-Asia’s integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would contribute to the investment it needs so much Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20%.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after depositing his vote.
He said a positive outcome would be a “confirmation of our future.”
In a survey published last Monday by the Policy Research Institute, it was assured that between 30 and 43% of voters were going to participate in the referendum, which represents a lower participation on the requested one.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV from Macedonia revealed that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be 50% plus a vote.
In case it fails, it would be the first serious coup to the pro-Western government policy since it came to power in May last year.
Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, avoids the entire defense of Brighton to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling overturned Brighton’s defense in the 2-0 victory that Manchester City won on Saturday at the Manchester Etihad Stadium.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal at the 65th minute.
The Argentine mediapunta received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the game.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before entering the open field.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green shirts.
He escaped a defense before overcoming several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English frontman used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit him with the right foot to avoid the porter Mathew Ryan with a shot that came to the right side of the network.
“Agüero has some problems in the foot,” said Pep Guardiola, City coach, to journalists.
“We talked about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to score a goal at that time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal arrived at the 29th minute.
In that game, Agüero received the ball very within the territory of Brighton.
He made a beautiful ball pass to the left flank for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him a few touchs before heading Sterling towards the second stick.
The Sky blues fronter launched the ball to the network just before leaving the boundaries.
The City faces the Hoffenheim in a group match of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena of Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to swallow the Rockies party
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoff war, there was no reason to force another opening.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to step the mountain on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if these, they triumphed with Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division of the National League, still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard position thanks to the 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still pursue their first division title.
“Even though we’re not playing anything, we can at least step the rubber with the certainty that the Denver audience will be excited and that the other team would probably play at the highest level that I’ve faced this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals still have to announce an opener for Sunday, but it seems like they are inclined to let Scherzer launch in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his opening number 34, held a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
Washington’s history is 18 victories and 7 defeats, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 tickets.
Trump takes a little bitch in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, talking about the importance of Republican participation in elections mid-term.
“In November, everything we have done is at stake.
There are five weeks for one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the most important. I don't present myself, but it's a career, so I'm going from one place to another fighting to get big candidates," he said.
And he continued: "We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it's going on right now.
And they are determined to recover power by all the necessary means, we see mixture, evil.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to go over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give it.”
The Democrats, he said, are embarked on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“We have seen it in the last four days,” he said, saying that the Democrats were “furious, evil, horrible, and false.”
He referred to the Senate Judicial Commission by appointing the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received the public's abuses.
“Do you remember your answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no, I hope a response. His body language was terrible, the worst I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party already covers a wide range of opinions.
It’s intolerant to people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I barely surprised.
After all, I am the last of a row of members of Parliament of the Labour Party to whom they are told that I am not welcome, and only to say what we think.
My Parliament colleague, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment to be categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for failing to agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy on national security over Europe. It is ironic that it was matters in which Jeremy was disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday, “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years in which I have been a member of the Parliament of the local Labour Party, that’s exactly what have been the night meetings of the General Committee on Fridays.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and kind" policy is already more than forgotten, if it really applied at some point.
It is increasingly clear that discrepant opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged based on whether the leaders of the party consider it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision began to hope that he would radically change his mind and adopt positions with which he would never have been agreed, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a diaphragm of insults on social media demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who has experienced it.
Indeed, I know I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, since comments about me tend to be politicians.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day, but never flee.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with each “censory” motion or every change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrow.
In the last two years, I have received many advice that recommended me to keep my head down and not to make me hear so much and so "it would be fine."
But I didn’t get into politics to do that.
Since 32 years ago I joined the Labour Party as a high school student, motivated by the negligence of Thatcher’s government who left the classroom of my whole school literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, whether as a councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my political ideas, either in the last elections.
It is impossible for someone in Nottingham East to unknow my political positions or the areas in which I was not in agreement with current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted Friday’s motion is that I don’t understand these desire to waste time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader when the country goes head to a Brexit that will affect homes, companies and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the voters, whether the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will prevent me from acting as I think it is best for you all.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an unbeaten Ayr climbs to the top
Two essays at the end of the match may have decided to some extent the final outcome, but, undoubtedly, Ayr deserved the victory in this very entertaining match of Tennent's Premiership day.
Now they head the table and is the only unbeaten team of the ten who participate.
In the end, he was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to better take advantage of the opportunities, which gave the victory to the local team, so coach Peter Murchie had all the right to be happy.
“They have tried us in all the parties and continue to be unbeaten, so I have to rejoice,” he said.
Robyn Christie, of the Melrose, commented: “The Ayr deserves recognition, they took advantage of the opportunities better than us.”
Grant Anderson’s essay at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, set the Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loan from the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opponent and Jason Baggot achieved an unconverted essay.
Climate expanded the advantage of the Ayr with a penalty. Before, just in the middle of the time, he marked and turned a single essay, leaving the marker in 17-5 in favor of the Ayr in the rest.
However, Melrose began well the second part and Patrick Anderson’s essay, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which they had to get out of bed, and, when the match was resumed, the Ayr went forward with a Stafford McDowall essay converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, Captain of the Ayr, allowed Melrose to take advantage of another man with an unconverted Bruce Colvine essay at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for scoring Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson made an essay when he was on the back of the maul that was going forward.
Climo converted it, just as he had done almost since the match was resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong from a hit and sent to Gregor Henry to the bottom to do the fifth essay of the locals.
The protagonist of Still Game wants to guide his career towards the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, the protagonist of Still Game, appears to be determined to move to the restoration sector after revealing that he has been named director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC program, who writes and co-protagonizes with his long-year-old comedy mate, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the matter, although a source of the Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan wanted to be involved in Glasgow’s “flowering restoration market”.
"The sea belongs to us": a coastless Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors guard a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings they wave blue sea flags.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right,
Recovery is a duty.”
In all of Bolivia, a sealess land, they still lively remember the lost coast of Chile in a bloody conflict for the resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the desire to re-sail the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the biggest in decades, as Bolivia expects a resolution by the International Court of Justice for the first October, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens spread across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will pronounce in favor of the Bolivia claim that after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has the obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who plays a controversial battle for reelection next year, also has a lot to say about the resolution of Monday.
"We're very close to return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s decision arrives only six months after the final allegations indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, Chilean expert in international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, it may have been overwhelmed for the last four years.
“The problem of access to the sea has been kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
Moreover, he suggested that Morales’ belligerant rhetoric has mined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to keep talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and the possibility of “ending 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, which is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would use the maritime theme as a political muleet.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“Resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to end nuclear disarmament if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit held in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments arrive at the time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume diplomatic talks on paralyzed nuclear matters more than three months after this summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that continued sanctions and US opposition to a statement that ends the Korean War to submit to the north is a "chemera".
Washington is anxious to accept the statement without Pyongyang making any significant disarmament movement before.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to celebrate another summit.
However, a widespread skepticism over Pyongyang’s seriousness of renouncement of an arsenal that the country probably considers as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another summit among the presidents.
The Paris fashion parades reveal the latest line of huge hats that are about to land in a street of stores near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or fully protect yourself from the sun, don’t look for any more.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented a set of large-sized eccentric hats for their 2019 spring summer collection on the gateway, stunning the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the gateway.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide-wing adorned with feathers that enveloped the heads of the models.
Other large-sized supplements were sandwiches with jewelry, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strawberries masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and remembered Hannibal Lecter more than the high seam.
One creation reminded a complete diving team, snorkeling and glasses included, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like big-sized fashion, you're lucky.
Style hunters predict that huge hats could begin to see in the streets of shops.
The big hats come by stepping strongly by hand from "La Bomba", with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 inches used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this so unpractical hat that social media flooded presented another great creation on the gateway: a straw beach bag as large as the bathing model that carried it.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fleets and with a white leather handle, was the main piece of the Jacquemus Riviera collection for the spring-summer season 2019 in the Paris Fashion Week.
As Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “Next summer, I hope to see huge beach hats and beach bags on the shopping streets. Since the designer has had a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized add-ons.”
John Edward: Linguistic competencies are fundamental for citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent educational centres have a path of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results in exams that are reinforced by individual and collective successes harvested in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these centers, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges (SCIS) are trying to deliver the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is observed that modern languages remain a popular and desired subject in centers.
As Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, it comes to his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that, if you want to establish relationships and generate confidence with people from other countries, you cannot depend only on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the classification tables, with the highest approved rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest score.
The data, collected from the 74 centers that were part of the SCIS, showed that 72 per cent of students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also obtained an A.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages by considering them a fundamental competence that both children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Currently, languages are considered to be at the same level as CTIM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the study plans of independent schools and everywhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK Employment and Competence Commission revealed that 17 per cent were attributed to the lack of linguistic competences from the reasons that entrepreneurs gave about their difficulties in covering jobs.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable to prepare young people for their future careers.
Possible job opportunities that require languages are increasing, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last your lifetime.
The fact of being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to automatically advance competition.
According to a poll conducted by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and it was established that the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for children today.
If you know several languages, especially those in developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centers will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach the most important languages for the UK from 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child are, in independent schools you can always choose from several languages taught by teaching staff specialized in this field.
Scotland’s independent educational centres devote all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and that teams with the skills needed to succeed, whatever it takes them for the future.
At present, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital importance for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered "competences for international communication."
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We need to do it.

LeBron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James debut in his first game with Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Luke Walton, the Lakers coach, has announced that James will play the preseason opening match to be held Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it still remains to be determined how many minutes you are going to play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell published in a tweet that James was likely to play a few limited minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked for his plans for the Lakers’ six-game pre-season program.
“At this stage of my career I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Time of Trump's Mist in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump launches a series of campaign myths tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is the first of Trump’s five scheduled myths for the next week, including stops in places with supporters such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote of his candidate to cover the vacancy of the Supreme Court in waiting, Trump intends to obtain support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing Congress control when votes are deposited in November.
What time is Trump’s mitin in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump’s mitin in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch online through a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on the appearances of this week of the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who were tensed because of the accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior and have left waiting for an early Senate confirmation vote for, like a lot, a week while the FBI investigates them.
However, the main goal of this series of myths is to help Republicans who face the November elections take boost.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign noted that the five next week’s myths are intended to “encourage volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they retain in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters said.
“Congress control is so crucial for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as long as we enter campaign,” a Trump spokesman told Reuters.
Programmed at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena Stadium, this night’s mitin could attract Ohio and Pennsylvania sympathizers as well as have coverage in the Pittsburgh media, as reported by West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won for more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is restraining in the surveys.
"For Morrisey, it's not a good sign that the president has to come to him to push him on the surveys," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team proves that it dares to struggle to keep the hope for Sunday’s individual matches alive.
After three individual sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursomes may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The impulse oscillating pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but players truly believe in it, even more in competitions like these.
So where would they say the impulse is now?
“We had six points of advantage and now we carry four, so I guess that this can be considered a small boost,” said Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, advantage: four points ahead with twelve more in play.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel they have some wind in favor and motives to be excited, among other reasons for the couple formed by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and achieved three points of four each.
Spieth has been deadly from the tee to green and preaching with the example.
The gutural crys of celebration rose volume as his round moved forward, introducing a vital putt to empath the fourth game when he and Thomas went down two holes after two holes.
The putt that gave them the match in the 15 was received with a similar scream, from those who broadcast who believe the U.S. team has not yet left out.
"What to make efforts reinforce and focus on the game," Spieth said.
That’s what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a footprint.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple of Europe takes four out of four and nothing can get them wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes of Friday morning.
That rash and the way their energy flows with the bustling public make clear that these are the players to beat Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun goes down in Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
Still, it remains premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson sent Sergio García, the hero of the four balls of the morning, after making a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole they didn’t get out of.
But on Sunday there will be no kind of help to get out of the holes.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to see them closely because they appreciate the interactions between couples, the advice they give and those they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a great advantage in front of the last day, but this foursome session also showed that the U.S. team dares to fight, something some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe goes ahead by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe leaves a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 outcome over the United States.
The motivated duo composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the competition with two victories over a Tiger Woods that was seen in trouble, getting four points forward in the Le Golf National classification.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning fourballs, which ended up 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but failed to shorten distances.
American Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from Sunday’s 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newbie to win four consecutive points, and he and Molinari, who received the nickname of "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent union served to defeat a disappointed Woods and the American newborn Bryson Decahmbeau for a 5-4 round.
Woods, which in the two Saturday matches hadn't highlighted too much, had occasional moments of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes matches, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, again became Henrik Stenson's couple in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, world number one and world number three, respectively, with a 2-1 result.
Although the day was nice and quiet in the southwest of Paris, Europe did not have everything on its own.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference to the Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They won an exciting 2-1 win against Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the two initial holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point difference in the individual matches has only happened two times, although Furyk, as the trophy owner, needs only one pattern to preserve it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems to be a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their possibilities.
North Korea says “there is no possibility” to disarm first unilaterally if they don’t have confidence
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations that the continuation of the sanctions deepened its mistrust in the United States and that there was no possibility for his country to unilaterally resign to nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho declared to the annual General Assembly of the international agency that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" over the past year, such as stoping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities and commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we don’t receive any similar answer from the United States,” he said.
"If we don't have confidence in the United States, we can't have confidence in our national security, and in those circumstances there's no possibility that we will first disarm ourselves unilaterally."
Although Ri repeated North Korea’s well-known complaints for Washington’s resistance to a “stage-by-phase” denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes gradual steps, his statement is important, as he has no longer rejected a unilateral denuclearization, such as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump following the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to work for the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must resign before its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted appeals to smooth international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States has insisted on denuclearization first and have increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, even by making objections to a statement of ending the war," Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can cause us to fall on our knees is a chimera of the people who don’t know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri made no mention of the plans of a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced by the U.S. leader at the United Nations in the early week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings held between South Korea’s leader Kim and Moon Jae in the last five months, adding: “If South Korea had been the interested party in denuclearization instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be found in a similar stagnation.”
Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korea’s missiles to U.S. soil after the “malignant president” Trump on suicidal mission called Kim “man rocket.”
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "destroy entirely" North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery in progress towards disarmament, but said he remained a lot to be done and it was necessary to continue to apply sanctions until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline set for this: "We can take two years, three years, or five months, no matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The imposing of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue vigorously and without breach until we make the definitive and fully verified denuclearization reality.”
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang’s ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo talked with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had occurred, but, a few hours later, North Korea denounced that his "requirements were the requirements of a mafious."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile location and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the "corresponding measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relationships with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
Thanks to a new course taught this year at Harvard University, all college students sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing machist culture of studying drinking caffeine all night.
A teacher discovered that students at the world’s number one university often have no idea of the basic care of oneself.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine, and a Brigham and Women's Hospital specialist designed the course, is believed to be the first of his class in the U.S.
His motivation to start the course emerged after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl approached me and asked me why she just heard of this now, in her last year.
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he said.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of university health services, noted that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students barely slept during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on sports performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of infarction, embolia, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know you won’t change students’ behavior instantly.
However, we believe they have the right to know it, just like anyone has the right to know the effects on tobacco smoking on the health,” Professor Czeisler added.
He claimed that the culture of pride for "passing the night on sail" still exists and added that modern technology and increased pressure to which students were subjected meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping enough time and a good quality sleep should be "the secret weapon" of students to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety; even to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation causes the brain to generate a feeling of hunger, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He pointed out that the course had opened her eyes and inspired to expand it to the entire campus.
It hopes that the next step is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler’s recommendation is that students think of putting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” that emit the screens of electrical apparatus and LEDs, which can alter circadian rhythms, so they would end up having trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal to bury the men of Gerrard
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression outside the house, when Dolly Menga's attack destroyed Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team at a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox people wanted to get their first home-out victory from the 4-1th of February in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 matches as a coach, leaving their team at eight points from the Hearts, destroyed leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga’s attack felt minutes before half-time and the Rangers’ uninspired alignment was not at any time.
Now, the Rangers go down to the sixth position, the Livingston goes up to the third, behind the Hibernian for the goal difference.
The Rangers may find more trouble, as line judge Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance for a wound in his head after, supposedly, someone threw an object from the visiting background.
Gerrard changed to eight of the titles who won the match against the Ayr, entering the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
Holt pushed out the 11 Livingston players who started a point at the Hearts last week and would have rejoiced the way his organized team drowned the opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston better took advantage of the ball when he had it.
They should have scored the two minutes of the beginning, when Menga went into space for Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs took a deep mistake for Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only send her out on the long stick.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed like there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been punished at the 15th minute of match, when he and Steven Lawless collapsed, but arbitrator Steven Thomson made deaf ears to the Colombian’s request.
The Rangers achieved two shots in the first half, but Ibrox’s former gate guard, Liam Kelly, was barely in difficulty dealing with Lassana Coulibaly’s head and the boring launch of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the goal marked in the 34th minute by the Livingston came against any forecast, no one can deny that they deserved it for dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to face a deep Jacobs stopped ball play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fitted the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and gave it to Menga to mark the goal.
In the rest, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, as the wheel passed it to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly left his line to block it.
Still, the Livingston continued to take visitors exactly to the type of game he liked, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing one long pass after another.
The Holt people could have gained more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor remained firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow removed a corner of head that did not enter.
The substitute for the Rangers, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty towards the end of the match after a meeting with Jacobs, but again, Thomson looked to another side.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now, a page of the "Sunday Morning" section Almanac: 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago, and CONTAN... was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that culminated with the device known as Geiger Counter.
The Geiger Counter, who has since been a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Beads of Coronado", with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the apparently incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
By putting your headphones, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 when he was about to age 63.
But the invention carrying its name remains alive.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and kill malignant cells.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the removal of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can "see" a protein common to many cancers and reinject them.
A vaccine trial is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw how her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method requires the removal of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of different types of cancer", such as breast, ovary, lung or colorectal cancer, Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "teaching them" to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a diaphragm in favour of Trump with a MAGA cap after his appearance in SNL.
It didn't work well.
Kanye West was pushed out in the Saturday Night Live study after an erratic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he would be presented to the elections in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he used the cap with the Make America Great Again message, he began to depotricate against the Democrats and regain his support for Trump.
“Many times I speak to someone white and wonder how I can like Trump if he’s racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began Matt Damon’s sketch show in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Judicial Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn’t broadcast, the comic Chris Rock raised the recording of West’s broke to social media.
It’s not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
Furthermore, West told the public that it had happened badly between the frames for carrying that cap.
“They met with me.
They told me not to go out with the bucket.
They came up with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how sleeping I am?" and added, "I was going to put his superman coat, because that meant that no one could tell him what he had to do.
Try with love.”
Her feedback was given from the audience at least two occasions and SNL members seemed to be embarrassed, Variety reported. One person told the magazine: "The study was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former spouse, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West discouraged many when he went to the stage to sing I Love it dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “One of the most brave spirits: Thank you for resisting the multitude.”
Karen Hunter, an host of an interview program, tweeted that West was simply "being himself and that's absolutely wonderful."
“But I decide NOT to reward someone (buying his music or clothes, or supporting his art) who I think is embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
We also," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that his name had been changed, saying he was now “the person previously known as Kanye West.”
He’s not the first artist to change his name, following Diddy’s steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also named himself Snoop Lion, without forgetting the missing legend of music, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.
Murder attempt charge in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been accused of a murder attempt after a man was stuck at a eastern restaurant in Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The accused is expected to appear at the Belfast First Instance Court on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Kit Harington, Star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO, Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the male hero’s stereotype, saying that those screen papers often transmitted to young boys who had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview awarded to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believed “something has gone wrong” and was questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old throne player, Rose Leslie, admitted that he seems "really important" to address this issue.
“Personally, it seems quite important to me right now, where have we been wrong with masculinity?” he said.
"What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they are seen now?"
Kit believes that television may be part of the responsibility for growing toxic masculinity due to its such male characters.
And he continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, which makes young people feel that they have to be this concrete form of man?
I think that's one of the great questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it’s clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequel or sequel of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying it is "hard of battlefields and horses."
As of November, Kit will star True West, Sam Shepard’s theatre that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he has taken from the Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in the series, so in that sense he has given me my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit’s character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic Emmy award-winning series.
The couple married in June 2018 at a Leslie family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more of new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health authorities.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually infected, which is a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of HIV-contractors in this way has been decreased in virtually their entirety, Chinese health authorities declared at a conference held in Yunnan province.
Each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases around 100,000 people.
Sexually transmitting HIV is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but the LGTB group suffers a lot of discrimination.
Due to the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are not to use adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of his staff leaves data from Republican Party senators and argues that it's "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Representative Maxine Waters criticized on Saturday the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal data from three American Republican Party senators on Wikipedia pages on lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these accusations were driven by commentators and “right extreme” websites.
"Lies, lies, and more vicious lies," Waters said in a Twitter post.
Supposedly, the published information included the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown Capitol published the information on the Internet during a session of the Senate panel on allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior against Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate.
The filtration was carried out at some point after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters office and made public data from a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
“This unfunded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was in no way the responsible for the deletion of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement raised immediate criticism on the Internet, including those of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"Reject this information with angry," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests not the template necessary to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he didn’t do, he shouldn’t get angry.
You shouldn't rebell.
They should not question the reasons of the accuser.
It must keep calm and serenity.”
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare Waters' reaction with Democrats' criticism to Judge Kavanaugh, whom the detractors accused of seeming too angry during the appearance on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to disbank Waters in mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had warned “the relevant authorities and entities responsible for compliance with the law of these fraudulent allegations.”
“We will make sure that the authors are discovered,” he continued, “and that they are considered legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my staff.”
Johnny English: Again in action. Rowan Atkinson's spy parody remains short
Now it has become a tradition to look for Brexit chickens in any new movie with a British approach. It seems that this is what corresponds to doing with this new delivery of the Johnny English parodic franchise of action and comedy, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Is this ironic self-satistry about how clearly foolish we are the new nation's export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his leap eyes and his inexpressive face, has renewed his license to put his foot for the second time. Only his name already gives hints that, more than nothing, it is a comic creation designed for non-English speaking cinema territories.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange claims to overthrow glamur, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pitch of that kind that touched a single note on the theme of Fire Cars that took place at the inauguration ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
In addition, it was based on the mysterious traveller and international man represented by Atkinson years ago in Barclaycard’s already forgotten television ads, sowing the chaos behind him.
In this last delivery, there are one or two good moments.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor while the helicopters hit the helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy jumps in sight, but the mood remains quite short and is strangely superfluous, especially now that franchises of “serious” movies like 007 and Mission impossible add comic ingredients without problems.
Humor seems more aimed at children than adults and, to me, the absurd disappointments of Johnny English are not as ingenious and accurate as Atkinson’s silent jokes in Mr. Bean’s role.
Now, the repeated current argument is that Britain is in serious problems.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the Britain’s supersecret spy network, revealing the identities of all his agents active in the consternation of the agent in service, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the drop that fills the glass for the prime minister, a pompous and accompanied character who’s watching how her political popularity sinks: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself in this character that’s almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn’t leave much margin to work.
His intelligence advisors tell you that, as all active spies are dangerous, you will have to resort to someone who is withdrawn.
That's got to be the crazy Johnny English, who now teaches at a high school, although he gives extraofficial lessons about how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it's a rock school-like spy academy.
English is moved to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets with his former suffering companche Bough, represented again by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a man married with a submarine captain, a nice paper for which Vicki Pepperdine is not taking advantage of enough.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in His Majesty’s Secret Service return to action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous claws of a charismatic multibillionaire in the technology world who claims it can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough initiate their odyssey of absurd situations: they are disguised as warmers, fired at an elegant French restaurant, unleashed the chaos hiding in the luxurious yacht of Volta; in addition, English becomes pure anarchy when trying to use a helmet of virtual reality to familiarize with the interior of the Volta house.
Definitely, they were deeply employed in that last sequence, but, however very funny and stressful, the whole continues to transmit a little childhood feeling.
A quite regular product.
Like the other Johnny English movies, I couldn’t avoid wondering if the British film industry couldn’t give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes genuine justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is making a plan for the British to work four days a week, but cover five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is going to think about a radical plan with which the British would work four days a week, but they would charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants companies to destiny the savings obtained through the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers, giving them an additional free day.
So, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea “will fit” in the party’s plans and economic agenda to incline the country in favour of workers.
This change to a four-day week has received support from the Congress of Unions, as it is a way for workers to take part of the changing economy.
Like a senior office of the Labour Party commented to The Sunday Times: It is expected to announce a revision of the directive before the year ends.
“It will not be achieved from one day to another, but the four-day working week is definitely a matter that the party expects to incorporate to rebalance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this type of ideas, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general elections.
However, not all of the Labour Party supports this decision.
A spokesman for the Labors said, “The four-day working week is not part of the party’s policy and is not going to be discussed right now.”
The Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference that was held last week to expose his idea of carrying out a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to recover powers from "anonymous directors" and "advantaged" in charge of companies providing public services.
The minister’s plans in the shadow also include the idea that current shareholders of water companies do not recover all their participation, as a Labour government could apply deductions corresponding to perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers in business boards and create inclusive ownership funds in which 10% of private sector companies’ shares should be allocated to employees, which would amount to annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak in “60 Minutes” about FBI’s investigation about Kavanaugh and whether they could make them change their minds
The FBI’s investigation on the allegations made against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed at least a week the final vote for confirmation as the Supreme Court Magistrate and also raises the question of whether the results that were concluded could influence some Republican senator who finally decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will be issued on Sunday, "60 Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham talk about whether the FBI could draw information to the light that made them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"I was in favour of proceeding with the hearing," I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, that the allegation came out and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He showed himself firm, resolved, tasteful.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems unmovable.
"I already have a decision taken about Brett Kavanaugh and would ignore the charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it deeply," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she named have been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It’s always the same, I don’t see anything new in this case.”
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Have you managed to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive star poster gathers for an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see how tens of thousands of people will move to the Central Park’s Great Lawn to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to aware of the actual goal of the event: to end with extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that expects to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If you want to receive a free entry for the event (unless you can pay a VIP entry), concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteers, send emails to a world leader, make a phone call, or anything else that serves to aware of their goal of ended poverty.
But what has the Global Citizen achieved 12 years of achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to take steps or is it just a form of so-called “clictivism”, which is called the posture we adopt when we think we’re doing something really useful when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters in favour of a large number of different goals.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have achieved global leaders to announce commitments and policies for more than $37 billion, which will impact more than 2250 billion people’s lives by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and advertisements that emerged from their shares, of which at least $1 billion have already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly influenced nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is “The Power of Nutrition”, a UK-based partnership of investors and executives combined with the common commitment to “to help children grow up and develop with their full potential.” For this purpose, they have been proposed to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end the country’s malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 Global Citizens tweets.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and collaborators of Global Citizens like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that, after taking more than 5000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the UK for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions asked on your website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
a Global Citizen collaborator replied, “It will be a long and tough path and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But, as previously achieved the movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performances we will count at this year’s New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy to carry out the blockade of energy exports from Russia - Secretariat of the Interior
"When necessary," Washington could resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking markets, including the Middle Eastern, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, published in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s alliance with Syria, especially where it operates on request of the legitimate government, is just an excuse for expansion in new markets.
“I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the most southern supplier in Europe,” he said.
Furthermore, according to official information, there are ways and methods to address this issue.
“The United States, with its Navy, has the ability to ensure that the seaways remain open and, where appropriate, could even block them to ensure that the energy doesn’t end in the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is defined as the “energie consumer voice” in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington keeps in his negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are in fact the same.
“The economic alternative in Iran and Russia consists basically of taking advantage of and replacing fuels,” he warned while indicating that Russia only knows to do one thing, which is basing its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims are carried out when the Trump administration has been trying to drive the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and relieve itself to Russia, which is the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To do so, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “improper” project of the Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into Moscow’s hostage.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that reaches a value of $11 billion and is intended to double the current capacity of the gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economical project.
The Kremlin defends that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project responds only to economic reasons and is a more unfair competence.
“I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. Energy Secretary, last September in Moscow.
The US posture has, however, been met with the rejection of Germany, who has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The industry-leading organization in Germany, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industries Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully analyze the possibility of presenting himself as a presidential candidate in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he will study the possibility of joining the presidential race after the elections mid-term.
During an appearance in the City Hall of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was raised.
"It's time for women to come to Washington to amend our fractured government and to finally have women among the leaders," the Hill said.
“After November 6, I’m going to seriously aim to present myself as a presidential candidate.”
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during an appearance in the City Hall and said he was “leading the country on the wrong path.”
"I really worry about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren spoke untrusted about Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren stated that “it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote.”
On Thursday, a survey was published in which, however, a majority of Warren's voters themselves don't believe it should be presented for the 2020 elections.
58% of Massachusetts’ “possible” voters said the senator should not be presented, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
32% of respondents supported, however, their application.
The survey showed greater support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent support for a possible candidate and 48 per cent against.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party talked about the possible candidate for 2020 by former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder in Donald Trump's miting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after listing in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"The situation that my son is passing through, for everything that has happened since he returned, knows the other families suffering from the effects derivative of PTSD and other wounds our soldiers return with," he told the audience who gathered in a mitin in favour of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo no one wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other war veterans who “return with a different behavior, hardened, wondering whether there really is that respect for what his co-soldiers and aviators, as well as all other members of the army, have given to their country.”
On Monday he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, accused of an episode of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under drugs or alcohol effects, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla police department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to achieve new asylum policy
18 states and the Columbia District support a judicial resort to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gangs.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district presented a "friendly" writing on Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker who faces the current directive, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant has not been revealed in the case "Grace v. Sessions" presented in August by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union (ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union) against federal policy.
She said her partner "and her children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys representing these states defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a lot of U.S. asylum applications, such as nations facing widespread domestic violence and gang problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision took by the Board of Migration Appeals (BIA) for which undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in this country.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine made statements on Friday in which he claimed that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
“According to federal legislation, all asylum applications must be failed under the particular facts and circumstances of the lawsuit and, instead, this exception violates that principle,” the amicus curiae stated.
The lawyers also stated in the writing that the policy that denies entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy by claiming that they often become entrepreneurs more often and "suppose a needed labour force."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and band violence in June.
"They can apply for asylum for people who leave their countries of origin for reasons of persecution or threats by race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said when he announced this directive on June 11.
Asylum was never created as a measure to tackle all the problems, not even all the serious problems, faced daily by people around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while increasing the number of dead in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly harmful.
“The situation is very tense,” Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told us while trying to comfort her baby with fever in a centre of evacuation from the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute ambulances come with more bodies.
And the clean water is scarce.”
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to research among the few neglected belongings that remain in an effort to recover whatever they can.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals, also damaged due to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, rested on the outside of the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to continuous replications, too very strong.
I couldn’t avoid crying when he reported to us the violent earthquake he lived while he was on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to get safe.
I was trapped in the remains of the ruined wall, I think,” Haris told Associated Press. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
“I heard my wife asking for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda announcements"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in a U.S. newspaper where the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China were promoted, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China Daily’s payment supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of wanting to be involved in the U.S. Congress elections on November 6, something China robustly denies.
The accusation he launched on Beijing’s attempt to influence the U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials indicated Reuters as a new phase in a growing Washington-initiated campaign to pressure China.
While it is usual foreign governments to publish ads to promote their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked in a growing trade war that has led them to increase tariff levels in both sides’ imports.
China’s compensatory tariffs that were applied at the beginning of the trade war were thought to count on state exporters like Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
As Branstad wrote in an opinion article at the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China “is further intensifying that pressure with advertising posts in our free press.”
“To try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the precious American tradition of freedom of expression and free press by trying to publish a payment announcement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, in the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few discrepant voices and no real reflection of the disparate views that people in China may have about the worrying path that is taking on their country’s economy as the media are controlled by the strong pressure of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most relevant newspapers declined the offer to publish" his article, although he didn't specify what newspaper it was.
Analysts say Republicans are getting away from women prior to voting half legislature with Kavanaugh’s debacle
Since many renowned Republicans are closing rows in favour of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh against the various accusations of sexual aggression, analysts have warned that a backdrop, especially by women, can occur in the upcoming votes to be held half the legislature.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and many Republicans have demonstrated they want to move forward with the vote.
"In such affairs it is not possible to go back," Grant Reeher, a professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, told The Hill in an article that was published Saturday.
Reeher doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)’s last attempt to position himself in favor of the FBI’s investigation is enough to calm voters disgusted with this matter.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow or in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to Washington’s newspaper.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators who gathered at the Senate's gates sounded "November is coming!" (November will arrive soon!) at the time when the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's candidate despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats comes out of every forecast,” Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
“People say the impact is already very relevant and, indeed, so.
But it could be even greater, especially among the undecisive women in the outside neighborhoods and the younger voters, between 18 and 29 years old, who don’t usually vote even though they don’t like the president.
Even before Ford’s public testimony in which he detailed his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts indicated that a backup could occur if the Republicans continued to confirm.
“This matter has become a big trouble for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's no longer just a matter of committee voting or final voting, not even if they're on Kavanaugh bank; it's also about how Republicans have handled all this and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA.
However, the Americans seem to be divided; they don’t know who they should believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, although a few more are the ones who put themselves on the part of the latter.
In a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents believe Ford’s testimony definitively or likely, while 35% claim to believe Kavanaugh definitively or likely.
In addition, 38% claimed that he thought, likely or definitively, Kavanaugh has lied during his testimony, while 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake’s push, the FBI is investigating Ford’s statements right now, as well as at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judicial Commission last week and indicated that Kavanaugh violated her being drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claimed that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed him his genitals at a party when he was studying in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that tries to rival with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest technology legend project, a company based on Berners-Lee’s Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked saying the intent that hides behind Inrupt is "to dominate the world."
“It has to be now,” he said about the startup.
"It's a historical moment."
The app uses Solid technology so that users can create their own "online personal data storage" or a POD.
It can contain lists, lists of pending tasks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
Something that is exclusive in personal online data storage is that the user is who fully decides who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal capacity through data."
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate resources, processes, and the skills necessary for Solid to reach everyone.
At the moment, the company is formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that bought IBM, some of the template-in-site developers who hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer developers.
As of this week, technological developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not a radical change is going to be introduced where all of his company models are completely modified from one day to another.
"We're not going to ask for permission."
In a publication on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that “his mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on network neutrality.
Despite even being launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the clergy who won a Victory Cross in World War I
The only clergy of the Church of England who won a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained this decoration on September 29, 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and never knew that he had been granted the greatest British military honor.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a commemorative stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "of a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that made him deserve decoration to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann guided his batallon through the Saint-Quentin Channel "through a thick fog and under the intense fire of machine makers and cannons".
Then he ran to the fire line and, with the "more courage," made the line advance before he reached a single-hand canyon and dropped three of the department.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann killed a German sniper on October 4, 1918, only a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said the actions he carried out his grandfather were “so big I’ll never be able to reach his height, but they were very accelerating.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a flower crown after the parade, which had the participation of the band Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was "a whole privilege for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is evident when he is shown such a large backup."
MMA followers were awake all night for the Bellator 206, but only watched Peppa Pig.
Imagine you stay awake all night to see the entire Bellator 206 so at the end you don’t let you see the main event.
The San Jose cartel had 13 fights, six included in the main card, and in the UK was to be broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face, UK viewers were astonished when the program changed to Peppa Pig.
Some didn’t surprise after they had to stay awake until early morning only to see the fight.
A follower on Twitter described the change to cartoons as “a heavy joke.”
“There is a government regulation that regulates the content issued from 6 a.m. and this was not suitable, so they had to change to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communication at Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa the grapefruit," yes.
Bellator’s president Scott Coker said they will modify the program to include British spectators in the next editions.
"When I think about the option of the broadcast, I think it can work," Coker said.
"But it's at 6 o'clock on Sunday morning, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our time, which would already be Monday for them.
We're seeing how to do it.
Believe me, when the programming was changed, a lot of messages were received and not all were kind, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a governmental problem.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are the ones we have usually made. We try to offer more than usual so that the fans were happy and we went through.
It is a very unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt lower for his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew down to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a triumphant.
At the age of 24, he told us that he didn’t realize until he came to high school that “not all were like me.”
In the first Desert Island Discs Radio 4 program, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said his intent in talking about gay rights was to transmit “hope” to others.
He also told us that becoming a father caused him to remain important in winning at the Olympics.
The usual presentator of this mythical program, Kirsty Young, will be absent a few months of illness.
In Laverne’s first program, Daley, who showed himself as a marginalized, commented that he felt “lower” to the rest during his childhood, because “it wasn’t socially accepted that you liked boys and girls.”
He said, “Until today, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what really has given me the power and strength to triumph.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals in the Olympics has become an outstanding profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to claim more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He told him because he felt lucky to live in freedom, without retaliations, and wanted to convey that "hope" to other people.
The three-time world champion declared that it was also a surprise for him to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who has been 20 years ago, although he specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you’ve been living so long since young” (he was at his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it’s difficult to find someone of the same age that has passed through the same high and low as you.
The couple had a son in June whom Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their "global perspective" had changed.
"If they had asked me last year, all the answers would have turned around 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is undoubtedly Robbie.”
His son is called his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn’t agree that he was going to die and in fact one of the last things he asked is whether they had passes for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I wasn't able to tell him that I wouldn't be able to be in the first row," he said.
“I had his hand between mine when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until that precise moment he stopped breathing and died that I realized he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“At that time I knew that was what I had dreamed my whole life: competing in the pool in front of mine at some Olympics, there was nothing better,” he said.
This was also the one that inspired him to choose his first song, Proud of Heather Small, who accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low shape, stayed in the bank at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to turn his shape if he wants to prevent him from becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who played at the event celebrated every two years to get a record for the 12th time, was disbanked by Captain Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of action, as he has so often done for the United States, the five times champion of major tournaments had to be satisfied with encouraging in some moments and, in others, trying to perfect his game in the field and thus be able to correct what afflicts him.
Never the directest of drivers, not even at the highest time of his career, the 48-year-old player is not in his best form for the Le Golf National field, where the rough long continually punishes with wrong blows.
And, if the field is no longer discouraging enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces the brilliant British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has joined debut Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games that have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below when starting the 12 individual matches, started in an impressive way, the Mickelson match could have been decisive.
Furyk showed trust in his companion, nor could he say much more.
"He perfectly understood the role I had today, gave me a hit on my back and, surrounding my arm, he said I would be prepared tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn’t imagine playing two games.
I thought they'd be more, but that's how it went out and that's how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, like the rest.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo's brand of more Ryder Cup games.
It could be the last of an entire Ryder Cups path that has never clearly matched the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wons, 20 lost and 7 equals, although Furyk said his presence brought many more intangible values to the team.
"It's funny, sarcastic, ingenious, he likes to mock others; it's great to have it in the team," he said.
“I think younger players have loved to have it as a support, also this week; it was fun.
It brings a lot more than just game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that although you enter with a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match in Valderrama, where a group captained by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point advantage over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to end the others by picking their heels for a minimum margin, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“Do not stop reminding you that we made a great tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brookline and lost, we did it in Valderrama and won, but for very little,” Bjorn said, portrayed, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and leading it with a 10-6 at Le Golf National yesterday.
The story will teach me and everyone that this team is not over.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Go out there and do what you have to do.
This does not end until the points are on the marker.
We have a goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that’s the only thing we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, neither more nor less, than the world’s best players.”
Prideful about what his players have done in a very hard golf course, Bjorn added: “I don’t want to go ahead.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are individual performances and this is different.
It’s great to share what’s happening with a companion when things go well, but when you’re there alone, you test all your ability as a golfer.
This is the message to be transmitted to the players, taking the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you can leave your companion aside, go and get the best out of yourself.”
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to make his players do it better individually than they did as couples, with the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, which add three four-points.
The same Furyk has been at both ends in the last few days of those big tournaments and has been part of the team he won at Brookline and then lost when Europe carried out the "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every word," he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
“We have 12 super-important matches tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When we all move forward in one direction, all pressure falls into those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and made them out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow.”
We assigned Thomas the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main party, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
"I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the entire tour," Bjorn said about his individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy fragate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old ships of the Cold War Age, but it will not be done until at least next year due to defective systems and the progressive increase in costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship heading the new fragates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to statements from a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery have deteriorated the conclusion of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class that requested the Navy in 2007 will replace the old fregates of the Bremen class.
We know they will include a powerful canyon, a set of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-boats, as well as some invisible technologies such as highly reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, continuous delays have caused the innovators (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its overseas power) to be already old when they start to provide service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 fregate occupied headlines last year, when the German Navy officially rejected putting the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a ship after delivery.
It was little known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of crucial “software and hardware defects” that left the vessel virtually useless if it was sent to a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, as the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half of the staff in the former Bremen class fragates.
It was also found that the ship has excessive weight, reducing its performance and limiting the ability of the navy to add future updates.
It is believed that the 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as other similar class ships that Germans used in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price of the entire project, including crew training, has also caused a problem.
It is believed to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), instead of the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems attached to the new fregates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings on Germany's naval power reduction.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy is “fucking without boats capable of deploying itself.”
The officer said the problem has been worsening over time, because the old ships were dropped down, but they have not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates have been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust Spies the Secret Life of Murcielagos
This new research, which has been carried out in a state of the Scottish Highlands, tries to discover how the murciélagos use the landscape in their food search.
Everything that is found is expected to throw more light on the behavior of the only flying mammals and help guide the next conservation activities.
The study, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common and soprano murciélagos, as well as the river murciélagos of Daubenton and long ear browns of the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations of the property to track the activities of the murciélagos during the season.
The NHS template and volunteers will also conduct mobile research with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds collected in the recordings to discover the frequency of the calls of the mushrooms and what species do.
A report and habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed image of the environment and its behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for mushrooms and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands and how forests should be maintained for murciélagos and other associated species.
Populations of murciélagos in Scotland and the UK have been significantly decreased in the last century.
They are under threat by construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk for them, as well as insecticide papers and other chemical treatments of construction materials or domestic cats attacks.
The murciélagos are not really blind,
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique that locates ants and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is taken very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who are dedicated to regularly conducting surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescue.
The organization has inaugurated even the first and only reserve dedicated to Scotland’s murciélagos in the state of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten murciélagos species.
The director of the property, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Threave, we have a fantastic area for mutters," he said.
“We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the right habitat.
However, there is still a lot of unknown things about the mushrooms, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop.”
It emphasizes the importance of checking whether there are mushrooms before carrying out maintenance tasks within the properties, as a colony of breeding can be involuntaryly destroyed and 400 females and young people could be killed, which would suppose to annihilate a whole local population.
Murciélagos are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them, as well as to destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to collaborate.
He said, “We still have a lot to learn about mushrooms and many other species that we don’t know how their populations evolve.”
Ronaldo denies complaints of rape at the same time as his lawyers pursue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has catalogued complaints of rape as "fake news", and says people "want to get to know" at the expense of his name.
His lawyers have received instructions to report the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
The frontman of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of paying $375,000 to hide the incident, Der Spiegel said Friday.
With a Instagram Live video that has already accumulated 142 million followers a few hours after the news was published, 33-year-old Ronaldo has tapped the report as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false," says the five times winner of the Golden Ball watching the camera.
“They only want advertising at the cost of my name.
It's the same story of ever.
They want to become famous with just mentioning me, but so, I can't avoid it.
“I’m a happy man and everything is okay,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit to Der Spiegel for accusations that appear in what they have called “an inadmissible report of suspects in the field of privacy,” Reuters reports.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will try to get a compensation for “moral damage for an amount corresponding to the severity of the vulnerability, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years.”
As it appears, the alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room and there he allegedly violated her anally, according to documents registered in the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga declared that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him that he was in a “99 percent” a “good boy” and had disappointed that remaining “one percent” of him.
The documents stated that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but was consented.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and took photographs of the wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to get to an extrajudicial arrangement because he had "terror of reprisals" and concerned him "be humiliated in public."
The 34-year-old woman claims she is trying to cancel the deal, since she remains traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged aggression occurred, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer has changed to the Juve, a large Italian football for a $100 million contract.
Brexit: UK would always regret to lose car manufacturers
The UK would “repent all life” if it lost its position as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Industry Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worry" that Toyota UK would report to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of customs delays in the case of a Brexit without agreement could lead to loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactured Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced around 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain breaks with the EU at the end of March, there will be production stops in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have shown their fears regarding the EU’s exit without an agreement, especially in relation to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says he will close his Mini plant in Oxford a month after the Brexit.
The main concerns car manufacturers relate to turn around the problems that could arise in the assembly chains in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is based on the adjusted production mode (“just in time” or at the last moment), where the parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and the EU suppliers to manufacture cars on custom.
If the UK leaves the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, a border interruption could occur which, according to the sector, could cause delays and decomposition of parts.
Toyota would be impossible to host the amount of material equivalent to more than one day inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said and, in such a case, production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan, where future relations with the EU are established, is "accurately calibrated to avoid such controls on border steps."
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that not only allows us to get out of the step well right now, but we have to take advantage of the opportunity," he said in the BBC Radio 4 program Today.
“The evidence of Toyota, among many other manufacturers, is that we have to be able to continue with what, until now, has been a tremendously successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production would stop, but he warned that, in the long run, additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the responsible for the Unite union on the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, once these jobs are lost, they never recover."
A government spokesman said, “We have launched a precise and convincing plan to delimit our future relationships with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could postpone again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Vice-President General Rod Rosenstein might "post another week," as the dispute on candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues, White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special advisor Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in the Russian elections, links between Trump and Russia’s aid, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation of whether Trump decides to fire the general deputy chief executive or not, and thus compromising Mueller’s independence has fed Washington’s cotilles for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded the talks he held with Trump with a microphone he himself carryed to try to relegate the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied that it was true.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House, between news where it is claimed he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (which was at the time in the United Nations in New York) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer to fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid conflict with the hearing of the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual aggression, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate charges against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would suppose to delay the Senate plenary vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, he said, “No date has been set, it could be this week or another could be postponed, considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We will decide on the march and I will inform the press, how I do.”
Some journalists would refute that statement: Sanders has not held any press conferences at the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said the shortage of press wheels was not due to an aversion towards TV journalists who act greatly, though he said, "I didn't disagree with the fact that they're fanfarroneing."
She then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
“The president makes more questions and answers than any other president before him,” he said, while citing without evidence: “We’ve contrasted those numbers.”
Press wheels will continue to be performed, Sanders said, but “if the press has the option to ask the president of the United States directly, I think it’s much better than doing them to me.
We try to do so many times and have seen us doing so many times in recent weeks, so that this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or press wheels with the dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences with him take place only in very rare occasions.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president demonstrated why he was so, where he made a dismayed appearance and, sometimes bizarrely, to the journalists who were gathered there.
Secretary of State of Health writes to NHS Scotland EU workers about their fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State of Health has written to the EU template working at Scotland’s HHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire to continue with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK retired from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working on public services that are not dependent on central power.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “During the summer, they have followed the negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the departure in which they chose to make the expected decisions this fall.
However, the UK government has also intensified preparations around a possible scenario where it would not agree.
I know that all this must be very disappointing for you.
And it is therefore that I would like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals across the EU and other countries provide valuable experience and many skills that reinforce and improve the work of health service, benefiting patients and communities to which we serve.
Scotland is, undoubtedly, your home and we would love to keep counting on you.”
Christion Abercrombie is operating urgently after suffering a wound in his head
Christion Abercrombie, Tennessee State Tigers player, was surgically intervened after suffering a head injury last Saturday, when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the rest.
"I came to the band and fell down right there," Reed said.
Both coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the bandline before placing it on a bed and leading it to be examined in depth.
A member of the Tennessee State template told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in its first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, with which he summed a total of 18 throughout the season.
Foreigners will apply a higher farm transmission tax when purchasing a property in the UK
Foreigners will apply a higher farm transmission tax when purchasing a UK property and the extra money collected with this measure will be used to give cottage to the “no roof,” according to the new Conservatives’ plans.
The change will neutralize success harvested by Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters
Increased farm transfer tax will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year that will be aimed at “no roof”
The additional money that is collected with the increased farm transfer tax to foreign UK property buyers will be aimed at aid to the “ceiling-free,” Theresa May said today.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is harvesting with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger and harassing voters who have higher income.
The increase in land transfer tax will be taxed to people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK and that money will be aimed at encouraging government policy to combat the problem of believing in the streets.
The recharge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, including the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand housing and the "buy-to-let" system, could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s new-built properties are buying people who do not reside in the UK, causing the rise in prices and making it difficult for people who buy for the first time to access affordable housing.
Many of the country’s most adverse areas (especially in the capital) have become “phantom cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new policy arrives just a few weeks after Boris Johnson claimed a reduction in transmission tax in order to help young people buy their first home.
She accused large builders of maintaining very high prices in properties by buying avidly ground without intention to use it, and urged Ms May to eliminate the quotas applied to affordable housing to solve the "shameful housing problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and the end of displacements without reason.
It also proposes to grant local powers more powers to build new housing.
Mrs May said, "Last year I said I would devote my position as Prime Minister to restore the British dream of improving the lives of each new generation.
And that implies resolving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who don’t live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy housing more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a house has become something too difficult to reach for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep in the street is still too real.”
Jack Ross: “My primary goal is to drive Scotland”
Sunderland’s coach says his “primary goal” is to become Scotland’s coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotland is illusioned with the possibility of revitalizing the northeast club, which at this time occupies the third place in the League One (the third division of England leagues), at three points of the first.
He went to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a cap B," Ross told at Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a child and it’s something he’s always made he wants to come back.
That opportunity will only become reality, however, if I manage to run a club successfully.”
Ross predecessors as Sunderland leader include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he felt no fear when he went to such names established in such a large club, after rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Right now, the success for me is measured depending on whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
Because the structure and facilities of this club doubtless correspond to that of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get it, but I could only consider I’ve achieved my goal here when I can return the club where it should be.”
Ross has only been as a coach for three years, having been a time as a assistant in Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the Hearts technical body.
Then, he helped the Alloa recover from the downwards to the third division and made St. Mirren be on the edge of the downwards to win the championship in the next season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably an authentic crossroads," he recalled in reference to when he took over the Alloa.
“I always believed that the direction was what was best for me, much more than playing.
It may sound rare, because it was good, I could gain my life very well with it and enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer the stress and pressure of that work; however, in the direction I feel good.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’ve managed to do so, it’s the time of my adult life in which I’ve felt better, undoubtedly.”

According to a survey, the perfect time for a paint is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has driven gains in British pubs struggling to survive, but focused all the pressure on restaurant chains.
The pubs and bar groups saw their sales increased by 2.7% in July, while restaurant profits dropped by 4.8%, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, from the CGA business consultancy, who was responsible for collecting the figures, commented: “The heat of these days and the fact that England continues in the World Cup have still made the pattern of the previous month of June, in which pubs increased their profits by 2.8%, although restaurants have fallen even more.
The decline of 1.8% in restaurant commercial activity in June was even worse in July.
The pubs and bars serving primarily drinks had their strongest month, in front of most restaurants, where they reduced the profits.
Pubs that serve mainly meals also suffered with heat, although not as drastically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out to drink.
In the managed bars and pubs, drink sales increased to 6.6% during the month, while meals dropped to 3%.
Paul Newman from RSM’s host and leisure analysts said: “These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of very important social or sports events remain the most relevant factors in sales on the outside of the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year will be especially painful in view of continuous cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have come at the worst time for gastronomic operators and the weather will tell if the most moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
Total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand deployments.
At Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the UK’s restaurants, bars and pubs sector, performance data from 47 operating groups are collected and analyzed, with a combined billing of more than £9 billion and is the market reference value.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media behind their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) have secret accounts on social media behind their parents and teachers, a survey reveals.
The survey, conducted to 20,000 high school students, revealed growth on false Instagram pages
News has accumulated fears of publishing sexual content
20% of students claimed to have a "major" account showing their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) create social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth experienced in false Instagram accounts, a reference site to share photos.
The news has accumulated fears of publishing sexual content.
Around 20 percent of students claimed they had a healthy "major" account that they showed to their parents, while they had other privates.
A mother who was accidentally encountered with her 13-year-old daughter's secret site saw how a teenager encouraged others to "violence me."
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistress Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children aged 11-18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Directive of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to be part of the directive of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the administration body.
Doyle is the most award-winning athlete in Scotland’s track and field and his president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who claim sport to benefit from his great international experience in the past decade.
"Eilidh is recognized and respected throughout the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and the entire world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously by counting on her in her directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I like to be the athlete spokesman and hope to be able to bring things and help develop the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta among the four golds he won and now is an usual BBC expert, suffered a transitory ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time would determine if I would recover or how far I would.
It’s been exhausting, but I managed to recover completely, I had to learn to walk again and I’m currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!
The announcement of sacchaleches compared to mothers with cows divides opinion on the Internet
A sacchales company has divided the public opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares the mothers breastfeating with cows they breastfeating.
To mark the launch of what in theory is the “first silent sacchales of the world,” consumer technology company Elvie published an announcement inspired by a video with somewhat ironic music showing mothers the freedom that the new milk extracter gives them.
Four real women dance in a pan filled with hen as a dance track, along with cows, with letters like: "Yes, I dream alone, but I have no tail" and "If you don't notice it, they're not ubre, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues to say, “Order them, order them, I am feeding their babies, order them, order them, I am feeding my wives.”
However, the announcement, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, has created a huge controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it manages to focus on the milk sector’s “horrors”.
“A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
Like us, you have to be pregnant before birth in order to produce milk, except that they take their babies away days after birth,” a person wrote.
The milk extractor Elvie is discreetly adapted in a lactating feeder (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented, "Traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to announce a milk extractor for mothers who are left with their babies?”
Another comment was: "There's a more discouraged advertisement."
However, other people defended the announcement, like a woman who admitted that the song was "destructive."
“I think it’s a great idea.
If you still get breast, I'm sure you'd have one.
Using the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The announcement is a little attached, but I don’t turn it anymore.
It’s a product genius,” a woman told us.
Another person said, "It's a fun announcement aimed at mothers using a breastfeeding bomb (sometimes at workplace or in public toiletries), making them feel like cows.
In the announcement, the dairy sector is neither praised nor judged.”
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discrete pumps placed inside the fasteners.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who take milk with the bomb say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and is discreetly coupled within the breastfeeding feeder, making it possible for your users to move, fasten their babies and even go out to the street with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD of Mother, comments: "The Elvie Pump is so revolutionary that it was deserved a daring and provocative launch.
By demonstrating parallelism between expressive women and dairy cows, what we intended was to draw attention to the use of breastfeeding bombs and their challenges, while demonstrating in an entertained and close way the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new bomb.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb appears in the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children paraded the gateway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of minors migrants discreetly displaced to a Texas border camp
The number of minors immigrants detained has experienced a considerable increase, despite the fact that the monthly flow on the border has remained practically at a regular level, in part because the hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration are complicating the possibility of paddling these children.
Traditionally, most patrons, who were also undocumented immigrants at their time, feared that proposing to welcome a child put their own stay in the country in danger.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential parent and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration government entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Office of Immigration and Customs, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who requested paddling unaccompanied minors.
The agency confirmed after that 70% of the arrested had no criminal background.
“About 80% of sponsors or their family members are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
In their efforts to prosecute minors more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear before the court within a maximum of one month since the detention, instead of 60 days, which was the prior rule, according to the workers at the host centers.
Many of them will testify by video conference, instead of in person, to defend their legal status before a judge for immigration matters.
Those who do not consider themselves suitable for the support will be deported as soon as possible.
According to host centers workers and system reports that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the greater the likelihood of anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent raids or escape attempts.
According to the advocates, these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as Tornillo’s, where it is more likely that, due to its size, the signs of discomfort in these children will be overlooked.
Furthermore, moving to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye from their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on U.S., France and Turkey’s “occupational forces” to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, foreign minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the war in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Vice Prime Minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of the fight against terrorism and that the item “will be addressed accordingly.”
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he told the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism has almost been over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been rooted out of their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight in this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories" from both the terrorist groups and from "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to the Kurdish and Arab forces of Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 land soldiers in this country devastated by the war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem claimed that the appropriate conditions were given for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "sowing irrational fears" that made refugees decide to stay outside the country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a contention zone in Idlib’s last major rebel bastion has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale assault of Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the agreement had “clear times” and has expressed the hope that military action will focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), who will “be eradicated.”
Staffan de Mistura, a special UN envoy, hopes to soon summon the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and move the way to elections.
Moualem established the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, arguing that the panel’s work should be restricted “to review the articles of the current constitution” and warned against any interference.
Why Trump Wins Second Terminal
According to that logic, Trump would win the reelection in 2020, unless, as many liberal spectators surely expect, a destitution or a scandal will finalize his presidency prematurely.
This would certainly be “the most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!”
There are currently no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, indexes achieved at maximum audience times have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and virtually tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million spectators in the top audience hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has exceeded cable channel indexes with 3.5 million spectators for major night news programs.
“It’s a strange attraction that we still can’t understand,” says Neal Baer, author-producer of “Designated Survivor”, a dramatic series of ABC on a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip you made in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why? asked.
"Because it makes me laugh," it was the answer Scovell received.
Chaos is always rising in the world of entertainment.
Obviously, and unlike everything else on television, the arguments leaving Washington could determine the future of the Roe Case against Wade, the possibility that immigrant families can meet or the health of the global economy.
Disconnect is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can be allowed.
However, the information exceeds the boundaries when you realize that you have been watching a panel of experts for six hours debating the use of the sources of "deep background" that Bob Woodward used for his book "Fear", the $15,000 Trump Storm Hunter.
As for me, I will never see Super Mario in the same way again.
“By offering something new every night, it’s partly what makes everything look like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars”, when he talks to us about the Trump show’s alternating distribution and his daily spins of the plot (whether it’s going into a fight against the NFL or praying Kim Kim Jong-un).
You can't let yourself miss an episode if you don't want to stay behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, I had a sunny day of 27 degrees on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was refugee inside home watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not leave the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judicial Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on a thread.
“I remember when in those days we did all those crazy programs and people told us that that was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” said Fleiss.
“I thought it was all a joke, but at the end it turned out they were right.”

Foreign money flows in the House’s tightest half-mandate elections
It is not a surprise the flow of money that is coming to the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the restructuring of a Congress district with two candidates seeking reelection for the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburg, whose structure was recently redesigned, has Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is facing another candidate for reelection, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, a district that largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dictated in January that the former districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a financing dispute for campaigns between the major financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb’s name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special election held in March for Congress District 18 of Pennsylvania.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a slight advantage.
U.S. considered punishment of El Salvador for support to China, although after she dropped back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a pleasant meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a Panama hotel until the partners dislodged the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials decided to return to heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to sanction El Salvador, who had already received aid of around 140 million US dollars in 2017 for, among other issues, drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts on financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings advanced, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to avoid migration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made clear that their intention was to continue the conference, which put an end to any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is planning to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and that diplomats are seen as a sign of the importance that the administration has given to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new threats or punishments by Washington.
A spokesman for the White House of Bolton rejected commenting on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to treat internal deliberations under the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
The Study of History
The next planned step could be the report of special attorney Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public record.
It is thought that Mueller is also being investigating the possibility that Trump campaign would work in parallel with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress changes his hands, Trump will be seen giving accounts before that chamber, just when he prepares to come back to the voters, and perhaps finally to a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditional, and therefore I do not suggest that Trump’s fall is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the dispute.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler, and the West had only needed to resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of meatwork that followed.
The course of history turns around these bending points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing several of these revolving points.
What will we do if Trump dismiss Vice-Fiscal General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller’s investigation fate?
Rosenstein has been seen in a good one since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his inability to charge.
Rosenstein says The Times' explanation is not accurate.
“How will we answer if the new investigation that the FBI has requested about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his position in the Supreme Court is confirmed despite the credible allegations of sexual aggression and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in half-mandate elections a Congress that will account for Trump?
If we fail these exams, we will meet a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once had occupied my house as a ambassador.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table adorned with a svastic.
With that inheritance, how will I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimist for the Rapid Vienna meeting
The Rangers will play home on Thursday against the Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive empath in Spain against the Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to rank in the European League G Group.
A knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from achieving his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 stake against the Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a trampoline for bigger things.
“We managed to get a good point, because the Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old player.
“We started the match believing we could get something and left with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved the victory at the end, but in general, the empathy was perhaps a fair outcome.
They were better in the first half, but after the rest we went out for all and we were the best team.
We will have another great European evening this Thursday.
I hope we can achieve the three points, but it will be a difficult match because they have already achieved a good result in the previous match, but with all the audience supporting us, I am sure we can advance and get a positive outcome.
Last year it was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but it is now noticed an overall atmosphere that everything will go well.
The team is fine, the kids are enjoying a lot and we are having a good training.
I hope we will be able to move forward, leave the past season behind and achieve success.”
Fear of retirement savings is causing some women to lose their sleep
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted them to be taken care of, few people talk about this with their family members.
About half of people who participated in Nationwide’s study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about this issue.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not taking steps to have this conversation,” Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide Life Insurance Company, says.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you will not be able to prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes sufficiently in advance.
Work with your advisor and family to talk about where and how to get attention, as these options can be a cost-determining factor.
Include in conversion to your financial advisor, as it can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses or secure yourself with your own savings, provided you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: go forward to legal battles.
Be sure to obtain a health care power to designate a trusted person who supervises your health care and make sure that professionals meet their own wishes in case they cannot communicate.
You can also prepare a notarial power for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your invoices are paid if they are incapable.
Don’t forget the small details: imagine your old father has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that it is always at hand.
“There are not just the finances that are at stake: what doctors should be treated with?” asks Martin.
"What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Everything needs to be planned.”
They shoot a man with a carabin in Ilfracombe several times
They have shot a man with a carabin several times while going home walking after leaving at night.
The victim, a 40-year-old man, was in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe (Devon) when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 (British time), as a "random act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
Their injuries are not mortal and the police have appealed to possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, authorities said.
With blocked communications, assistance officials have not been able to obtain any information from the Donggala regence, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km (180 miles) coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, which is a hierarchically lower administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel mines also have their importance in the province, but are focused above all in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunami several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine deadly victims.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Belt, a area of great seismic activity, and is often undergoing earthquakes.
Below we summarize some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis of the last few years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the province of Aceh of Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, provoked a tsunami that affected 14 countries and took the lives of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of death victims on the island of Nias, opposite the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake destroyed the southern Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that affected the southern coast, with nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake hit near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A little deep earthquake hit Pidie Jaya’s regent in Aceh, causing destruction and panic by recalling the devastation of 2004’s deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time it did not cause any tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of large-scale earthquakes that caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
Sarah Palin's elderly son arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaska Governor and Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for charges of aggression.
Palin, 29-year-old and citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to the report published Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he removed his phone.
Palin has been declared a preventive detention at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is retained with a 500-dollar unsecured bail, KTUU said.
He was presented to the court on Saturday, where he was declared "definitely innocent" when asked for his statement, the chain reported.
Palin is facing three minor offences under Class A, which means it could spend up to a year in prison and receive a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of a minor B-class crime, with a one-day prison penalty and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges are filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the Alaska veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, intervening in the complaint of a domestic violence crime and possessing a weapon in a state of drunkness, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed he hit his face.
Several groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her child’s violent behavior to the post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deadly victims
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5-sized earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks have fallen and the number of dead is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just next to the centre of Sulawesi, located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media that show the time of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors exceptionally seek death penalty for suspect of terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike track on the West Side highway of Low Manhattan, dropping pedestrians and cyclists on his way last October.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed all eight victims and caused "intentionally" serious body injuries, according to the notice of the intention of a death penalty application, submitted in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges involve a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a large federal jury filed Saipov an allegation of 22 charges including eight charges of murder with organized crime, which often use federal prosecutors in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “a substantial planning and premeditation,” according to the prosecutors, who described the way Saipov carried out it as “atrous, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to Diego Enrique Angelini's families and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a case of death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealerships, but was finally sentenced to life sentence in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal New York case was to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were condemned for conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant originating in Uzbekistan, demonstrated its lack of regret during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he told investigators that he felt good for what he had done.
According to the allegation, Saipov told the authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested the ISIS flag to enter his hospital room, police said.
He has been convicted of the accusation of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public advocates representing Saipov, said they're "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek death penalty instead of accepting a statement of guilty with life sentence without possibility of liberation will only extend the trauma of these events for all people involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for death penalty.
Tory says Nigel Farage should take care of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
Former UKIP leader said politicians had to "feel the heat" of the eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's members suggested he should take care of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Deputy Peter Bone said at Birmingham's concentration that the UK " would have left" if Farage had been the Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge that First Minister May faces to reconcile her divided rows has even more highlighted when a group of Tories in favour of permanence have joined an opposite protest against Brexit in the city.
The First Minister is struggling to keep the commitment plan signed in Chequers amid the attacks of the Brexit-favourants, its opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the "chaos".
Member Bone said at the Leave Means Leave concentration in Solihull he wanted to reject Chequers’ plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a position with responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have already gone out," he said.
This Parliament member for Wellingborough added: “I’m going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said, “We have not struggled in world wars to be served.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed the suggestions that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and we want to stay in the European Union is completely false.”
Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also in the concentration, where he told reporters: "I only say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public doesn’t like Chequers’ plan, the opposition will not vote in favour and is not popular among our party and our activists, which are those who actually leave the streets and vote us first.
Forget Chequers and start listening.”
In a message to May, he added: Prime Ministers hold their charges when they fulfil their promises.
Farage told the concentrates that they would have to make politicians "feel the heat" if they were to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell you that we're not going to let them go with theirs."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
“We will mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, the stay-friendly travelled the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour mitin in the center of the city.
Some activists rode Tories Against Brexit letters after the group was presented this weekend.
Labourman Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with an application of the match during the opening of the conference.
“These are the same people who tell us that they can implement computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus, for border in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren considers all the chances of presenting himself for the presidency
U.S. senator Elizabeth Warren says he will "consider all the chances of presenting himself for the presidency" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a municipal meeting held Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, an usual criticism of President Donald Trump, will be presented to the reelection in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chairman of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It has been considerably speculated about the possibility of Warren to face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
One assistant asked him whether he was planning to attend for the presidency.
Warren said it’s time for women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes there’s a woman at the top.”
An arrested for the murder with firearm of LSU Sims player
Police in Baton Rouge (Luisiana) announced on Saturday that a suspect of the death was arrested by shooting Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player, last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11am.
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify a man seen in the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot near Southern University campus at the first hour of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a shooting wound in his head that eventually caused his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday for 247 sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being on the scene of the crime, possessing a weapon and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and arrested in the police department in East Baton Rouge Parish.
Sims, a 1.98 meters tall Baton Rouge player, played in 32 games last season, holding in 10 of them, and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas ranked ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes team orders would have an important role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost forgot to throw Hamilton by defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter boxes and let Hamilton run into the group’s tail, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went out strongly later and stood behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after an action with almost glued wheels that made the Ferrari driver stopped the interior free at risk of resisting after a double movement to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old that day, began from the last row of the grill and placed in the seventh square at the end of the first round.
He then led a large part of the race while holding up his tires to achieve a quick end and overcome Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth position.
Finally, he entered boxes in round 44, but couldn’t increase his pace in the remaining eight rounds by recovering Raikkonen’s fourth position.
It's been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman leaving me to pass.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect couple," Hamilton said.
That has been a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday for his insistence that he did not filter Christine Blasey Ford’s letter in which he accused of sexual aggression to Brett Kavanaugh, the nominated for the Supreme Court.
Speaking in a mitin in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony offered by Ford to the Senate Judicial Committee, but said that what happened in the Senate showed that there are people who are “bad, repugnant and false.”
“The only thing that might happen and the good thing that is happening in the last few days in the Senate is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, repugnant and false,” he said.
"When you read the posts and leaks, and then they say, 'But if I didn't.
I didn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t filter it.”
Well, wait a minute.
No, we haven't filtered it," he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter detailing Ford’s charges against Kavanaugh in July and was filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leakage would come from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t filter her story,” Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
“She asked me to keep him confidential and so I did.”
But his denial didn’t seem to sit well to the president, who during the Saturday night’s midnight commented the following: “I’ll tell you one thing: that’s been a really bad body language.”
Maybe it didn’t, but that’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense to the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to recover power by any possible means.
“You see evil and repudiation, no matter who they hurt, who they have to hit to get power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired the defeat on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the match back on Saturday for 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants achieved an initial advantage of two goals thanks to the attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie obtained the local empate before Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard matched Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured his victory.
This has been the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who came from beating Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three matches.
Dwyer’s first goal arrived in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to Kendall McFaull’s attendance, while David Rutherford provided the assistance for Beauvillier to double the advantage four minutes later.
In what can be considered an extremely animated initial period, Sullivan again put the local team with desire to play at the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to match the match at the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer made sure the Giants would take advantage before the first rest when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first part.
The local team re-aggregated and Bouchard once again matched a goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the first leadership in the match at the end of the second part and secured the victory with his team’s fifth goal when he approached the end.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, play at home to Milton Keynes in their next Friday match.
Air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape in the earthquake plane
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being acclaimed as a hero after he died after making sure an aircraft carrying hundreds of people could safely leave.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after a large-scale earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The strong replicas continue to beat the area and many are trapped among the debris in the city of Palu.
Although his companions fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu’s control tower.
He remained firm to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, could safely leave.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was going down.
She died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, the Australian channel ABC News said.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts break up when they hear this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach several thousands of people. The national disaster mitigation agency claims that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to rise, as there were still many corpses under the ruins and it has not been able to contact a lot of people," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the agency.
Waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will celebrate a massive burial on Sunday.
Assistance and supplies are being brought to military and commercial aircraft.
Laugh Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance with more bodies comes.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survivors in everything possible, but we don’t know what they’ll find there.
This is already a tragedy itself, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s army: “I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are they ready?” CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been struck early this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Air Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini says a man disappeared after air accident in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says a man has disappeared, after saying the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated healthy and saved the dropping plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that from Saturday afternoon you could not realize a male passenger.
The airline said he was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or his nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the aircraft crashed against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had moved to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the track.
Some witnesses believed that the plane had exceeded the landing track.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
“That’s extremely good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes comments that he and other travelers managed to move forward through a water that reached their waist until the emergency departures of the plane that started sinking.
He said the flight attendees panicked and shouted, and he suffered a mild injury to his head.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who were doing nearby a spring improvement work also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane dropped about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Aviation security network data indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor concluded the presentation of his arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He exposed to the jury how he used the mobile phone records to chain the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old accused, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, thus contradicting his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the street on Sabbath and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis said the truth when he said he was on the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "minting, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Mobile records indicated that they were met only a week earlier.
Rowlett said sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He deleted her from her life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to start its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be in the hands of the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is Hip Hop Conscious?
A trio of hip hop wants to fill his music with positive messages to remove the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, states that the hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and dealing with social issues.
They want to return to their roots and make the conscious hip hop popular again.
Interpreters such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York babysitter demands a couple for fire after a "racist" text
A New York babysitter will sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after mistakenly receiving a text message from the mother complaining that he was “another black person.”
The couple denies being racist and compares demand with a case of “extorsion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her consternation when she discovered that the new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending him to her husband, he was sent to Maurice twice.
After realizing his legs, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice claiming that her former babysitter, who was African-American, had done a bad job and instead waited for a Philippine, as stated in the New York Post.
Maurice received the pay for the one-day job and was sent home to Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for a compensation for the dismissal in order to receive a compensation of $350 per day for the six-month domestic work position for which he had been hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show you that things aren't doing so," he told The Post on Friday and added, "I know it's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to claims that they are racist saying that the completion of Maurice’s employment was the most reasonable, as they were afraid they couldn’t trust her after offended her.
“My wife had sent him something I didn’t mean.
She's not a racist.
We’re not racist,” husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone with whom you have been disobedience, even though it was mistakeful?
Your newborn?
Come on!"
Comparing demand as an “extorsion,” Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a “very difficult situation.”
Are you going for someone that way?
That’s not that it’s a very decent thing,” the investment bank added.
Although the legal case remains ongoing, the public opinion court has been hastened to denounce the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not identify with a speaking bear, a new letter reveals.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It was hard to get into the place of someone who read it for the first time before her publication.
It’s really fun to know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
After saying that his father, who had previously worked as a BBC camera, was inspired by a toy bear to write the book for children, relied that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was somewhat "sweet" after his death last year.
From Paddington, to whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father was very proud of her final success.
“He was a very quiet man and he didn’t like to boast,” he said.
“But as Paddington had been so real for him, it was almost as if you had a son that achieves something important: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
When she landed, her daughter was urgently moved to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad regularly called to say that the situation was really bad, that it wasn’t expected to achieve it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received Nad’s call to tell me that I was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you a lot, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping slowly exhausted and left his system.
She had died earlier and everything was turning off.
I just could sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t grow, scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep myself firm.”
Finally, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering for her daughter’s loss, embarked on the plane alongside the other passengers, outside the terrible experience he was going on.
“No one knew,” he said.
“I hit my head and my tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Women in mourning put cards to avoid suicide is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicides are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Galese bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Ms. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any father to feel like I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that their smile lights anywhere.”
However, he left the job before he died, as he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at that time, was the one who found him after taking his life away.
Ms. Davis said, "I am always concerned that I can have impacts."
Davis created the cards so that people know that there are people you can go to and whom you can talk to, even if he is a friend.
Don’t feel silent, you have to talk about it.”
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or anything like that,” he said.
“A couple of days before Christmas we noticed his change of attitude.
Christmas day came to its lowest point: when the kids opened their gifts, he didn’t even look at them.”
He said his death was a big trauma for them, but they have to overcome it: "Leave a vacuum throughout the entire family.
He's left us destroyed.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on a thread when the FBI starts investigation
"I thought that if we could really get something like what I was asking for (a limited investigation in time, of limited scope), we could perhaps bring a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "going to pick" in the middle of a partisan paralysis.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to be carried out?
Their denial is entirely due to chronology.
Only five weeks lasted for the mid-term elections on November 6, and if, as expected, Republicans have bad results, their attempts to achieve the election of the man they want for the highest court in the country will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators, pressing them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the empate and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's desert figures "fall" with Kim
The number of deserts from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 deserts last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the strictest border controls between North Korea and China, and the high tariffs charged by people traffickers have been the key factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments on this.
The vast majority of Northern Deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says they have illegally crossed the border more than 30,000 North Koreans since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strongly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korea.
China considers deserts to be illegal immigrants instead of refugees and are often repatriated.
The relationships between the North and the South, which are still technically in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to have talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who generally agreed to work for a Korean nuclear-weapon-free peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for lack of progress.
"Without the trust of the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances, we will not be the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histerical" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the House of Representatives’ minority, said the nominated to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was a “histerical” and was not suitable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted in this way, they would have said it's a hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony Kavanaugh gave Thursday before the Senate Judicial Committee.
Kavanaugh served excitement to deny the allegations that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh showed himself very excited, sometimes almost screaming and moving while talking about his family and his years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned Democrats, qualifying the accusations against his "grotest and clearly coordinated diffamations" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s testimony, in his opinion, proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he showed his partiality against Democrats.
"I think you disqualify yourself with those statements with and how you've pursued Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi made his objections when asked if he would dispute Kavanaugh in the case that he was confirmed in office and that the Democrats obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll only say one thing: if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he'll not be fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, he'll not even be fit to be in the court where he's exercising now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible sentences against the Affordable Health Care Act or the Roe Case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether it would revoke certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is not the time for a hysteric and impartial person to go to court and hope for us to look like everything is okay,” Pelosi said.
And women have to handle it.
It's a justified diatribe, it's months and years of anger overflowing, and she can't release it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s so strange, right?”
She continued saying, "A woman who was executive in some company told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique for which when she was angry and started crying, I told the person I spoke to, 'Perhaps you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
No, I'm angry."
And then I remained with what I was doing.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as a way out of rage in part because they are basically not well understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, was once I found myself crying with an inexpressible rage. A senior woman, a serious manager of whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the cucumber and dragged me to a staircase.
"Don't let them never see you cry," she said.
“They don’t have any idea you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think you've been cracked up."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Colorado Democratic Congressman, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential careers.
In 1987, when Hart was taken on an extramarriage adventure on board a ship called Monkey Business for which he had to withdraw from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that there was no reason to unexplore the idea that she himself would present for the presidential race.
"It wasn't a well-premeditated decision," he told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Innocents.”
As the campaign was already very advanced, he remained behind fundraising, so he was promised that he wouldn’t enter the race again unless he raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave 1,000 dollars to men, to her only gave 250 dollars.
“Do you think I have a discount?” he asked.
When he pronounced his speech to announce that he would not have a formal campaign, he was so overcome by emotions (gratitude by the people who had supported her, frustration by a system that hindered the collection of funds and focused on the collection of voters instead of delegates, and rage to sexism), which was hurt.
"The logical thing would have been to think that he had had a nervous crisis," Schroeder said reminding the press reaction.
“You could have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember I thought, what are you going to put on my stone?
“Did he cry?”
Trade War between the United States and China Could Benefit Beijing
The first savings of the trade war between the United States and China were overwhelming, and although there is still a lot left for the battle to end, a rupture between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by placing tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant climb took place this week with new tariffs affecting $20 billion ($150 billion sterling pounds) in products, which charges half of the U.S. products entering from China.
At all times, Beijing has taken equivalent retaliations, recently applying five to ten percent tariffs on US products for $6 billion.
China has committed to equal U.S. attacks, and it is unlikely that the world’s second most powerful economy will soon get rid of.
Achievement that Washington goes back would mean to give up to the demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays their cards well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could help China positively in the long-term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can get the conditions for starting an economy fall in bite in any of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than spectators have recognized so far,” said Abigail Grace, Asian-based researcher for the Strategic Cabinet Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria claims that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and requests help in rebuilding a country devastated by a war that has been for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions were getting better.
“The situation on the ground is today more stable and secure thanks to the progress that has been achieved in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilite the areas destroyed by terrorists to attempt to restore normality.
All conditions for the voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to abandon it are already given due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that, since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people still living in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would be grateful to help rebuild the devastated country.
But he also emphasized that he would not accept a conditional aid or aid from countries that promoted the insurgence.
Europe is done with the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States now takes six consecutive defeats on European ground since the last time he won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn’s team achieved the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight during the majority of the tournament, launched his outlet in the hole 16 par 3, thus admitting his defeat against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari highlighted in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
U.S. Jordan Spieth defeated by 5 and 4 against the player with the lowest ranking of the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's number one player Dustin Johnson fell 2 and 1 in front of the English Ian Poulter, who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who already leads eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most victories of the tournament of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry, but today I can't avoid it.
It's been a very tough year.
I am entirely grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy I could get the cup back.
It’s a achievement of the entire team and I’m so glad I’ve been able to help,” an excited García said after the European team’s victory.
Now he passes the torch to his compatriota John Rahm, who already defeated the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday for 2 and 1 in a single game.
“I feel an incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods as I’ve grown up seeing this man,” said the 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 big titles, leaving alone behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had to fight throughout the weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team’s disappointing performance: “I’m very proud of these guys, they’ve never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we warmed the situation in Europe.
But we lose it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have made a very good game.
We will group together, meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and continue.
I love these 12 guys a lot and I am proud to be your captain.
Now it touchs us tilting our head.
They have overcome us.”
