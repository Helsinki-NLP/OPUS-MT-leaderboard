UKIP remains who refuse those who live with HIV are a perfect example.
You're talking about when Nigel Farage says that NHS should not be used to pay for those coming to the UK to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer asks him specifically if people living with HIV are included in the unwanted ones.
First you use specific arguments, then discredit them by barely hidden homophobia.
Every time I or my family need the NHS, we have to make the tail behind chronic hypochondria intolerants who think everything is due to them.
I think you are the one who uses specific arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-wing fools, doesn't practically exist.
I think that’s what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quotation from a torch is not evidence.
Yes, then shoot the messenger.
The Mail didn't write the report, he just commented.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such a populist propaganda as if it was reality.
I don't think you know what a specific argument is.
You don’t know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate by accusations of homophobia.
Farage’s phrase has a lot surprised, but only because we are so rarely talking about this problem.
He did not make absolutely any homophobic remarks.
You'll need to be able to get it back.
I'm not sure where you want to come from, but I guess you don't like when the media talks about what you don't like.
It is rarely talked about it because unlike Farage and his crazy disciples of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of mankind are something good, then not.
Finally, the situation is also cowardly in Ireland as in Spain.
With the new crisis that comes, the period of austerity will have nothing arranged.
Hoping for nearly 5% of growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland's 'EUROPE TIGRE' was boasted a few years ago.
We've met the later!
This begins to read the article again.
We are trying to make Ireland believe that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a “NEW ECONOMICS MIRACLE” is currently happening.
With the Brussels Agreement, imposts on the lowest societies in Europe, a tremendous flexible work walk, a continuing emigration.
With these ingredients not what to ''pavour''' at the moment with the arrival of the Polish.
In the 1980s of the twentieth century, irlance was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with Portugal Considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was ahead.
That their development was not a long quiet river, it is on the face of the recent events.
Lowest rate of impots in Europe?
That's wrong!
Latvia has a 0% stake rate on businesses.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France from the policies on the impots really paid by multinationals.
If one believes a report published in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become enormous again, and there are new (and cheer) cars in all the street corners, exactly as before the 2008 crisis.
I have lived in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery has been obvious in the daily caps since the return.
Is it supposed to be economic news?
Don’t worry, I’m sure the comments will soon burn.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in an A140 clutch.
Does Ryanair now want to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of devices, so a few bumps and scratches on the old will soon be forgotten.
That says I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of these two once shot.
That would be the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair pay passengers a supplement for the additional fear we wanted to provide them?
But without such Irish companies, you couldn't allow yourself to go on vacation, young man.
I never took Ryanair and the last three times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give it to the heart.
Any Ryanair article triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair instead of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay something other than the basic rate just have to take it for themselves, etc.
It's fairly transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what will be the delays and whether it will be necessary to compensate for passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that this was an error by airport controllers.
Passengers were placed in another plane in less than an hour, they have no compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome on board this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: Le Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally cracks of world.
People do not come in mass for the quality of restaurants (some conques, mostly) or for the Magazine Hall at the White Mantle Space (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the stores are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly alive and lively.
With a lot of foreigners who spend .....
Do you think the opening of Sunday is going to create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sunday, full of the world with 50% of tourists.
@Aloes False!
The only argument that I seemed acceptable is that of areas receiving a significant number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy in detaxes.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of revenue annually for the same reasons .
Remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows to lower prices.
Dominical rest is a right benefiting employees, except for exceptions.
This is why it is provided and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister of Economics nor the Minister of Foreign Affairs have no jurisdiction to reform the Labour Code.
While they lock it up.
What does the law serve?
To satisfy some of the population and companies that want to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday apm I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my city of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture...
This is also the regulation of working time.
The way of life he defended with toughness against fascism
The way of life he defended with toughness against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter’s succession was, against his will, to use to pay the costs of succession?
There are paintings.
Some are well, others are not terrible.
Perhaps his succession would want his part of the cake, if you give me the expression.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War.
And his hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole, and also add his well-known hatred from the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
I don't.
But for five years, and only for five years, he was perfect.
In 1940 he held head of the other government aristhos who wanted to discuss an “deal” with the Nazis and he was very skilfully winning.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
Inhabitants of the UK, France, Belgium, and, in the end, the whole world, can thank God for having had during these five years, just those five years, Churchill at the bar and no other.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell paintings on the free market to bring money from the succession costs, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them gather the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the money of taxes.
No one can deny that, when it was “the moment of truth,” Churchill’s personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A reinforcement of the internal market through public work will only encourage large companies, which will increase their dividend by avoiding hiring, with infrastructure plants being unrenewable by definition.
As for the social reforms recommended by the Minister, they well reflect the true evil: mistrust towards dialogue
Back to princeps values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
Let the weakest of us not be in need!
We are either in solidarity coming to help him, either he has RIGHT in exchange for the services he provides or has provided to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to semic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the donor who lives income from his property.
It is necessary to distinguish the one who invests for a return at the time of his retirement and the one who lives from his income.
A good to rent or even two for a couple above is vice.
The little engineer of finance lacks uniquely imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of deficiency in large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are overequipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, so a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline emerges in response to a recession that is only a wild decline so brutal.
You would have been right 30 years ago: no need (or possibilities) of dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energetic shock less harsh, then the need for investments is screaming: isolation, renovation of the railway network, urban transportation, transport and energy storage etc...
A tax that promotes high income and renters.
Who is in power?
Obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallopin.
Samsung’s profits are undermined by the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
Apple’s launch of bigger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in mid-September may have seduced buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all of these phones and decided for the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not for Apple.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft set up this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms to boost competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I love their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people attach no value to design, for them the options, functionality and price prime.
There's nothing wrong with this.
Let’s stop looking for a better platform.
Is there a "better car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar?
I would like to see a flourishing mobile industry, with radically different approaches for people and different markets.
It is healthier and must be encouraged.
This is our interest in all.
I’m happy that you’ve found exactly what you’re looking for and that it’s not an Apple product, even if I’ve made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our Umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, much on Parisian idiots) could tell us which author they fight ideas about gender and tell us the works they just want to fight.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemour?
Okay, Jean, I love you, and you are an intelligent and cultivated person.
I said that about Judith in the vein of Furusato mentioning Holopherne, approach that had not come to me (I didn't give his vibration of mind).
Otherwise, in the "back", since you return to it, this subject is not interested in me, and sincerely I don't see where the problem is: I hoped that you and your friends might get me out of my delay, because I'm slow but I understand well...
@Jean: Recognize that, culturally, Judith returns to Holopherne, it does.
Who is afraid is wondering the world?
But what are those who are afraid of?
Furasato and @ give us answers.
The first to invoke Judith of the Bible, the second to call Judith Butler a very symbolic throat trainer.
We see how intimately these studies affect at home.
We are obviously no longer in the idea debate.
That's something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read, John, that the World published an article on the need for theology?
@: As for an idea debate, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
It does not seem very rigorous to me to pray to fight ideas from the only exhibition that their detractors make (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Genre or X Lacroix, theologian).
But well, as I explained to our friend Umpfrontist, this is the entire difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not sure it's understood the shade.
I didn’t read Judith, the very symbolic throat trainer, I was satisfied with “Second sex” (it was more than my time) which I believe is the source of “the source” according to Lo’s wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon showed briefly when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and a little offset the disappointment of sometimes having blocked the sight by the clouds.
It was awesome here at FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud would really enter the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Special blood moon flash.
Tony Abbott/Joe Hockey make the Labor responsible.
But if the Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will give it its true colour as soon as possible.
It's obsessed with you, right?
I was in Melbourne then, of course, I only saw clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the week of the Perseid meteor rain and for virtually all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I start thinking that there is a bad genius whose only goal is to prevent the inhabitants of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is not really the best place for an observatory, even though things are greatly improving on the other side of the Cordillery.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I couldn’t see the eclipse because of clouds above Melbourne’s outskirts.
I'm going to put a tax on this eclipse.
WHO looks at this eclipse should pay a tax.
I bet that your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last before you sleep.
Who or what will obsess you when it ends out?
It seems that you’re spending a lot of time reading discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse EUX of being obsessed.
Great photo of the moon above Sydney Harbour Bridge.
Looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth!
Nothing about stock and real estate speculation.
Nothing about inequality between labour and capital income.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Ultra liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about Babylon's gardens...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
No hyperlink to original documents so you can make an opinion.
Go today and see the results of miracle revenues on Tuesday 15 October: in Spain, exports have been at the lowest for five years.
In Greece, the stock exchange collapses.
However, they seem to be the examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate an application for compensation for the order of 8 billion euros.
The Ministry of Economics says that these claims for compensation are not founded.
What about the mistake of the Ministry of Economics?
Will decision makers who have gained the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack of notaries have the same courage when submitting the bill to the state budget?
The suite in its time.
Okay, thank you, JYL...
@lol Not the State is not comparable to households in terms of the management of its budget because the State's time horizon is theoretically infinite while that of the household is bordered by the lifespan of its members.
Furthermore, unless public expenditure is considered improductive, they contribute to funding material and intangible investments from tomorrow's growth and thus future revenues.
A few elements of answer.
A regrettable decision.
But remember Hippocrates’ sacred oath: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved above all.
Beautiful conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth does not match your fantasy.
Medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands bound by law as written by politics.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical interventions, secure shooting rooms for addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues, politicians want to enjoy the incult masses.
In fact, doctors do not make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors do not make money with drugs Because Liberals want our health system to look like that of the United States, you should learn how it works.
All over the world doctors are brought in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
Perhaps it was wrong formulated to blame on tobibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to business benefits and “research”.
So read the few reports on our expenditures from Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare global prices of drugs present everywhere, as well as differences from country to country on what is on sale for free or only on prescription.
This is strengthened, it is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are doing testing on marijuana inhalation against oncological pain, despite the laws that break them and the expensive allowed requirements.
Although manufacturers of certain medications may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are used, those who achieve a version of good quality products at known doses will benefit largely.
I'm sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, there's a lot of things happening behind the scenes for doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a chief of this hospital.
We cannot hold patents on the grass...
If “social science researchers” were doing research instead of doing politics and networking, we could be using their “work”.
One researcher investigates, he doesn’t compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not searching.
Compare is doing pedagogy not research.
One cannot say, “Research is completed, we must apply it” and then in a single jet, “we must experiment with everything going on.”
If your research is done, why do you experiment?
If your research isn’t resulting, why do you ask that they are applied?
Can one explain to me how a “scientist” can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could assimilate mathematics and other matters more easily?
New technologies allow you to learn the condition that students learn to use new technologies but how would they get to learn new technologies if they don’t know how to learn?
Pisa tests are just an indicator we make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory for us.
What is it useful to build an indicator that informs you of what you arrange, a self-promotion will, a deception?
Only one track to train teachers: to remove sophists and ideologists from training and to teach practitioners.
read the paragraph on the internships (which is unfortunately not very argumented) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most ineffective conservatism: “It is a device that leads primarily to the reproduction of the practices in force, and that does not allow the system to advance.”
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, we cannot wish that only practitioners teach practitioners, even though they have their whole place in a modern teaching training.
Educational theorists must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose formation is purely theoretical, and who has never put your foot in an operating block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the educational system.
Giving more weight to educational theorists, it would be to destroy it permanently.
Your analogy is totally fair: if I would not like to be operated by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I would even less like to be operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned about this.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative Parliament in charge of the fight against copyright violation by David Cameron
Why doesn’t he simply tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
Thank you former MDR.
If one day I start feeling guilty of violating copyright, it will be enough for me to read an article like this.
In an information economy, violation of copyright = vol.
This is the same as they have to cite their sources properly.
Often, getting a license does not cost anything.
No, this is a violation of copyright.
Not the same thing at all.
By using content without having the right license, you deprive artists of their win-pain.
You can always debate peading hypotheses - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want it will not be true.
This is a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start feeling guilty of violating copyright
You don’t want to deprive artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school duties, an almost perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I am pleased to deprive them of this fictional income.
Lesson No. 1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their favorite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property to the site under the terms and conditions they have passed a click.
Perhaps if they share the headphones of their mp3 hiker with a boyfriend in the school bus, they should be expelled to have violated the law in such a way.
Ah, if we could export this resource we were full of, the ranger who says everything is wrong.
If it is a PS member who says it, then we must believe it.
I have two children and when they are in the age of choosing, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed from there.
France pulls people down by continuously assisting them.
I don’t want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What brings France down is speeches like yours.
@gus I’ve been working in private business forever.
I had the chance to have worked in companies led by excellent business leaders: it exists in France, but it’s rare.
I’m an employee because I know I don’t have the skills to manage a business and this choice allows me to shoot red balls on the zero bosses I meet frequently.
In my basketball I completely share the post by Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrible truth!
@gus, if we compare with German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to request reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, especially by ensuring the link between large and small businesses - What are French bosses expecting to do so?
May the state hold their hands?
This state they accuse of imperiality?
@Jacques L.
Always this anti-enterprise couplet from your part!
Remember me, you created as a job, as a value added, to be as severe?
@Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is facing an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders incapable of creating jobs and that boasts and minaudes while waiting for the Standing Assistant of the State!
It's terrible!
But they have solutions: deletion of the Labour Code, employer charges, taxes, working 45 hours/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare claim the decrease of wages otherwise their deletion!
I’m looking forward to seeing all the “negative” comments on this topic.
What is ironic seeing how people always complain about First Group.
Based on what I see from where I am, Last wasn’t really an investment for taxpayers.
They tried to keep themselves floating rather than transform.
That doesn't mean that Scottish railways haven't improved since Last takes care of it.
But they also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we don’t have the power to do this, unfortunately.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't succeed.
Well, the Labour will get us out of bored, isn't it...
It is an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the UK from creating a more moral business and participating in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good in management, most of our privatized services are ultimately managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all that so that the decision was finally cancelled.
And there’s better: MTR, a Hong Kong company won Crossrail’s 8-year operating contract.
Well, Labour, as they told us during the referendum campaign, is completely for sharing and sharing and believes that workers all have to help each other beyond the borders.
Therefore, we can assume that they will be happy with this decision ;)
This may be because the management of the Dutch is on good rails while that of the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of owner, but especially new ideas.
Abellio is perhaps the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchiser.
"She was a beating girl."
Lord, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that being "beating" is a higher quality than many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "beating" has nothing to do with that of surviving a disease: "beating" cancers, who are not less dead, I know of it.
Get out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Let's start again, too.
I don't tell you that this is the condition to manage, I tell you that it helps.
Nothing to do with any merit...!
When in the examples of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I'm gonna start again.
Insinuating, whether just a moment, that one may have merit to get out of a disease or that one may demeure from not getting out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that cowards everywhere, despite the will, despite the trust in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
I'm sorry to think the opposite, if, having a strong morale probably allows to easier accept heavy treatment and prepare for it, to attempt experimental treatments as this woman did and not refuse them with fear.
Someone who is beating in medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts medicine.
But if we prefer to get back to the "master" it's something else.
Neither with deserve nor with courage.
These considerations are suitable for moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you make yourself removed to the point of becoming just a zombie.
I personally captured two of them, dirt, big, and if I "beat" as these psychologists say, it's completely escaped me.
Unless this struggle consists of ticking the teeth, suffering in hell and beating.
I thought the charge against Milosevic was decided and completed about ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in the newspapers at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was carried out “fastly” and then whipped under the carpet.
Is this the story we told at the time?
The Communist became nationalist who triggered three wars in the Balkans over the past decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we have voluntarily left aside: 1.
How could NATO bombing be legal under the MOINDRE rule of international law?
Which country has Serbia attacked?
About RTS (Radio Television-Serbia), why not mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians, and then considered it a valid target?
Milosevic had no way to get out of it: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended him, he would be swallowed by the Western compressor roller.
The Westerns used a smoke screen to release a portion of a sovereign state which then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was closely recognized by the Western states who then lied from end to end on the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic clearance).
Vojislav Kostunica, which is mentioned here, died politically after his first mandate for failing to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
In the end, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic as a tyranny (even if we didn’t like it).
According to my knowledge, there is only a method of prediction of earthquakes in Greece that works approximately, measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This kind of study is undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from Earth in the Cygnus constellation, which would be “the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules,” according to a study by Demke’s Dr.
Method to follow, therefore.
Just like those that involve animals feeling a threat come up.
Thank you, Passor of Sciences, often enjoying us with these experimental prosperity that are done in the world.
How do animals know (in advance)?
Perhaps by perception of other elements whose rate evolves in the event of earthquake.
Like the radon, for example.
A priori odorless gas for man but may be detected by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measurement instruments he has.
But we have no reliable results on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen a art report telling the fighting of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to earthly magnetic fields, and especially their changes before an earthquake.
So I am not a scientist, but their hypotheses convinced me!
Or is it about this research?
Why so much contempt towards this track?
We should learn to listen to nature.
If we examine things quietly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious journal, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by animals, we face the same bias: everyone will remember that five minutes before an earthquake the red fish was strangely rounded.
I don't understand that we could think Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He has done it too much as a mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program, you can't stop thinking that this man knows nothing about it and that he's always trying to distract with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, then the presentator Nick Ferrari asked him what.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected as Mayor and he did not keep one of them.
It only highlights how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a shit, isn't it?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because it's a celebrity and people have been instructed to worship celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him and the same will be for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes party leadership, the popularity rating of the Tories will crash the ceiling I am sure of it.
May God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but don't want their prime minister to be a joke.
That's exactly what we said about Londoners.
He should have brought his friend with him the parpaing, smarter than him.
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one of them as President.
The French have really and always disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have been worth reading a few books (including a French and excellent of B).
Millot), the "Salomon" and the "Ferrail Strait" speak, unfortunately as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be there in the bottom since the Battle of Savo) do not want to return to it.
We are actually in front of the island of Savo, in the Iron Bottom Sound.
Even if the mission is to end.
They're the little ones.
But the ecolo side is a total smoking.
Calculate the kerozene consumed to achieve the objective entirely decredibilize the concept.
Just browse the list of sponsors than philanthrops.

I look forward to the web series!
Your recite makes me review, identifying a little bit at the passage (I also learned to navigate with the Crocos de L'Elorn at the White Moulin in rad de Brest!).
Hat also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of the movement.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to review us, and show with pride that the Bretons are great travelers!
Pierre, from Trinidad and Tobago.
I think the red cap that demonstrated against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Britain Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not devote a money of our taxes to fund the dreams of even a few adventurers as sympathetic as those there!
Are there any players in the current Serbian training of Kosovo?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly in Juventus and now in Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still in the team.
He's Bisevac, Lyon's defender, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was midfield or before in the 1970s and 1980s and trained many teams in Greece, but I don’t know where it is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attacker in the great team of Velez who, under the guardianship of the legendary Suleman Rebac, ended twice second in the Yugoslav League (and also counted points like Vahid Halilhodzic and the loyal Armenian teamman Bormorer).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course, I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just by curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
They said he was going to become a great player when he was at the Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was tied to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to Fener and as much as I know he is not holder there.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you are neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of today's real Albania.
Apparently it was the flag of Great Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little excessive nationalism, in fact.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (which I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Great Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give ends of the country to neighboring countries.
How can we feel "an explosion of joy" when we see two rounds collapsing knowing that women, men and children are inside?
How????
What a little bothers me in this "testimonial" is that the only fact that I could, once only, spontaneously rejoice the horrible death of thousands of people, testify in my eyes to a "border line" personality of which all "testimonials" should be taken with the greatest perspective.
Perhaps at the short time of "joy," we would not have thought of the dead or the reality of the inflicted horror.
We have just thought, for a moment, that for once, Muslims have managed to do really and apocalypticly badly to the great wicked Satan in his very heart.
To make qqch powerful.
It's great.
It seems that this feeling was shared by thousands of Muslims roasted by their feeling of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schaden happiness.
We were a little doubt.
The Western "Christian/White/Gaul" cannot measure the degree of fruit, anger, hatred of the Muslim when he contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural under-development of today's Muslim Arab world.
I'm talking about Cairo or Algiers, not Dubai towers.
The past glory, certainly magnificent, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How do you get the Muslim world out of this devil tone?
Totally in phase, two major poisons irrigate the Arab world: bigot conservatism of powers in place and fascinating nihilism.
The common point, the frost of thought and excommunication (sweet or army) of its critical expression.
That we have understood before, we shouldn’t get Muslims backwards.
That's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I guess this is true in many countries.
But in Britain, the autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, wet and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
In addition, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a bit for mood and well-being.
The autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The countryside in particular is breathtaking in autumn.
Not as breathtaking as the green summer when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Britain, if you are lucky, summer falls a weekend.
We had a beautiful summer this year, don't make your grinching that's whipping up the clips!
Not everyone.
I rarely fall ill in winter.
But now I’m retired and I’m no longer developing immunity to germs outside, it can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of drunk smells, with a febrility that culminates with holidays like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snow and full of other wonderful words.
Just don’t stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and grey months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the fiscalization of child increases , the amount incurred by the State is essentially from the deciles 8 to 10 .
But with regard to the number of households having seen their tax increase following this measure , it is especially the deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median income ) according to graph 2 .
The elimination of the half share concerning widows is not at all treated in the article or rather its impact is completely assessed: 230 million euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and understood that it is painless.
And it's not ready to arrange.
Well, we are not on the straw, but dreamers.
For once the PS makes a rather left-wing policy, we're not going to cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the 20% richest must bear much more than 75% of the tax rise, why not 90%?
Let’s keep so and you’ll encourage these 20% to work unless or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I still say it.
Live the Trots and OCI recycled at the PS: they have all understood.
Adam, you see what you look at.
The proportion is always the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population holds 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it forbids anyone to collect as much as he can.
Beyond some limit money loses all its usefulness.
And once exceeded the usefulness of money, money is only useful to make money, that is to say to make the misery of the greatest number.
We are one of the 20% richest.
Probably also 20% of the most working homes (and create the wealth of which a portion is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must allow these homes to benefit from a portion of their efforts.
Or so much lower arms and live social minimums, especially if you have a social housing.
Fortunately, the utopies of the red Khmer head cutters have lived.
I did two AirBnB in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to present ourselves at the reception or face any trouble.
Just go to someone, sleep there, keep behind and go back.
This will be my first option when I’m on a trip.
The logo changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases you will need a kind of owner insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Ah, six hours too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky" No, that's not true.
You just really missed luck.
Based on the link provided in the article:
At his discharge, Airbnb’s response to Teman was quick, almost absurdly quick.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided by Teman to Gawker, Airbnb had sent a lockwheeler to change the locks, taken arrangements to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why did this article cite Teman complaining that he has not received any support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I'm looking for people who've already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I’m planning to pay an income and a month of rent at a sudden but I’m a bit afraid to send £1,600 to a site I’ve never really heard of.
But where are we going?
“Support the troops,” the Bu$herey sang on all the tones.
Innocent weapons therefore.
I am sure it will be pleased to families and close to thousands of Kurdish dead in Halabja to hear that their relatives and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombing of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to stay polished).
Furthermore, what would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons found nearly 20 years later were still used?
It’s not hyper-clear the style of the author: “Seeking weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education.
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are always in war.
Alternative: Is it always time to strengthen education, because we are still in war?
Education would already be much strengthened if they were "worked" for 35 hours instead of 17.
At the moment, our teachers are earning more than engineers.
And don’t let us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program.
But it cannot be seen because National Education has no means of providing an office to its teachers at the college and high school, so they bow at home.
A kind of forced telework in sum, except that the employer does not pay the computer, the internet connection, or the supplies.
Moreover, it's so much the plank at 7am a week and 4 months of vacation that we don't get to fill the CAPES with maths, come, we're waiting for you.
How do you don't want to colt yourself out of poorly educated puppets whose parents screw on you by dealing with yourself as a breaker?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the Jihadites so that the Kurds population can better grow.
Where we see that the Bush administration has done absolutely everything.
My first graduate job was in sales, in London, to earn nothing three times and yet it was a job for which a degree was needed.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be a worker for the London subway, it was paid £5,000 more annually and it was not even requested the patent.
I never regretted.
About this, don’t worry if you don’t find a graduate job, try to find something either that pays well or you like to do.
If I had stayed at graduate jobs, I would still pay my student loan
I don't like business work so I hope to end up going either in public service or in the academic world.
LOL LOL This article comes really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011, there was already a three-year delay.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Get rid of bisounours fields such as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is, what is called unemployed degrees.
I have one of these degrees and I finished production director.
It turned out that the important thing was not the diploma but, as the article said above, a good professional journey, starting at school and throughout the university.
Certainly the starting salary was lower, but we quickly rise the levels because in the real world what counts is the results more than knowledge.
This debate of engineer/artistic studies has last for years.
Scientists cannot solve all problems, it is more important to be able to wake up in the morning, reach work at time, and interact with people in order to achieve results.
Letters, philosophy and art are bisounours?
It's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about the media study genre diplomas or whatever the absconse field you've gone.
Letters, philosophy, political sciences and art are real fields.
We need people who can explain the major questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the foundations of culture such as literature, art, etc., and emphasize them.
Wouldn’t this be better be a real territorial policy to devour Paris and dynamize the rest of France?
Personally, I misseen the inhabitants of the bottom of Essonne and Val-d'Oise take 80km back every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
Intra-muro inhabitants and the small belt already have many otherwise more practical means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).
> Several secure and closed parks, as there are already in the cities of northern Europe, Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by 2RMs.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
So much benefit from their great experience in the field.
Well, we didn't find a place for A ONLY bicycle clutch device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding a office for Bertrand Delanoë.
Well, it's not wrong at all.
When discussing with pedestrians and other users of public transportation, the bags are not adapted to the 100s, then it seems to me that the main reasons that show up are: 1/ it is super dangerous with all of these bagnols, these trucks, these motorcycle scooters are required to take care of the super-fast road and the survival of bicycles.
The cycling paths are apartheid, it is necessary to co-have but to rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in Paris?
Not a word on the bike square in public transportation?
EELV is right.
The target of 15% of veil movements is ridiculous.
I start to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the green in the flour.
Besides what OR reports, EELV Deputy seems skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, it would be better to find who really hides behind this massacre.
Index: It is not Russia.
Not sure to love the way the world evolves.
It seems horrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case to the ECHR, but I did not hear that a complaint has actually been filed.
In addition, they should file complaint first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be removed while waiting for the outcome of the accident investigation report and the criminal investigation resulting from it.
Yes, but Libya didn’t explode Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault is responsible for the airspace safety authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had been shot previously, Ukraine launched into the area of air attacks against the rebels, and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocents for airlines to pay overflight rights of the territory?
Where are all pro-Kiev trolls who defend their usurpating government/western Ukraine ultranationalists - and who want to wholesale demonstrate that Putin shot the MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the government of Kiev because they are responsible for what is happening in their sky.
A 1986 ruling by the International Court of Justice concluded that the CIA’s supply of weapons to the rebel Contra forces in Nicaragua did not mean the U.S. is responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will let this case go to the ICJ.
It’s funny to think Abbott means Putin that Australians were murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to support his allegations.
So far the investigators have not said anything about this.
If you call Ricardo and be such an eco-beotian, it's afflicting!
Calling Polaire is losing the north is delightful.
One question of the Beothians: Is the poor of today poor than the poor of yesterday?
I can't stop noting that those who most virulally criticize Piketty's book haven't read it!
It's easy to read, I took a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of labour income, capital property, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of today's capital joins that of the early 20th before 1914, it shows that it was the two world wars that dropped the concentration of capital from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: You say not what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that an individual’s capacity to concentrate has a few limits.
Then, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis that the press has given is fair or not.
If it is fair, we can debate it without reading the book which is essential to argue in one sense in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did you take to read it?
Is the central thesis of his pavé summarized by the press false?
I didn't read or read it.
So I rely on the summary of his central thesis and it is that which seems to me pure smoking.
The notion of difference between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Didn’t humanity become globally enriched?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the prize without any doubt.
But remember she's only 17 years old.
An age that most people just begin to find their place in the world.
I hope that this price will not be a burden for the girl and she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adjustment that colorful pervers are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes for happiness to Malala, but she must realize that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neighborhoods of Britain!
Did someone think his speech was a bit strange?
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she was not where she is now, she would have been married at the age of 14.
Isn’t Malala herself part of these “pervers colorful”?
You should not have any “antenna time” on this site.
You are yourself a horrible perverse.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her at the age of 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
His father leads a school where girls are schooling and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
He is, and has always been, for she to receive a higher education and for she to have the right to decide herself about her marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, as he thinks women are equal to men.
What she said is that an average Pakistani girl often should get married at the age of 14, without having her word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't mention it sufficiently eloquently for you.
This may seem contradictory, but maybe it means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at the age of 14.
Rather disappointed by this entry in season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who has a little trouble to find her sosie character by Marlene Dietrich.
I just looked at the last two seasons that are quite different but I must admit that it is one of the best horror series, one of the most outcome!
A fascinating first episode.
The performance is close to perfection and Jessica Lange’s show singing the anachronic Life on Mars of Bowie is simply overwhelming.
I haven’t watched this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story, I preferred to have all of a sudden than watching 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is sure, outside of Jessica Lange extraordinary, is above all the risks of scenes and mountings that sidded me.
In AHS we have a laval of original plans that ridiculize the aseptization of today's productions.
I am a little away from seeing you throw the sponge in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to chew the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series, but you say so well, there are many other things still.
No, it's just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and how she uses it) is really one of the pillars of the series outside of technical qualities.
Well, I look a lot for her.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, it wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 it was too scattered despite a few excellent episodes.
I don't see them do 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's going to end as 24 hours of time what.
But everyone does whatever he wants.
That’s what I say “I’m not going to look later” that everyone is forced to do the same!
I simply share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she'll be fatal to her.
But afterwards, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - rather coup in state expenses.
No, let's increase expenditure.
Those who wanted to know in expenditure failed.
Discussions about relatively little expenditure positions, such as development aid
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about shades rather than the change of orientation that the voters seem to call their wishes, and during all this time some in each camp seem to be much more important and substantial than they are - and the voters see clear in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
"Debt" is assets mainly held by financial institutions in this country.
The “debt” is nothing to worry about.
I wouldn't see any problems that the government takes a third of my income (before even talking about consumer taxes) if I thought it was going to use it well.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers have the same feeling.
It is said that Nigel Farage was not entirely honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, almost unnecessary wind turbines and nuclear power plants that cost twice the residence they should.
Your first £10,000 are not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35,000 per year will pay about £5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay about £10,000 (a fifth), etc., and someone with £200,000 pays about £70,000 (a little more than a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking costs and car vignette, and that’s before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and car vignette.
I'm paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it’s a problem, of course, I’m happy to pay my taxes.
But let’s not assume that money falls from heaven, or that it’s not important to know where billions of pounds of taxes spend.
How can an unemployed who seeks work at the door-to-door prove that?
While even 20% of the unemployed wouldn’t seek, that means that 80% are looking for and don’t find.
If I’m even unemployed, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
If a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CV, it increases my chances as much.
Actually, I haven’t heard any news from Employment for months, does it mean that agents are more busy in check operations than really getting job announcements back home?
I don't see the interest.
Because it is not the state to provide work.
If Pole Employment doesn’t provide enough jobs, then you need to get away from Pole Employment.
What is a sensitive topic?
We all have rights and duties; in this case, we ensure that unemployed people fulfil their duties in the contrary to their rights.
Just as a controller requests their title of transport from users of a means of transport, a chief of service or employees of their work, etc.
No one cries to the scandal in these cases, isn't it?
It is really good to recall that unemployed people have rights: the only two times I dealt with the Employment, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the cases, amputed by 40%, we had to battle firmly.
It takes time!
I am not a law expert.
Fixing and control takes the top currently, while statutoryly Employment is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the topic of compensation should only be concerned by employees, they are those who pay the costs.
The non-wage politicians and French people are granting the rights they do not have!
That's not normal.
I would add that a worthy unemployment insurance participates in the value of employment.
More than waiting for killer tweets in Arabic.
In fact, we need to have a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop ISIS so that this virus does not reach this zone of conflict.
The situation would then look like the spread of the black pest in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudi people had the presence of mind to prohibit the Hadj in Mecca to Muslim pilgrims coming from the three affected countries this year.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have seen their visa application refused due to their country of origin or recent trips.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim coming from Bosnia who contracted the variole in Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim coming from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Does it be heartless to suggest preventing Ebola’s sick from planning a plane to Europe?
I thought it was just a good sense, but apparently those who know decided that we could risk the lives of ten thousands of people...
These West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be put in strict quarantine.
No one goes out.
Only health personnel can enter.
Wait 21 days after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are healed.
These are not draconian measures.
Only last week, people were contaminated after having contacts with people in West Africa although they took “all necessary precautions.”
We can stop the advancement of this disease.
It spreads mainly by airlines.
Let's forbid them to offer them to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms, so that they can be immediately placed in quarantine.
That he can pass the message of the first individual and the group (including religious) second and that he will have deserved the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt whether he is able to dogmaze the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It is still far from that concept.
It’s only 20 years ago that information has appeared as the given premium of humanity, while religion, out of the beer, leads our actions since perhaps Lucy.
What is the interest of becoming an entire Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed that Catholicism is largely minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not put their feet in the church anyway, there is only to see the low number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxiogenic"?
@Louise: Sorry the church has no vision limited to France.
And in the world, it may be that will touch more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) respect for others as you envisage it was pre-existent to Christ.
Hillel a century before said, "Do not do to others what you don't want to be done to you, that's all the Torah and the rest is just comment: go and study!"
Christianity goes far beyond simply reciprocity but introduces agape.
Your "making progress to justice, peace, brotherhood" but without God?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Next step: Incarnation and resurrection are removed.
Jesus will remain this hero who has disturbed moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be willing to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I remember that the small number of Protestants in France is primarily explained by the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted to force and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I’m not sure to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game will soon come out.
It's not invented.
I personally would choose myself.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in his fundraising campaign) but I don’t think it’s worth £30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'm gonna watch.
Of course not at work.
The IT department’s joy rabats block all nice sites.
Hello, is it £30 and then 20% discount, or is the £30 include 20% discount?
Please note, however, that the PC version is only for DX11.
It surprised me, I bought it, but I can't play it.
In addition, I bought it on Steam, so no refund is null.
It's time to buy a new video card.
It’s a Brazilian website, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn’t use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they're going to erase it from your library if they're going to make it against the people who buy it there while they're out of the planned area.

So, was France of 1940 a "putty land"?
So tell me, this Nobel prize looked like a gift poisoned.
Should we love France of 40, that of "the strange defeat"?
When you see who gets the Nobel Literature Award, you wonder whether Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
Nobel is not even an event, we don’t even want to read the award-winning authors.
Will Brazilians, Chinese or Australians read Modiano, which is already hardly readable in French and describes a so limited and self-centered universe?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but honestly I doubt.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Have you read it at least?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for Chinese, Brazilians and others, don’t worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will appreciate M.
Modiano at its righteous value, if they don’t already know him!
On your side, keep attending Lévy and Musso.
I agree with your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso retain all their chances.
So let’s see who won the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hey the fearful.
Since I driven one in Iceland, I haven't stopped seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think that thing has followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or eating me like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello Dantra, always hate?
Hello DQ - No, not today, I took my doctors.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days of rest.
It was cool.
Last weekend I went to the beer and cider party in Nottingham.
It was bordelic.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel is one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not only CAMRA fanatics (not to confuse with the camera fanatics).
Riding on Sunday's return was really tough.
Monday night we went to a buddy's grandfather to play the nine card brag.
Thanks to a real chance of beginner, I was able to go back with several decent bets.
I hope if I get 95, I will be as living as him.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks arrived with a slice of lard on it.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That says, without wanting to contradict you, I think you are a little away from the subject.
This famous entirety prohibits quests for Jihadists at the exit of the mosques.
She reports the weapons trafficking.
We have either open eyes like Meddeb and Taïa or Boubaker or we have closed eyes.
We need to choose.
It is not by keeping the eyes closed that we get access to the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again you make a monumental countersense: all of the representative authorities, organizations or associations, Muslims or not, who have formally condemned ISIS and its crimes, French, Muslims or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official convictions.
Who does not say consent.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, there is doubt for everyone.
As I said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the French Jews of Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand them to demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of the French society that it is wrong to doubt.
This principle is in my view the denial of the republic and can only contribute to the deliberation of French society.
If there is no doubt, I say.
Who doesn’t say consent but agree to what?
Agree to a close proximity to ISIS or the conviction of ISIS.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to house the goat and the hood.
Your position is intellectually honest, but pragmatically durable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, during the elections, “venge” the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap grew between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised before the referendum on independence.
Cameron has to be petrifyed to lose all these seats in Westminster.
Cameron must laugh.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives are completely shit off from Scotland since they have no seats there.
They can do what they want with impunity.
I don’t think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP is a good thing in the long term for him and the Conservatives.
Who is going to pour a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP that will cut their heads north.
Ed Miliband joined the "Promise" thinking he was saving his party but without realizing he was signing the death sentence of his Scottish members.
No wonder that some Labour members demand accounts from their leaders.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats are not from the Conservatives, they will be in very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and the Labour to do what they have promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's rather the important thing.
Not if the Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Closing pumps of 85% at the expense of 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once the Scottish members will no longer be able to vote on topics concerning England, the Conservatives will win all votes.
Oh, I think he's.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with Ulster's unionists and it succeeded.
Still, he is still in lice to be Prime Minister in 2015 and since he won the Labour Party leadership.
So, in whole, these boxes will be virtually behind each drive to look above his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and until the end.
This is the "Life of Others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC.
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the end, it will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I wait for the next ticket: Amazon makes YOUR book based on YOUR profile and this automatically through an algorithm of its secret!
It's happy as a world.
Strongly stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
Like in this system, DRM management is not implemented, I remain reading pirated files, public domain books or purchased from some publishers who have the intelligence to offer flushless files.
Given the price I paid the Kobo, it's without regret.
I am afraid of the widespread abdication of users to the widespread appropriation of their privacy.
At your broad public library, you will systematically notice that everyone gives its loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose rates of opening and completion are probably disturbing.

@Thomas: In the Big Data Age, the data does not really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put the whole literature in the same box.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile....
The harvest is not anonymous.
These are the data published by Kobo that are, not allowing to identify readers or authors.
But Kobo has all that information.
There have been so many exaggerated, wrong and contradictory statements from the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be led by a maternal class full of acid-based schizophrine kids.
It is even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism.
It’s interesting that some Erdogan’s supporters think that Islamist is such an insult that they suppress your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well viewed:-P But Turkey doesn’t want to shoot a bullet in the foot unless it won anything there.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will respond, so it is actually shooting a bullet in the foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog: “AP reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be an error to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad law because it would endanger Israel’s security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran sent there a serious warning of reprisals or simply advised caution.
This second option is more likely and, in all cases, what really surprises is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the region’s security.”
Indian Punchline's reading is strongly recommended to anyone who is attentive to the details rather than the c*neries scattered by the traditional media. The short article you give the link is important and should be read in mind by keeping the previous realistic observations / warnings from Iran to propose Afghanistan around 1979-1980.
Who are those “moderate” who seriously fight the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the pervers of ISIS?
Pipeline policy pushes the world towards abime and I would suggest those who refer to “moderate” inexistent to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending others’ children to fight in the Third World War.
“It’s even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism.” Are there other religious fundamentalists at power in the Middle East?
I have one in my mind.
A trial in Nuremberg for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks would be needed.
Would it "Need"?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims are likely to be alive?
A little late for that, my friend...
Wouldn't criminals be almost old now, like 120 years old?
A little late for that, isn't it?
Especially regarding the CUP triumvirate that planned and led the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed immediately after the First World War by revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a palmed place in Central Asia nearly at the same time, when he went to dream of founding a Turkish empire.
What a delusion!
An impressive mastery of the sophism of fatal slope, but other than that, we are looking for contact with the real in vain.
Just clichés without arguments.
The fetus will always hear a heart that beats even in the womb of a carrier mother.
Lesbian couples can simply be a child's desire and not a desire to be accepted.
Steril hetero couples too.
What about the kids!
What a shame to designate them as unbalanced psychological futures.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their lives and to pay the retirement of this lady (?)
The GPA is probably a provisional “solution” in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.
It doesn't date today.
Many women have worn and gave birth to children who were not their husbands.
It is still so, we are done so...
The important thing in this area is that this practice is framed so that the body's "marchandising" is limited.
But aesthetic surgery, cosmetics aren’t they as merchant bodies?
Anacronic faritude...
It is certainly more stylish to grow a good in a far-away country via the internet and Pay Pal than to endorse its responsibilities and to avoid scandal in another centuries near home without screaming it at that time on all roofs!
These practices were no longer done on behalf of the church!
There are not only Christians and believers who refuse these practices.
Not less remains that the exploitation of the bodies is a real problem.
Oh, silence, this man is passionate about something.
At the end of the 1970s in the Midlands I only saw that from far away.
I had to go there the day because I didn’t have the right to go there at night!
But if you like it and you listen to the music – this music today still touchs you as much.
I don’t know why there are so many despising comments here about what Paul Mason says, perhaps they’re posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sports section there is an article about football that awaits your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson’s film, there is a shortage of reports that really reflects the reality of Northern Culture of England.
No surprise that Paul Mason has well taken into account the social and political context, he understands things well.
The Northern Soul still lives, but it has been vampired by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
Said that, you can throw an ear there if you are in the London region in November: 99psul will again pass soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15, at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought “always the same story,” but here’s a little written and well thought article.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Super article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're happy to escape Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and down to Wallgate.
In gobant of pills.
Whatever the railway station before Wigan was Ince, 15 min walk from Wigan after bought a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The debuts of the Northern Soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the George Gently Gently Northern Soul series, which takes place in Newcastle in 1968.
Affairs become increasingly poisonous.
Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahu does not seek peace as he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (moreover, that was also the case with Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their voters all preferred occupation-colonization for peace.
He took off his clothes, lay them on the rock and entered into the water.
An Israelite stole them from him.
The Israeli representative was angry and said, "What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren’t even there at the time!”
The Palestinian Representative (UN) said and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian authority and will not decrease the guard.
That this is unpleasant to the anti-Israelis is obvious, it is not the intended goal ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered, I translated: the global geopolitical report...
And this has always been the way since the policy has been globalized...
Avoid, avoid...
In the Israeli-colonial conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain that it continues!
For the creation of Israel, you will not answer.
What relationship of strength allowed the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: Israel-Palestinian conflict is still a relationship of force!
Do you doubt?!!!
In addition, it doesn’t just turn around Russell Brand, but the Guardian journalists seem to have trouble going beyond anything he doesn’t have to say.
Many of what he says are only pseudo-chomskyst balls written no others.
This proves that you don’t understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a sequence of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes her, which would mean it's a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious burden, with just a suspicion of awareness that Russell Brand tells certain truths, perhaps truths you prefer not to think about.
Take attention, this feeling will be increasingly widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrors some: sometimes he speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of the tabloids he actually gives the feeling of being a beginning populist, but all this story of not voting has been completely wrongly interpreted according to me.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather to cross the arms and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at the interview of Paxman and other articles / videos that he posted to be, it says that it is essentially important to vote once every 5 years only for the Labour or the Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I suppose) and limit to this democratic commitment.
I do not say that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active by submitting his requests can go along with the fact of voting, because politicians are spikes that will really change their minds if they are really likely to vote), but it is hardly rageful to see all these condescending answers that say that Jesus is better to take this idiot.
Its solution is extremely questionable and it would be good if people were debating what he actually says rather than simply labelling it as irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left on account.
Yeah, thank you.
The thing about voting has been completely distorted.
The uselessness of dragging a newsletter into an urn every 5 years is deeply upset because my vote really counts for nothing.
I want more referendums, electronic vote, direct democracy and members who report locally to their voters.
Furthermore, I contestate the idea that Russell Brand’s words are not his own (written by others).
He is intelligent enough to have his own words and ideas, even though these are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and college students from the counterculture that Suzanne would like to group under the label "pseudo-chomskyst ballballs".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would be able to convince Suzanne.
Perhaps that’s what the Guardian could do, let Suzanne do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the head shakes added to the mounting!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russel but eventually became one of his fans and inviting him to his show, it’s too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come.
He draws out of a political speech that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by traditional media – including the Guardian – for generations.
This "frond" mostly reveals in my view that the intellectual debate has long been held in the history's RDVs where trade historians have become minority and where specialist exchanges have become poor for the benefit of loan-to-think condensed type Sciences Po for press files.
For my part, I had seen in Pierre Bourdieu's intellectual attitude as well as Michel Foucault's intellectual attitude, a need for a guilty guilty, an emissionary goat.
They develop both very rational reasons, but this rationality is based on these emissionary goats, which are the key to vault of their thought.
I rather believe that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a guilty.
This is a very archaic thinking, sacrificial thinking, which is also magical thinking.
We solve the problem of the report to the other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchising slope, neo-lib and/or libertarian (of both terms the second marks a hardening of the desire for the eradication of the state, the first who knows to go to seeking the state's aid for its markets) in the sense of at least state/not state at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that self-organizes beautifully.
His thought is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt she does not stand standing.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals cited here.
Not any support anyway.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old times, that of his god of then, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oula, you may have read a chouya too quickly if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian Revolution for Khomeiny's apology.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel through this.
Gauchet puts a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty represented by the membership mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether you agree with him or not, he's an original and respectable thinker.
Seeing this cabal orchestrated by hard-left human sciences researchers who do not sustain that we pass from loyalty to their mantras, is quite laughable.
The narcissism and authoritariansm of these people is unlimited.
An important point to add to me seems to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other "yellow" whom I have been witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure to hear our Australian friends about this, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don’t remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time.
In London and they were friendly to me when they learned that I was a Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
Chinese people think the same about whites.
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou long ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them hold violently anti-white speech.
My father isn't happy that his older daughter comes with a white.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially over the past few years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity spreads outside the major cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
As I have been told, the Russians above all have prejudice against temporary non-qualification workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in jobs and in areas where they have a lot of chance to be exploited by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the river Ienissei in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard Australians’ opinions about Chinese and Aboriginals.
It’s really strange that a stranger tells me that I don’t bear the Chinese, while I met two in my life (including one abroad), I didn’t keep bad memories, all people worth it, and in fact, those in London were very nice that’s the only reason why I remembered they were Chinese.
Otherwise we don’t remember who we meet, all people are worthwhile, how to remember who it was.
Do you know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here talked about Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with that white.
How many Chinese men are with whites in comparison?
None, because there is a lot of chance that the parents of these Whites would physically attack them.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
Nevertheless, it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by strongly marked left-wing groups such as the union of the magistrate.
@Marabout: Sorry, but the judicial environments are honestly marked right.
When in the union of the magistrate, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its partiality can be made from the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it orders to remove two obstacles.
The political vision of the observer as the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
It remains the required tool of the law to refocus the assessment on the fundamentals.
The measure of its failure to comply with all judicial acts of judicial magistrates, including prosecution, forces to make a distinction between the error and the partiality of judicial magistrates.
It would be useless to claim that acts of justice are not divided between these three groups.
Pretension and misunderstanding are not covered by an objective analysis.
And if all this is not analyzed, then how can we affirm that justice is improving in France?
If it is only by implicitly revealing statistics that it comes from well-low.
The previous preamble enables the following to be correctly entered in the third ratio.
The corruption of the magistrate.
Sensitive topic as a proportion of the power of harm* which is conferred on to the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The field considered is the splitting* of heirs committed through frauds to the procedure by successoral genealogists entrusted by notaries.
This profession earns €150 million badly, while benefiting from the coverage* guaranteed by the quasi impunity* of the French notary.
For the understanding of their mechanism, a party was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this joins that statistical improvement* moderate by the previous commentary, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogist and legacy reluctant to thus be pulled up, a whole set of jurisprudence contrary to all laws favorable to the legacy.
Isn't then the presentation of European statistics ignorant of this kind of rational criteria an elaborate form of lie?
Probably totally prohibitive prices.
Another equipment to scam people with disabilities.
We can say that, but my brother has one of these all-field tricycles, built tailored to his size and weight, and that really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like never a normal wheelchair, with tires and wheels, couldn't.
As it is said, the colours and colours...
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair is Epic.
I think Whill's inventor never had to clean a dog crab on a shell.
I'm sure my sister would love the tricycle anywhere, but it's just too expensive.
The long-distance ultra wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled with a slope for longboard.
Here there are hills that would like them.
Prices seem really high, but there are really people who put this kind of price on a bike, so “you see.”
The tricycle of any field seems particularly useful to me.
Not everyone with disabilities is poor.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance at their disposal.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can allow themselves to practice high prices for things they know that they are needed for us.
We cannot really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, it's just a draft, it's not planned to make it.
I READ that the "long distance" wheelchair doesn't come to the market, because apparently there's no way to drive this fucked thing.
Almost 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombings of densely populated residential neighborhoods.
Two million human beings have been prisoner in the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half of them are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-old children have lived all their lives under Israeli blockade.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation, illegal situation as well, since this blockade inflicts a “collective punishment” to all civilians in Gaza.
"The entrepreneurs who work on their projects turn a little bit of their cement to the black market."
Oh, that's not the wooden tongue, rather concrete and armed the lady.
The references are here to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The right cement goes into the tunnels!
The black market is certain and recognized.
Two million human beings have been prisoner in the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and moral sense.
The United States has a well-kept land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to rule because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) has excluded it!
Remember also that after he lifted it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I am a Western, so I agree...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is Israeli-Egyptian.
The children of Gaza live on a underground fortress, built on the back of the population who has chosen their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you thought well.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the economy of sharing, non-profit.
Many are just looking for a shot of one night on Couchsurfing.
So it is to be paid (or at least hoped) in a different way.
It is always much cheaper than a hotel, if you need to look for the right addresses.
In addition, owners and tenant who trust themselves often stop using Airbnb and deal directly with cash, contouring Airbnb.
Where is the community in all this?
“What does she rent on?”
No problem with the verb, what is the problem with your grammar?
The verb “to let” is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you wouldn't have noticed.
It would be better to have good insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% compliant with all the security rules and ask those who manage channels and rivers to authorize to practice a business activity there (what they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (in honesty) on Airbnb, in short, it's really...
Have you thought of the fact that the boats can be moved, stolen and painted, sinked, etc.?
The peniches are so slow that if someone was trying to steal it, she would still be close to where you left it.
Or diverted by pirates...
All those Somali immigrants who come here and attack our peniches...
Where are you going to love him?
No Marine Le Pen is not right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than the one that exposes the facts.
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who defends what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to poverty!
High finance, speculation, plays with our companies, so our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, our foods, so our food, with the care structures, so our health, with our debts, so our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and our money they hold.
All this in the benefit of some hyper-mega-obesity of money.
Until proof of the opposite, FH said, "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Minister of Economics of the Rothschild Bank, a history of better defending the interests of bankers, alone responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there anyone else computing?
Do you call it how: turn his jacket, down his pants?
Primary and populist reaction
In fact, we don’t know too much what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I’m not sure that Spee really refused to rescue the survivors.
One of the aspects of this battle is that none of the parties seemed certain of the enemy's exact strength.
Robert Massie in his book “Castles of Steel” suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British coach in the area.
The sea was hollow at the beginning of the day; I don’t know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after the sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Malounians, where, on the pictures showing the survivors being rescued, you see a quiet and day-light sea.
Furthermore, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, it really doesn’t match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
There was some confusion among the German ships as to the fate of the two kirassed cruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after they stopped the shooting, and a race-suite started.
Leipzig saw something in fire, but when he approached, he saw that it was only a thickness.
Nuremberg, slower than other German ships, joined the battle lately and saw Monmouth, fell and severely damaged but still in movement.
After pointing his projectors on the ship's flag, the proposal to return was refused and he opened the fire, eventually flowing the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee believed that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped the research at 22:15.
Concerned with reports indicating a British coach in the surrounding area, he went to the north.”
So, if this is true, the Germans, tasting in the dark before the radar invention, did not know that a ship had sink, and couldn't therefore look for survivors.
They also thought there was a larger coach of the Royal Navy in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in the confusion they run away to enjoy their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should pave a path through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them wrong and had cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes are raised to the UMP to request that it be entered into the law that a permanently convicted elect is ineligible for this fact.
This is a courageous position, which would also touch the left-wing elects well over.
Noon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSE A RECOMMENDMENT TO THE MAGISTRATE CONS
When is the ban on trade unions in the already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always prompt to amate those who will benefit from their immovibility to hinder the actions of the real politicians, who are actually trying to move things, not the beautiful speakers whose immobilism is to the extent of their sufficientness.
I met them in the subway by noon with their small pancarts" of funds for justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized trade unions whose members put the enormous power they hold in the service of its party.
She would not defend the same theses if right or extreme-right trade unions designated the target of personalities on her edge and led to a legal-media war against them.
Your claims are completely free.
Yes, the right currently defrauds the judicial news, it is simply that it has committed facts that rely on it!
There is no example of left-wing personality that had so much to do with Justice, but everyone who was subjected to her attention did not have a favor treatment.
On the other hand, it must be reminded that the judge union which is on the left is not the only judge union and is a minority.
That a minister supports trade unions with so much commitment shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you cite is perhaps a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at the Chancellorship, it is not a secret.
We now wonder whether the "mission" of some judges is not more out rather than education.
@ gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: You forget that the magistrates are not officials like the others: they are the only ones to have the power to blame and imprison the all-one.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever returned?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I think even the most hungry foolish of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised that someone accepts their offer.
Many used it as a tremplin to start a successful career.
One Direction fill the stages around the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or went to West End.
Popstars, the precursor of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is among the jurymen.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all have made the Eurovision competition, like many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and all the rest have participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most British television light entertainment stars.
Of course, some have fallen into forgotten.
But this is what happens to most stars who do not participate in the competitions.
There are rare people who, after a tube, succeed in making others.
Anyway, most singers/groups can best hope for three albums and one best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name, has fans only in the UK.
Her celebrity comes in part from her wedding with a football player who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who is Jeremy Clarkson.
It can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it’s more chance to lead to a career than the typical rock path, even though in your dreams you think that all the guitar freshers that smoke grass in their father’s garage and balance three agreements on a primary school poem will certainly become stars and the only question is how much they want to to touch before even leave an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western audience and the people studied – a distance that quite quickly turns to racism, because sacralist ethnicians present us these distant people as infinitely superstitious and petrious of ritual bigotry, while most of their ways of doing are strictly equivalent to ourselves and ourselves.
Except that you interpret imprudently in the opposite direction.
Either, but rather than saying that the drum is lacking of sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières also have a little sacred character?
Our bias is reminded of seeing the sacred as a kind of well-defined and circumscribed object to the religious sphere.
Interesting article whatever it is.
It's deco ephemere to furnish the vacuum.
Nothing else.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw the orthographs of the interpretations at all scientists that last the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is a compared criticism of the disciplines to laugh a little?
Because what applies to archaeology also applies to the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of healthy modestness.
Your contempt to archaeologists is quite unjustified!
It is thanks to them that treasures are constantly discovered, precious testimony to reconstitute history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and before, archaeologists relied on their “instinct” and knowledge, and could be wrong.
Nowadays we have technical and scientific means so effective that the interprétation of the excavations is better but can still be challenged by other discoveries!
It is there in full (and old) controversy about shamanism advanced by prehistorian Jean Clottes (cf. his book "Les shamans de la prehistoire", particularly the augmented re-edition of the scientific controversy, published in La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this highly instructive article
Do heterosexual men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could get it.
So it's over between us?
I really don’t understand Why can’t we continue at three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, done for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the castle?
No, but we're not against a theatre play about it.
We couldn’t watch a musical comedy about it, but it would be too gay!
We could expect to have such a comment from you.
It seems Mary Whitehouse has come back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost over, I can suggest you go to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers Mikedow.
Can I suggest that we all were looking for a newspaper that pays for real journalists, courageous, to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their risks and risks?
Rather than getting kidnapped with these puppy ass jokes.
Not very clever.
Let's go.
If these "purily ass jokes" shock you so much, you're not obliged to participate, isn't it?
Do you also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an anal sex article?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh on it?
Nevertheless, we find the amateur video of the crash on the internet...
Amateur video of crash on the net...??
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images it is only to protect its interests in no way that of the driver.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the drivers, it would have left safety because at the time or another vehicle (e.g., washer) entered the circuit.
But it had to end quickly before the typhoon that we knew it was coming, but for which the FOM did not think it was good to advance the time of departure (tv right, pub, money...).
But other than that, they protect the pilots well.
Well, I also share this opinion.
But there is also that if the very British FOM enters the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance to beat the English that then led...
You're leaving yourself on this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's no matter, I've got a little time to find out all your c*****ries.
No, just no.
There were many conspiracies in F1 but never one that puts commissioners at danger of death for a distant story of the possibility of one pilot's victory at the expense of another.
It’s not the FOM that leaves safety because it’s the FIA.
Nuance of size.
Given amateur images, the absence of image especially allows the FIA to avoid disturbing issues of the type: How is the Commissioner stirring a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident, but because one of the Commissioners is clearly seen stirring a green flag, signs that the race can normally recover and is more under yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark misconception of the F1.
Yes, dear Etienne, the race is no longer under a yellow flag regimen ON the place of the accident, from which the green flag is stirred.
This is the usual procedure.
The post of commissioners just downstream the accident (depending on the case, it can be 10 meters or 100 meters after the accident) stirring the green to tell the pilots to regain a normal look.
Sensationalism sells a pub.
Before I thought the media was an integral part of the government’s “patriotic” propaganda offensive, but I’m very afraid that, in the end, it’s just for money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, fear of not having sexual life, the publicity and media are good to sell us things supposed to improve our sexual life.
The infos do exactly the same thing.
Buzzing with information that you really don’t need to worry about is just to keep scared of people so that you can keep controlling them.
“When the tabloids alluse about Ebola, we all catch the fear,” it should be “grabbing,” not “giving alluse.”
Given the medical reference, “giving” is much better said in this context than “giving”.
I wonder if all people who are afflicted that Ebola might begin to spread airly realize that they now believe in evolution?
You make them too much honor.
They probably think this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the apocalypse approaching.
Ebola is the Antichrist.
You confuse Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that beautifully and solidly ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism.
It made me laughing.
It depresses me that the media talks about most things with this optimism in the backwards.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently frightened and anxious (without reaching hystery) for the government to get us out whenever it needs.
I believe it is perfectly logical that, if we have to undergo a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any event?
It seems that this government seeks to save us from crises itself invented.
Isn’t there anything fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations for this post, and to be still from this world nearly 35 years later.
Besides at the beginning, it had to be horrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I'm bluff, living with the certainty to spend there for years .....
Perfectly useless testimony.
As always when you talk about science.
Not only does the testimony use nothing: taken in isolation, they cannot serve as a scientific material.
But they have a harmful influence on the objective assessment of facts.
@traffic: The testimony cannot serve as a scientific material.
Perhaps that's why you're abstaining from asking questions to psychiatric patients when you have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric record mentions that my psychiatrist mother explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
This is an objective symptom.
When I say it's fucking, it's an unimportant subjective testimony.
Ah, because the attesting of a fact (here is this testimony, which testifies the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) does not use anything in a scientific approach?
So what are you based on the research?
On fantasies?
Do you put on the same level of fantastic theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimony)?
“Resilience” is the word bite-adducted by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who consider themselves to be great psychologists after reading from Antwerp.
@Jim: There are plenty of empty buzzwords in psychologists.
Cyrulnik made us the “resilience” strike.
As he's a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he's squeezed us a reliable measurement scale to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Sentinels of the Air could all save us from Farage and company?
Don't you think about Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to get out of the Sentinels from the air...
And then why?
It was a great series and it seems that those who come out of it are aware of it!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to the Almighty who can do miracles.
But how are they going to do so that the kids are grabbing?
The only solution that comes in mind is the humour genre pipi-caca, which would kill the series.
It was already a kids' series.
The kids were hanging.
Oh, because it's a kid's series?
The UKIP works for the Mystery.
Keep your Team America.
Always in Supermarionation?
It will not be the same if you don’t see the sons and the animation is done well. :-)
I'm looking forward to seeing this (although an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a chain to rediffuse the old ones.
The series has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; it has been at least 40 years old that we have episodes of one hour on Saturday and Sunday at 6 p.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it has been on one of the second-order commercial channels and can still be seen at these times.
And in addition to half-hour episodes now go at 05:30, from Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a "sad" 60-year-old guy, but I don't watch this series every day!
There is no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the esplanade mosque !!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves a political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Furthermore, all Israeli excavations below and around the esplanade mosque for several decades have made nothing to be found.
The Mount of the Temple, if it exists, is elsewhere.
Can you be in Argentina??
This mountain is not sought for the mere reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of the mosques was built.
Its top, or dome of the Rock, is protruding in the middle of Omar's mosque.
For Muslims, Muhammad has risen to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it is the Mount Moriah where Abraham failed to sacrifice his son Isaac.
As long as it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts on its extremists, it is good to remind it regularly, and unfortunately they are relayed to the government (Naftali Bennett, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, who had accepted the two-state plan, and tasted it continuously!).
It is also good to show how peaceful the annexion of Jerusalem is not.
Can God recognize His owns?
The shortest of the Jewish joke: "God be praised!"
In order to boast tourism in Israel, we are often shown young naïades half disguised, linguistics on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, quite different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen on the photo illustrating the article.
It's still a little scared.
And this photo is a wonderful propaganda work!
Sadly that Reuters’ photographer didn’t photograph hundreds of Palestinians allowed to go back to Temple Mount and who prefer to cheat the Jewish faithful down, praying to the Lamentation Wall.
@Mat, if this picture disturbs you, it is rightly, it is neither the newspaper nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she transmits that it must be condemned.
This system is not sustainable and will end in crying.
The only way to end this system is the revolution.
Since the economy seems to go off, large companies have benefited greatly from their employees.
They managed to convince their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they gave the small elite at the summit increasingly higher remuneration.
You are right, it is not sustainable, but it will only change in this country when the workers will really speak with a single voice.
Instead of crashing and twisting when someone else strikes, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike does not only concern their problems, but also shows your employer that you do not punish people.
Unless democracy is abandoned, in that case it is sustainable.
I'm totally agreeing.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are worst.
For example, China and India.
All this cannot end well.
That’s because we’re in democracy that’s maintained.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (PTCI) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people by short-circuiting national governments by secret courts.
It seems incredible, but that's exactly what the dispute settlement mechanism between investors and states (ISDS) proposed by the agreement serves for.
The Greens are against this project and try to warn people about the unthinkable damage that this agreement will have on our lives.
It’s only recently we start to talk about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement so look at these links and you’ll understand what’s being negotiated in your back.
Didn’t Churchill say “blood, sweat, and tears”?
This is what makes great impacts, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to push on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the car market.
This man is right, in the 18th there were trade unions in all the regiments.
In the very Catholic French army there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let it (their officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe the safety of the eternal values of France, and she will fight and close her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, shortly: the dissolution of the idea of a nation, having this small relic, is comforting.
Although for her it is increasingly uncomfortable...
They still miss the union sdes men married, celibatary, married women, celibatary, lost dogs and I don't know what else
If you don't write the French correctly, I'm unionized.
You've been warned, it's your fault.
For the defence of category interests, protected professions with trade unions are already suffered well, which has created a breakdown of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of the risk of a staff member.
One can very well imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of speech without trade unions, or without the right to strike as in Germany, in the contrary to the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise catastrophe is guaranteed.
And with the carrettes that are preparing, the government congratulates it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to military and other officials, since this is the topic commented here...
Let's remove "through its delegates" in article 8 of the preamble of the Constitution of 1946.
It's going to be: "8.
Each worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions as well as the management of businesses.”
This is absolutely essential with the irruption of informative power.
And yet you’ve opened, probably read and then commented on an article specifically titled “The Great British Bake Off Review”?????
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought I had to start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding that I looked at, and I can tell you some have been well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey’s wedding, one of the best moments (although misleading: wine) in television history.
Also, from the cake mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in accompanied that, strangely, the show ends with a victory of the least worst baker; nobody has made it like "boom, this is my fucking cake now bow it and bow in front of your master!"
Perhaps the additional pressure of friends and parents outside eventually had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all of these external people were held away.
And there’s also this idea of “playing security, there’s always next week” that disappears last week.
I love cooking, but I don’t imagine doing this.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us super entertainment and drive us to try new things.
Ahead for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's last challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to do them and they had to squeeze one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to divide, I don’t know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real defect they could find was the base a little dry (even though I agree with Hollywood to say that the green ice cream on Richard’s mill did not envy, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I have to admit that several challenges in this series seem a bit artificial because of the time given.
There is also cancer watching, with solar wind shots.
Decisively, everything is successful at the moment.
A bad time to spend for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UVs are blocked mainly by the ozone layer which is formed just by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UVs.
So even if the magnetic field was weakened, there wouldn’t be enough solar wind to “hunt” the ozone from the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore fewer UVs and “cancers”.
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UVs.
They have a lot of useful functions that you do not suspect.
If we are limited to man, they have the interest to allow us to have bones (synthesis of vitamin D), to heat us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, seems, to improve our morality.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVCs and leaves UVAs and most UVBs.
Do you know that you are not obliged to be condescending and consider your interlocutor as a remaining person when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor accuracy that was understood in the comment, which he himself intends to show pedagogy.
Without saying that I am a used to melanoma, UVs only make ACCEILER its development.
They don't provoke him.
For evidence, not all bronzed people have melanoma.
Either, when a tobib tells you that you should avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because UVs are needed for every human.
The excess, however, is like everything: he kills.
But for other reasons.
UVs directly cause melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
or go to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be folded if we apply sufficient strength and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use to which it is intended.
I think the army would need something more resistant and therefore has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as first line communication equipment.
But for us others,
It's still a good choice.
The majority of those interested in this has established that everything can be folded if sufficient strength is applied to it.
Except for a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it ever folded?
We're doing this joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth joke about the folding I have read in the comments today.
It is difficult to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production channel and we see wrong how it could come back to it.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.......................................
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been installed properly and is therefore stuck with the installed factory test code.
I don't know how they're doing these things at all.
But would they put test software on everyone?
Photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
ah l article for bobo by excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that industrialists produce in "industrials' We highlight super u but all the signs and memes of small trade are concerned How to eat good, bio avac 1650€ (average wage in France)?
But to respond to your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After everyone is free to put his priorities where he hears it.
For me, the food is one.
Go with no rage, I kiss you
It is called idiots, or better idiots, people who see the world through an ideological “software” that leads them to disconnect from realities.
This is the total thought-reason declusion.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example, claim to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in turmeric, joining the left-caviar, of which they sometimes come from, for example, condemning CO2 discharges while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our citizens do not support this blend of heavy-duty ideology and worship also do not be surprised often meeting criticism about them.
Waoh, thank you for this complete and comprehensive theory as well as for all the related details (plane, shower...).
I'd like to be part of it, but I don't find it.
The concept is not so complicated.
Boboecologues are monobloc.
Did you understand the concept of left-caviar?
Well, you are able to understand the concept of boboecolo.
This is the perfect copy with just an ideological shade.
The classification would be more complicated if we interest ourselves in the ecoles shortly.
The boboecolo is part of it but represents only the most visible frange of the echoes because it is the one that infests the media.
This is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this giraffe in the face.
It is so badly made that it looks vaguely like a female naked.
Chut, you're next to the plate.
It is necessary to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the stunning beauty of truth of this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to comment because you haven’t spent countless decades studying and flatting great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin cannot draw and still seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic capacity.
That's art.
No, it's pig.
The fact that Emin does not know how to draw
This is not really a proven fact.
This is rather an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate is realistic reproductions of dogs that smoke by playing billiard.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is much more than simply representing the real.
If you're just looking for this, a camera will do the case.
The author also speaks of Emin’s expressionism.
Look again and let the picture speak of itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you may prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still something to save: horse riding activities, the number of Republican guard horses or the status of generals who are no longer active.
Honesty forces to say that France decreases its employees, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, to begin with Britain.
It's just half encouraging...
Operating without support, it quickly finds its limits.
A unique approach, at the time we observe the weaknesses, the deficiencies of our defense tool, especially in Sahel.
A bad hit for local authorities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, or even a portion of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuarization?
@edmond: That's what I said, look elsewhere to save, but especially not at home, at home, it's really not possible...
This is exactly what you propose to do, look elsewhere where the gabegy is certain.
Whether all those who have coined little or proved the military thing dare to come here, the eyes in the eyes that there is no wasted money in this perimeter and this without breaking laughter...
That the same potion is applied to the entire public service and public finances will go a little better.
And for Josi: really reloaded: Look at the inflation of public jobs in other departments and you will understand why Defense can consider itself a little loaded!
Yes, the savings on which everyone agrees to say they have to be done, although it must be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls gem at murder when it happens at home, the poor dear.
It should be done, but most importantly, that it doesn't fall on me because in this case it's a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How to close the Grace Valley will weaken our defense tool in Sahel?
As for local authorities, history is repeated at each closure of post, maternity, hospital, and casern.
But everyone is for savings, of course.
It’s weird, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and doesn’t enjoy the savings made in public expenses.
This article is really the most annoying thing I’ve ever read!
This embarrassing moment when the first three people who comment do the same wrong joke.
It’s the depression of scrolling his Facebook thread and seeing that 80% of his friends started their status with the phrase “This embarrassing moment.”
I think they're going to make a movie.
He will surely be based on funny scenes where someone falls by chance on his ex in the bus going to work and only realizes that his jump is back in his pants.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely stupid.
Not really, according to me, the author adopts the role of the typical British man whom we have always learned how to enclose his emotions and strike his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will have the rights?
I don’t have the “internet”.
So I don’t think I can comment.
Not having a computer.
God, I have to watch this film before I die.
I can't believe how incredible this article is the most incredible thing I've ever read!
Charlie has just demonstrated that he is all at the top of the cosmic universe that is satiric journalism!
I'm going to turn it down!
I absolutely need to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so they finally have illumination and discover the incredible lightness and insurmountable genius that springes out of Mr. Brooker’s keyboard as a divine brightness.
Good God, it was really null.
Especially if they are neither women nor transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive evolution within democracies: the rise of regional policies and effective associative initiatives.
Until a new order, we confiscate ourselves the right to save our planet by states playing the tartuffs at each meeting to save the planet.
So we, citizens, decide to take things in hand.
With the Commissioner they planted with energy, all these beautiful recommendations have fled ....
Translate: Wind and solar farms are the Round points of tomorrow.
All funded by the con-tribal.
Please cease this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful to waste and in case of accident.
As long as the field is not entirely controlled, it is better to be limited to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, of course, provided that our consumption is drastically reduced.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France is in no way concerned.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity by renewable wind or PV is already more GES on other stages and above all gas, or worse of coal as in Germany, to compensate for intermittentness.
Replacement of the nuclear with renewable wind or PV would oppose the fight against CO2.
Christial I do not insult you I am a State Doctor in Physical Science 1981 more I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove lez contrary to what I said.
For what I didn't say is you who lend me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany in fact you didn't answer what I said and like all right-wing people to destroy the interlocutor I never do it.
I also cite the conclusion of experts entrusted by the German Government: the current German Renewable Energy Programme is an inefficient and inefficient way to reduce GSE emissions and should be stopped.
0 emission if you do not count uranium extraction and construction and if you do not count greenhouse gas vapor of less effect than Co2 it is true to recall two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant parts in water vapor and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a “South Asian Giant”!!
The last time Pakistan won against Hindustan.
I don’t surprise, most Indians who post feedback want to read and make feedback only on articles against Pakistan.
In fact, it shows your state of mind well.
It would have been like if they had called India a giant of South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would just be opening a box of Pandora full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, the Kolkata Athletico stands 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a lot of way to do.
Compared to the billions and billions India devotes to the cricket of IPL and now to football, how could we one day compete with our “noisy neighbors”?
The low cost launcher race is paid cash.
Shame for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the eventual lack of design only manifests with a too cold helium.
Therefore, we may not be in a design defect, but in implementation...
Unlike arianspace which is a private society, it seems like soyouz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer.
They may be going to pay the satellites in fregates who knows.
This is all the more ugly that many media take over the only article titles - and many readers only retain these titles.
In total, this creates an incorrect impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Entirely agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly challenges the project while it is only a launcher problem.
