Republican strategy to counter Obama’s reelection
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers the latter a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
The Republican lawyers have only identified 300 cases of election fraud in the U.S. in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for holding federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments enacted new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon increased after the November 2010 elections, which added 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
Consequently, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 States were introduced in the only year of 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo identity card and proof of American citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws also reduce voting periods in advance, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the vote, and withdraw citizens with a judicial record their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo identity card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a requirement.
In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
The Republican authorities urged to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo identity card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people in the age of voting, have no photo identity cards issued by a government agency in their state.
Furthermore, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a ID.
It often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required ID card with photography.
A lot more.
Students, voters considered to vote more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their ID card with photo issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states authorize members of the fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws demanding voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish vote.
There are two out of three Spanish voters that promote the Democratic Party.
In 2011, Republican legislators sponsored laws abolishing voters on the day of voting in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of people and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to recording about 10 million citizens.
However, measures taken since 2009 have dropped the registration rate of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
Furthermore, Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the voting period in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while they represented only 13% of state voters.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
They represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, whites who formed 76% of voters represented only 46% of voters voting in advance.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetos of the Democratic Governors.
The U.S. Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to reduce the damage in part.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have adopted laws requesting the presentation of a photo identity card.
Nevertheless, the new rules implemented will undoubtedly make the exercise of voting rights more difficult in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the supporting nature of the laws that have been voted and they see an obvious goal of influencing the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Centre demonstrates that the States that adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes necessary for the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to make sure that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: go through the test or not?
Indeed, the APS test would sometimes present misresults, with false negative results or false positive results, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
What to make men already reluctant to do screening tests even more hesitant.
Do you pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination among the test groups, so it is difficult to interpret such data and to have strong recommendations.
Another European study concluded a difference in mortality between patients who had a screening and those who did not.
This study also demonstrated, with a follow-up after 12 years, that we have between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if we are not screened.
So I recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40, if you have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at greater risk.
The key is to make the right decision once you have detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others who are indolent.
It is truly necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him the possible options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and rather opting, in these cases, for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We're going to suggest them to make active monitoring and if the disease is progressing, we're going to offer them treatment.
Increasingly, criteria are accurately determined to decide who should or should not be treated.
Therefore, I still recommend that you pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether we should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to assess for and against the APS test.

Preventing illness
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress in research, adopting good life habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone was eating well and moving enough, 30% of cancer could be prevented.
“If no one was smoking anymore, this rate would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Many are also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarettes are related to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
This is a lot of harm to the health of people.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," spokesman André Beaulieu regrets.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer falls half.
Weight
Embossing and obesity also promote the appearance of the disease, according to the SCC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“The research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer,” he added.
The Food
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too large amounts, it increases the risk of having a colorectal cancer.
Carcasses also, and they should be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying, or sale can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"These latter can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," it is explained.
Vitamins
Over the past few years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at the moment.
Vitamin E studies are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While one of them found a decreased risk of prostate cancer, another rather noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established either.
Furthermore, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking about his concerns and his family history with his doctor.
"Passing a screening test doesn't give cancer."
The Boson of Higgs Cut
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs' boson created a whole fear, last summer, and for reason.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, nothing but that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of the matter - but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it's not completely sure that it's Higgs.
It is known without a doubt that a genuine new particle is held, and that it resembles a lot the boson of Higgs predicted by the Standard Model.
Furthermore, new data disclosed this week at a large physics congress in Kyoto seems to confirm it, but there is still lack of data to be perfectly certain.
Let’s assume whether it’s right about Higgs, since the chances of misleading seem thin, and let’s see what it’s about.
There is, in this lower world, a fatally indispensable law that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to violate this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
But even though the physics of particles is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has such a law: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - that "state" consisting grosso in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify the particles into two categories.
In one corner there are good citizens named fermions, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And in the other, the bosons are stirring, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means they can be at the same place at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not approach here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature spread and to which the boson of Higgs would somehow be related.
These bosons, we must point out here, are not all as exotic beasts as we might believe.
In fact, if you are able to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" which is the "messager" of electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle having an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it "distrakes" the electromagnetic field at this specific location, a little like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "disorder" is born an electromagnetic wave (of light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore, one of the "force carriers" bosons.
More stable field
The same is true with Higgs' boson, in this difference that it is another field, the Higgs' field, which must be "deranged" for that boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, we have to reach very, very high energy, somewhat as if it was a frozen pond that only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That’s why we need a huge particle accelerator like that of the CERN – the Large Hadron Collider is a 27-km ring of circumference! – to reach such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the ratio between the Higgs and the mass.
Indeed, not all particles, nor all materials, interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold on a refrigerator.
And in the same way, it is not all particles that interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the others (like photon, yours) do not have it.
Now, what can “bear” all of these researches, asks Ms. Plamondon?
For science, it is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to check any difference between observations and predictions of the MS.
Moreover, they are several to wish heavily to find it, because the least difference could open a door to a "new physical" and buckle some holes in the Model.
This, it must be said, still has huge deficiencies, offering no explanation for the gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (re-ups!).
But we haven't found such differences in the CERN so far.
Repercussions
The consequences of these researches in the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. All-Monde, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be none.
In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in the Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work would trigger.
They were using scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 - initially the laser was rather seen as a "laboratory gadget".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his optical work.
This sensor, although it was not at all its original intention, now serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras in the world, and he won the Nobel Prize of Physics 2009.
This, of course, doesn’t mean that LHC’s activities will necessarily change our lives, but that means that, really, we never know...
Palliative Care - The Best Way to Die... | The Duty
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed soon as a bill is prepared.
But in this essential field, a lot remains to be done.
The duty tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that roasted him had left him a two-year rest.
"They had given me five years to live, I was seven years old," he said, half-raisin figue, lying in his bed at the palliative care house Victor-Gadbois, from Beloeil, where he arrived on the previous day.
“But it’s always a shock, we can’t be prepared for that,” he says.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents her from going alone to the toilet, and even eating alone.
Set in front of an appetizing lunch, he agrees to leave himself helping to eat, resigned.
Bold, he even smiles, speaks to strangers who are about him, bring his medications to him, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to be healed from diarrhea, it's humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for this illness.
“In our lifetime, we learn that a man is pishing up,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Returning to the child’s stage, for some people, is unacceptable humiliation.
“It depends on the person’s ability to accept regression,” he says.
For, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments take place in the heart of this regression.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care house all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life forecast of three months.
At this stage, the "team of doctors and nurses that surround them" no longer provides so-called "healing care".
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "conscious and suffocated."
But the disease made me discover my children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
"I no longer have any wishes in life," she says, before accepting that we put a mask on her to help her breathe.
In the next few days, she expects a last visit from her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers is provided with body care and food assistance.
It is palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when we know we all die one day.
Here, life continues under the best conditions possible, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the house.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When you die, you will agree to provide mouth care to brandy or Pepsi, according to the request.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar rates.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died overnight.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help relatives as much as patients,” says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
At the house Victor-Gadbois, the days follow but do not resemble each other.
Alongside a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last family assembly in the courtyard, quietly in his pillows while drinking in his honor, a 36-year-old man dies tragicly, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there are always three to five beds that are occupied by cancers under the age of 45," Dr. Christiane Martel said.
53% of patients who are admitted to Victor-Gadbois come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply don’t have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to relieve suffering when a sick has reached the end phase of his life, whether at home, at the hospital or at the care house.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois house and the Grand Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in care for cancers.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Québec health care that fears several doctors specialized in palliative care the adoption of a law involving euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by summaries of palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to witness their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not sufficiently effective to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before we agree to proceed with euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spending 14 days of emergency, in great pain, without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients are asking to die only because they don't get the appropriate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists struggle on their patients until the last day, despite the worst forecasts.
Helena Richard's hopes of survival were already minimal when she abandoned an attempting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist I stopped treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she told.
Yet she told me that I'm finished!
No all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for not accessing their request after they were relieved from their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Director of Palliative Care at the Grand Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, patients would be refractory to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors then often use palliative sedation, which is to sleep the patient until the time of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer suppose not to hear that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to euthanasize me,” that means “I want to be relieved.”
The reporting was made possible through a journalism scholarship of the Canadian Health Research Institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP entrepreneurs, political parties fund collectors, and Italian mafia specialists tell every day what they know about a tremendous "system", mixing building industry, officials, politicians, unionists and mafiaists.
A " industry " which cost Quebec taxpayers very expensively, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious as the system is scared since we've taken the great means," Jacques Duchesneau, a MP in Quebec and former chief of police in Montreal, ironized.
It was by him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a substantial investigation on roadwork contracts related to roadworks in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister Jean Charest had only consented to retreat.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, occult financing of parties and official corruption.
“Since the start of the 2010 investigation, the only Ministry of Transport would have saved a billion dollars on contracts,” he said, “some referring to their instincts to touch a quote!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he adds, hoping it will be able to "demonstrate the stratagems behind individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-corruption Unit, established in 2011, also addresses it with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
The more the "Marteau Squad" police officers who, since 2009, have led Montreal's "waste cartel" to put the soft pedal on contract swellings...
In recent weeks, she has conducted series searches and carried charges for fraud and corruption against municipal elects, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city in the outskirts.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has recently resigned from his position as Mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third city.
He is suspected of having repeated pots in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers are also formally accused on the route of Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter made sense by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who returned the money to Union Montreal, Mayor Gérald Tremblay’s party.
Mr. Zambito sowed all winds in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to liberals at the time.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal collection of funds for former Liberal Vice Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Waste Contracts He Increased Costs
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked round.
Gilles Surprising, a former engineer in public work, detailed it before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and winning pots totaling $736,000, in exchange for sewage contracts he inflated costs.
Other road officials have admitted that they have fatted their legs by swelling 30% to 40% the invoices, by fake extras.
Then an organizer of the Mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closed his eyes to a parallel budget feeding his boxes with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, diving Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal’s first elected to shoot the alarm sound.
Mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, east of the island, started in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land purchased $5 million and resold... 1.6 million to promoters, in real estate boom.
70% dirt money in electoral campaigns
From the investigation that will ultimately be put in place, she says she "shows on a wire to understand how the system operates, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pick up the faults."
The process, she says, is "painful but positive."
We're cleaning the wound, but we'd need a clean investigation unit in Montreal and a sightseeing unit, so that we don't see the doubtful practices return.
Just like cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes on his side that “officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,” but is especially concerned about the role of “elected to know about the stratagem,” when they didn’t immerse themselves in the magic!
Estimating 70% of the share of dirty money in financing electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironizes: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit the donations to $100 to the parties, but it won’t change it, he says, “Until strictly limited electoral expenditure, there will be dirty money in politics.”
He advocates a comprehensive revision of the system of granting public contracts and financing of the parties: "We cannot go lower; going to the depth of things, with courage, will enable the house to rebuild on stronger bases, with more controls and laws."
If this story tenders the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look at their own court...
“The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!”
This season, you took a new scale with the PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players arrived.
Every day I progress on their side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
Every day, these elements push me to rise my level of game.
And in the match, it is easier.
Everything goes quickly in the football.
But I don't burn myself.
From my debut to the preforming center of the INF Clairefontaine to my passage in Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by stairs.
So you benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
The recruits of this summer are used to playing high-level matches.
They also know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to deal with and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my positioning.
He is scattered by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Yeah, of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect in all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won a lot of titles with hupped clubs.
He was together with great players.
I think he will win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comfortable discussion with him.
I was going out of a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my performance.
What do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the place of leadership.
But we remain in a buscade.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have qualified ourselves for the 8th final with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We're gonna try to go as far as possible.
Now everything can happen.
But we will have our word to say in front of very good European teams.
First we want to finish first of our chicken, in front of Porto, to be able to receive at the 8th final return.
Can the PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and register over time.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG gives itself the means for this project to be implemented.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, we’re really looking forward to playing this champion title.
Last season, we didn’t go far away.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to end first.
We've been a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we are supposed to be a champion.
But another team, Montpellier, made an even more fantastic season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even though big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win it.
Do you think the media is expecting too much from the PSG?
It is normal that many of us are expected in view of what has been invested and the players we have.
We accept it completely.
Afterwards, when you win 4-0 at home against Troyes and still find things to blame us, it's sure it's a little frustrating.
We wonder what people expect more.
We will never be able to win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not the FC Barcelona.
We are trying to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we could answer presents.
Look at Manchester City that hasn’t come to qualify for the 8th final for two seasons, they’ve also made huge expenses!
With regard to the amounts invested, you were imagined with 15 points in advance to the treat!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Liga 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can have the smile by telling ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we eventually won it.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Better to say there's a "Zlatan addiction."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very effective and he puts a lot of goals.
He came for this and he proves that he is the star of the League 1.
He demonstrated everywhere he went through that he was a great player, a world star.
In the group, man and player are respected.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did is really exceptional.
This drives others to rise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I was very happy to participate in this euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grabbing playing time.
I saw some things there, and I got reinforced.
Today, I’m able to make good matches in selection.
That's what I had hoped since my baptism with the Blues.
We learned the lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and we have to have an exemplary behaviour today.
What do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He has the results for himself.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires it to win.
Just like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved its goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will drive the Blues to Brazil.
Is the zero good (1-1) drawn on 16 October in Spain a founding match?
This match gave us trust.
Everyone fighted for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I never had a game like that in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The entire opposite of current monetary exchanges based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Furthermore, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made of bank monopoles, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from pairs to pairs.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded with 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a payment means.
The bitcoin price, after reaching a summit of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today around a dozen dollars (the courses are identified on the bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing very impressive, compared to global exchanges in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin distinguishes from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to progress in a video game that you earn by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this type of system.
But every time a central authority controls and treats trade.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are both depositors of the book of accounts, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually done between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the file content, it is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public account book, broadcast throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched on computers, and the winner of which, as a provisional central bank, will have the privilege to add this additional line.
This is a file hacking phase, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers "start" the new transaction and add a number to it before "hacking" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (lots of zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any changes would change the footprint.
If, to fraud, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan because both have different footprints.
The computer solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are dividible until the one hundred millionth, leaving the margin.
The difficulty of the challenge is also highlighted at each increase in computational power.
The network's life has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
“The failure used does not concern the protocol itself,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
Cash also has this defect.
Actors like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this kind.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the accountbook and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "gigant soldiers" were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a teaching book on this currency, believes a lot in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a non-contact mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus return cheaper.
The carrier further manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
Just give them an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who assures that thousands of users have.
There is a general questioning movement of hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
“It will take time for Bitcoin to take itself, but 2013 could be a turn,” he predicted.
In its report, the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, today considered high, in the event of successful currency.
We left Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their responsibility zone in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and Americans are expected to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future without expecting everything from us.
It is above all Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign armed presence, such as the times of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks, and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes helped by local insurgents, they will no longer be tolerated when the Westerns become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted from almonds thanks to French credits, was done in order.
Trucks and armoured convoys joined Kabul without being attacked, flew over helicopters.
There will be no Taliban drop on Kabul at the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country of fire and blood due to struggles between different factions.
Their control of the country had then been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants exceeded by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Ancient Mudjahidin, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main majors of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They moved into affairists, grabbing government lands to sell them back into lands to build to refugees income from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They disconsidered themselves; most of them have not fought themselves.
People, as I heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will leave those who have been able to enjoy American widespreads: the leakage of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They joined the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they enjoyed the benefits of it.
About 65% of the population is under 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full, girls like boys.
It will need to provide work to those young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are friendly of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish sheets that have a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about reconstructing provincial militias, which will escape the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization, like the image of the Western nations, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized, strong presidential state, removing the position of Prime Minister that existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled in April 2014.
But his country has been, since the 1950s and long before, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been restored, no dam is in state, no important irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left on the private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had immense mining wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the Westerns were only there to take it.
Without energy to process iron or copper ore on site, or transport means to export it through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have already almost left My Aynak’s copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) searching the immense Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province.
It will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal reports.
The departure of the French fighter troops ended on November 20.
The new Cooperation Treaty provides for the pursuit of traditional aid: high school of girls, boys, department of French at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, to attempt to "win the hearts and spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of coinciding with offensive aids and actions, a "civil-military action" service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), removed in 2012, has conducted, and conducted by a small French mountain NGOs, many of collective interest and rehabilitation actions.
These works, gourmets in local workforce, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, rewooding, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in cultivable surfaces.
What will we leave as a memory after two billion euros of military expenditure?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very tough in these valleys often at more than 2,000 meters of altitude.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to release themselves from the insurrection conducted by foreign groups, what farmers told me to wish, they should maintain a small, well-controlled civilian aid in their favour and which touch them directly.
A Constitution with the Forceps in Egypt
It's a new poker shot by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional statement, which temporarily gives it full powers, he decided to play his go-to-go.
He announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted the House two more months to finish its work.
For soon two years, Egypt relied on a provisional text, which several times amended what fragilizes institutional stability and leads to legal impetus.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the President continues in his "autocratic deliberation", continuing to "remove his word" and "spoeling the right."
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible, accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to renounce their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, this is also a way to find a popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute is raging throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favorably, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Especially because this recourse to a precipitate vote lies from the ultimatum of the Egyptian people: "Whether you vote for my text or I keep full powers," they supposedly end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, with a vast Islamic majority, voted the text yesterday.
Most liberals lacked the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional statement, they had closed the door, estimating that they could not make their views apply.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be achieved, 11 people, replacement members, have been added in a hurry, yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
No surprise, it is most often that the articles have been voted unanimously.
Furthermore, commentators have fun that one of the only differences of the day had expressed itself around... the time of prayer, some members of the committee believe that the pendulum of the constituent was wrongly settled.
The text, which was still being voted last night, contains 234 articles.
Article 2 remains the same as the Constitution of 1971, stipulating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed a more strict enforcement.
For Islamists, the fact that this article was not modified is a guarantee of their good will and respect for other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," the liberals answer, who only see a blow of communication.
For they believe that the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They aim in particular article 220, which gives the Al-Azhar University an advisory role, particularly in verifying the compliance of laws with sharia.
According to Egypt’s specialist Sophie Pommier, it is worrying because “the people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
There can be seen the beginnings of a theocracy.”
The fears of liberals are also attracted by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current.
"For the present time, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain in the framework of the civilian state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not olemas, but academics, for some trained in the French system," tempers Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be an ambiguity around article 220, because the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
It refers to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And in the future, the question might be to know how far civilian judges are competent to judge themselves.”
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is very criticized because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers conferred to the army.
In accordance with the military's desire, the review of the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Not more than civilian trials in military courts will be prohibited, as the human rights associations requested.
The latter also express their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticidal.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and the offence of blasphemy is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, including the press.
Furthermore, no articles are echoed to women's protection, says Heba Morayef, Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by article 36.
The word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, protests were planned this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will go on them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the Center of the World and a salmon sea await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort and wild nature.
Argoumenty i Fakty has chosen five great reasons to go to Israel.
Go to love the holy places
See you indispensable: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these "Baptism Funds" will be touched by Divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked over the water, where he soothed the storm, or where the fishing was miraculous.
It is in this specific place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
The believers travel the street of the suffering or the path to Cross (in Latin: the Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the pretorium), where the trial was held, then led through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Stone of the Once and of the Sepulchre.
Here is the Christian center of the world, a symbol of the salvation of mankind.
According to the Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected to the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew up.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave little words accompanied by prayers which are then heard.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the fortress Massada, ancient refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 B.C. for his family.
These ruins are located on the abrupt rocks of a mountain at 450 m above the sea level.
Only lovers of alpinism can get there by their own means.
For others, a cable car takes them to this full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m high, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont which welcomes many tourists in the winter.
A shuttle can drive you from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods to live on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country houses nearly 300 museums.
It was not possible to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth the turn.
First: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (parliament).
It is home to the very ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Desert of Judea, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
Also to see: Tel Aviv Art Museum.
There are mainly the paintings of the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of mouldings of visitors and supervisors of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures of Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Entry is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Museum of the Holocaust or Memorial of Yad Vashem, located in Tel Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the children's memory, built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into a total darkness.
Stars shine.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Health and well-being
The three major seaside resorts of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, aquatic parks, delphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, as the temperature of the water does not fall below 21° while that of the air can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
Above all, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, 417 m below the sea level.
Blue-colored water contains salt and retains swimmers very easily, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes surrounding it are of a surrealistic beauty.
There is a treatment based on salt water, lemon, healing sludge and to cure different diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, but also simply relax.
Discover the secrets of ancient times
They are kept by the old town of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the Greek and Egyptian legends of ancient times.
According to the legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists especially like to walk in the narrow streets that carry the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, the fate will smile to you.
In Jaffa you will be able to meet young brides who have come to take photo sessions from all of Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk into the Roman theatre, "conquer" the fortress of the crosses.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to tourists
If you’re going to Israel, don’t worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro because they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar equals 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, they are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the country’s only metro line, consisting of six stations and capable of connecting the low and high parts of the city.
It is almost a underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transportation costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cease their activity.
And the work week begins on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only as a kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, stainless fish and dishes composed of both milk and meat.
There is a wide range of lamb and beef-based dishes, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also the humous, traditional Jewish pasta, different sauces, mould chick peas balls, falafels, fruit and vegetables.
There are no walking dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are a lot of well-fed cats that walk the high-speaking air.
You can see them sleep at night on the roofs of parked cars.
These felins love passing places and don't refuse to get them.
The rental of a car varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entry to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The Language of the Numbers
Three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mostly people coming to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists travelled to the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Who Language Has, Goes to Moscow": Migrants Save Money To Learn Language
While MPs and human rights activists are controversial about what will be given by the law on compulsory linguistic test, frauders who sell "fake" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families staying at home.
Since December 1, a law has entered into force and stipulates that each migrant worker will have to take a Russian language exam.
For the moment, this rule only relates to those who intend to work in the service, housing, services to individuals and retail sector.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, the knowledge of the language, but also the knowledge of the history of Russia and the foundations of law, will need to be validated.
It will need to validate his language knowledge in Russian to obtain and renew his work permit.
Only nationals of the countries where Russian has the status of official language are exempt.
Persons who received certificates or degrees prior to the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 are also not affected by this law.
Profit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centers will be under the guidance of the Russian Language Institute Pouchkin, the University of Peoples' Friendship, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St. Petersburg and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to spend examinations in all cities of the country: more than 160 centers have already been opened throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by Members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what will it do?
What is the obligation to know Russian will change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service respond, this will reduce the number of people suffering "from slavery to work".
Many talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the Russian Federal Migration Service Office in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of the rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve foreign workers’ problems at 90%.
The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev certified, the future migrant is intended to meet dishonest people who, on the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" to an overpopular house where he and dozens of his friends will torture for months without food and without paper and will need to cut between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
“One thing is promised to them, and when they arrive, we deceive them, we take their passport, and they don’t touch the planned salary,” confirms Chief Migration Services Officer for the work of Tajikistan’s migration service, Tolib Charipov.
Don't fight me, Mr. Policeman!
However, many citizens of Central Asian republics who wish to come to earn money in Russia are confident that they do not only know the language of the country they wish to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is of course not their fault, but their misery: few of Turkmenisms, Uzbeks, Tajiks can allow themselves to follow only a passable primary teaching.
Indeed, their families don’t even have to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equiping them for school.
As soon as they arrive in the teenage age, these young people are going to make money as soon as the opportunity appears.
It’s hard when you don’t know the language, they trust.
"You feel decreased and decreased."
Human rights defenders, however, note an important aspect of the language law.
Examinations will be intended only for migrants who have legal status.
Without status, there will be no official review or work subsequently.
However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or Defense to Enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The administrative barriers and these linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 miles.
And then, you can get a fake recording quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
Russian police officers know that we have false documents, that we don't have records, hence the cases of extortion.
"They ask us about 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," reported Umed Khouchkadamov, a Tajikistan national.
"Do quickly, don't let go, and buy yourself a nice work of art."
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was discovered that migrant registration papers were not the only ones to be false.
Several fake language examination certificates have already been confiscated by federal migration department employees.
False papers come out of a regular color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: every migrant who hoped to make it easier for the exams had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is twice and a half more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Representatives of power and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply purchase these "paper bits".
Authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination from the first step the time to follow language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian language will be proposed work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of Interior does not take care of the weapons market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of Interior proposes to strengthen the law against civilian weapons.
This is the response of the authorities to recent incidents: whether they were shootings at marriages or killings organized by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who made seven deaths.
The police aim to ban rubber bullet weapons in public places and raise the legal age of obtaining the arms carrier license by making it grow from 18 to 21 years old.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced to the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is happy to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "locking the screw."
An open letter appeared on the Internet in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demand to give up “this insane hardening.”
The percentage of crimes committed with a recorded weapon is minimal, said Vasiliy Lesnikov, a BBC crime specialist and legalist.
According to the Ministry of Interior statistics, over a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in police offices while 1,168,000 crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that strengthening civilian weapons laws will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market.
According to them, any weapon can be found in Moscow today for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of Interior states that it controls the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black weapons market is provided via several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served ten years at the Ministry of Education and the Quarter-General.
Screenshot drawn from a site taking weapons commands
The first is "the military trace," i.e. the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," Baranets said.
The second type of weapons coming from the black market are those stolen by criminals from the law enforcement forces.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen in police stocks and weapons stolen directly from the representatives of the police forces.
Illegal guns leave for sale from military warehouses.
Many of these have often suffered explosions.
“Attestated versions indicate that some fires have been deliberately triggered to hide the deficit,” the former military said.
For Baranets, the weapons manufacturers are there for something.
“We see private weapons plants that do not rival competition in the international market and flow weapons in the black market, especially in Moscow,” a expert says.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A significant portion of guns and machinery comes from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
“We find a local, sometimes artisanal production, a mafia has formed and organized the supply,” the former military adds.
Where's the weapons from?
Experts evaluated the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public weapon portal data.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers explain, comes from the army and law enforcement forces.
Half of the weapons in the black market has been found there "because of the lack of employees whose work is linked to weapons," the report said.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacturing and 5% are from "clandestine weapons".
A seller and consultant of an armature who asked to keep anonymity ensures that nobody has long been buying the weapons found by these clandestine search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, he says, sellers will search for new goods in military warehouses.
The person buys a unit through a teacher, for example a TT gun.
It is given to him by passing the goods through a grid.
“He transports it to town and sells it for 900 € per unit with two chargers,” he says.
"It is true that the police is aware of all affairs, so when crimes are about to be elucidated, it makes a control purchase from illegal weapons merchants," the seller adds.
" Like in a luxury shop "
The seller and buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I visited sites, blogs, until a guy manifested and proposed me to come to the Begovaya station where someone became taking me to a "coin" to market.
The price of the gun, I was given on site
Victor Baranets as Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, the seller explains. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers in the markets, but there we must also come there by saying, for example, "From such a person, who asked me to convey that his daughter has lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of American handles using a person I trust.
He gives them to me only because he knows I won't give it.
The little new ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, he says, have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which there was “all that we want.”
“I thought I was in a luxury shop,” the military recalls.
There is no secret for the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, we're going with the forest seller and installing a target.
“They let me shoot and when I am convinced that the weapon works well, we begin to negotiate,” the expert describes.
A shop from his sofa
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
To do this, we don’t need any documents and anyone to meet.
"Just have a precise amount of money," advertising is written on the site "Buy a gun or a fighting mitraillet."
Users leave their request there and ask their questions.
And we're selling to minors?
"Without permit, of course," the user asks "Ivan" (retained orthograph).
"Acquire TT. Moscow," writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast a huge network of fake sites and gathers the people wishing to purchase fighter weapons.
People run on food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia

I heard of this type of schemes: usually, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment on automatic terminals.
"He in return receives a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," says the secretary of the association "Right to a weapon," Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that by making a request on the site, you can find yourself without a gun and behind the bars.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast a huge network of fake sites and gathers the people wishing to purchase fighter weapons.
“People run on food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia,” he said.
A Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal gun, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the Association "The Right to a Weapon," one can buy a Makarov gun for $100-300.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
It was released from long-term warehouses by the direction of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official data from the department, compared to January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7% and is 22.9 miles, while cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
U.S.: Employees of fast food and supermarkets are in strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through cashwork at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against the low wages performed by the Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict whether this wave is going to expand or breathe quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
Along with the rise in modest wages perceived by basic employees at Walmart and in fast-food chains, organizers of the events wish to obtain the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The demonstrations began last week, after Thanksgiving, "Black Friday", at the time that a rain of balances seized millions of inhabitants dropped over America and sometimes triggered scrapers.
On that day, some employees of the Walmart company, employing 2.2 million people around the world, left their job to organize strike pickets with unions and left activists in the stores of the company whose products are intended for consumers of modest and medium-sized classes.
Walmart markets everything: from layers to hunting guns to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products there are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in major supermarkets.
This is why many poorly paid employees at Walmart do their races only at their workplace.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to criticism, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products, especially due to the low wages of its employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of lift trucks or portable scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" demonstrations requested a salary increase, they complained that the company's medical insurance price had increased by $30 to $100 per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who hits $9.5 per hour, it is a sum he cannot afford.
Scientists from the California University of Berkley demonstrate that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 per hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
This is 1.1% more than it is currently spending.
If Walmart transferred all the increase in wages on the shoulders of consumers, each race in the store would be 46 cents more.
They will spend $12.39 more in a year than now.
Walmart’s supporters noticed with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did not harm the group.
"Black Friday" continued in stores from 8am to midnight the next day and Walmart sold over this period 5000 items in the second.
His boxes have carried out 100 million transactions for the "black Friday".
Spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview at Huffington Post’s left-wing site that Walmart’s “fewer than five” employees had left their positions and that the protest was only a “com-operation among many others” from the organizing union.
"Next client!"
The protests continued this week in New York and also concerned Walmart stores (in this progressive city they are not very appreciated, that’s why they’re not yet in place) but McDonald’s and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s announces selling billions of portions and afterwards they don’t even give you a sick leave and don’t pay you the job you’ve done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum salary provided by federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Fast foods increase over time, but little, its basic employees average touch New York $8.90 per hour.
No one touchs less than them in this city.
It is unthinkable for me to live with this money in New York.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I am interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with them.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum you find comments saying it is irresponsible to make children if you don’t know what you’re going to feed them with.
Demonstrators who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 near McDonald’s on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue required cassiers and fast-food cookers to be paid at least $15 per hour, a multiplication more than twice than the current minimum wage.
They also asked for the creation of trade unions in the fast food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration of obstacling and punishing the protesters of a union by brimade or dismissals.
However, the administration rarely simplifies their life.
For a union, taking fast food remains a difficult task, and for concrete reasons.
One of the main is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They do not agree
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held near several other fast food chains.
The main moment of the protest was the gathering in the middle of the day near McDonald's of Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic policies, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the municipal council, who said, "McDonald's announced selling billions of portions and afterwards they don't even give you a sickle leave!
The protesters have been supported by other New York Democrats in view, especially by Mayor candidate Bill De Blasio who said that “we must all support fast food employees in order to obtain a fair salary and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times has characterized this manifestation as the most important that the fast food sector has been known throughout its history.
But only a few hundred people participated without counting that not all were fast-food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is difficult for the moment to say whether this mass movement flashlight will make little ones.
"For the moment, we just get medium deceived the brain."
Recently, fans of new technologies have been used to perceiving augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, Google unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had filed the patent application.
However, from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group of the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, it shows that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already of ancient history.
They are tempted by the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the nude-hand air, by creating open virtual spaces.
Could you tell us in a few words what your research group does?
- We work on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time try to expand the borders of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained at the pixels on flat screen and sometimes at the touch.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead of us and guess what radical changes will happen with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in command by gesture.
- What does the future also reserve us?
Although Kinect has made physical interaction, a lot of things happen on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information entry has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance, for now, not really.
We are trying to change this and we are working on 3D imaging systems working on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out of ours, in the physical world, to make it more touchable.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Thus, we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more convenient form.
And to begin with, let’s get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of the voice command?
It is appreciated, but isn’t it overestimated?
It cannot be said that this is the panacea: the privacy issue arises because we don’t always want to inform others about their actions or intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in his niche.
For instance, to order the equipment in public places, we had a project that we thought we thought about gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discrete, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- I mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this can?
You would do it with the word and with the gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt depending on what the machine can or cannot do at a given time?
- Not necessarily, but this is a mutual approach.
I think very soon we will have to work to develop new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they produce quite good resolution in depth and it is very important.
- If you're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what doesn't you like in modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we are based on our work on 3D recognition.
It would be obviously good to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this latter point, all current technologies are quite good, this adds work to algorithm designers.
Resolution according to the X and Y axis must be kept in mind, but also Z.
Speed also imports a lot, the number of frames in the second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s really are not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche from our Redmond laboratory gave the touch of sensors a regular treatment delay between 1 and 100 μs, current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would need such a device in my work, but I would not need to touch, to have more frames in the second.
- But shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a reflected signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a usual sensor of the visible field.
It does not use to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or worse it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, to play with the curve of cameras, and to see how it could help set locations.
As long as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from a perspective of daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most prospective platforms?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone your hands lifted is not convenient, but this is what I think: the best option would be a "transitory" augmented reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass glasses to the smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal device and that’s what makes their strength (the personal elements are those you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with others.
- Imagine a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is only accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to simple mortal.
There is a problem on which opponents to this idea point to the finger: there is no touch feeling!
The hands feel nothing!
What answers do your group prepare for this challenge?
In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could be the adding touch sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as a picture support.
It perfectly records the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are actually intended to attribute palpability to these "pictures in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed towards a precise point where the finger is located and that gives you the sensation, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the fingers.
There are also the bracelets worn on the wrists that influence the nervous ends of the fingers, they are also a working axis with prospects.
- And you tried to cheat the brain?
Make him believe he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There is still one task below that it will take a long time to hurt: how to make someone who is physically in a very small space he walks in an almost infinite open space - we work on the concepts of racing carpets (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, the brain is only medium deceiving, there are still many years of work.
This is what makes work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "L'Avant-garde pétersbourgeois" dedicated to citizens who are in advance, in the avant-garde of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed outstanding actors from the artistic scene of St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the border of the city and who have found recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravert painter Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, this rather beard man, all in red dress that can be crossed near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or in the festivities and lacquers.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always gather crowds, regardless of their place of exhibition.
He is one of the landly social and philosophical Petersbourgeois contenders, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is an eminent representative of the Petersbourgeois avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and put them in good mood.
He recently took a Barbarian organ in his hands and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had mature enough for this difficult role of his existence, philosophy and image of Bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you travel the city in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose the red as a cushion specializing in the appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even though in society, everything that is not grey causes aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you understand that you should be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my work was located.
I realized that it was my way.
Then, the wave of the old unofficial painters had passed past and the new, free, in my kind, were incomprehensive.
I began to tie friendship with the painters of the new wave, with those of Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no wave anymore.
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to be at the center of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces must come together.
In 1995, I took place at Pouchkinskaya-10, which was home to a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the Bohemian Petersbourgeois.
Many were born there: The Names, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "Van Gogh's ear".
Chnour and his friends were singing easy playback songs in moulding suits, they were among them Igor Vdovin, fashion composer today.
When the band began to happen live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg lived a lot of shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg, and it was then that his great career began, but his basic training and education, he received them at our home.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboyedov": these are the impacts of the artistic clinic.
Our employees have gone there as used.
I am a hero from the past century, from the time that culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the "The Personalities of Our City" award.
I was named "Painting of the Year," and it was then that my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong news and acuity.
I will have a programmed exhibition "The Russian Museum Through Clowns".
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it's afraid to be like that.
But with the clowns, everything goes away, the tragic falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through complete and mandatory dressing.
Today, it's the clothes that matter, you're interested in the outside mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give her hand, but rather we need to screw her in the trunk.
And the lie will be deleted by the dress.
- Recently we've seen you in the role of Barbarian organ player. - A cultural city must have such a hero.
Who else than I can play it?
- But maybe commercial art can be beautiful too?
- Today commercial art must be taken care of, delicate, liquorious.
A disintegration of culture is now taking place.
Before, people were shared into herds, the supporters of the Bohemians loved one thing, the nick one another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 banknote to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each speaker has 100 fans.
- But thousands of people come to Stas Mikhailov!
- They're people we thrown to see him. It's the sexual and social side that walks.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come, and in the end, it is less management, money, everything destroys.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to destroy the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hanged next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually those we painted at the end of my life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is spiritual culture, consumption culture.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money just for painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in Saint Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the reign of good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand the culture well, but they understood that the good experts should be kept.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who might be experts, but they are deviated because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and make them a path.
Currently, it’s the “reign of taste” that flourishes.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that sense that they honestly say that they do not take all the contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for this.
And on our stones, art has difficulty to grow.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious who will see exhibitions, concerts.
At our home, this layer is very fine.
We have to turn art to fashion as it was in the early century.
Project carried out with the support of the Saint Petersburg Scholarship
Accusing in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with landscapes on board are looking for an emergency planet.
To save humanity, a big question is asked: how do we continue to make our species live as weighty or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's a lot of choice.
In fact, there are two real planets that can be conquered, if only by hypothesis.
"It is Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If on Mars conditions are more suitable for life, the surface temperature of Venus is 500.
We can only live there at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to focus on matters of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were done on plants.
Four generations of small peans cultivated on orbit did not differentiate in any way from earthly varieties.
Then, we put on orbit of insects, small reproductive drosophilic flys.
In 1979, cattle eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo developed by weight.
On the outlet we get a quite normal chicken.
Then the problems start.
“The problem is related to the fact that the puppy has to find a support, he has to put on his legs and start moving,” says Vladimir Sychev, director of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When they found no support, the chickens were disordained.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts entirely atrophize.
The chickens did not react either to the light or to the sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
“We’ve broken their eyes twice and then abandoned, because it’s simply impossible to work with them there,” says Vladimir Sychev, seeing the failure of the experience with the chickens in space.
The last biological "miniature arch" with animals was sent to orbit 16 years ago.
Experiences will continue in spring 2013.
However, biosatellite " Bion" will only board species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetus into space.
In principle, nothing surnatural has been discovered.
"It was still biosatellites and then this is the only experience. This type of research must be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats gave birth to their descendants.
However, it is not yet possible to perform reproductions directly in space.
It's not a thin affair.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instinct.
Unlike beasts, man is in principle able to do so.
The Homo sapiens possesses abstract thought, it is capable of creating an appropriate emotional background.
This type of experience is not performed for ethical reasons.
But women have gone into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the female body is what humanity has most valuable.
Our mouette fled and no one on Earth could say if it would stand after a flight in space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
"No one answered this question," explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, a retired missile and space sector.
In June 1964, just a year after her space flight, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
Andrian Nikolayev, the father of the child, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been twice on orbit and even worked in extra-vehicle environment, was born to a son.
However, the risk continues.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have not had anything and who give birth to a fully healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it poses a danger even during orbit flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, Soviet Union hero and Russian hero, Valeriy Poliakov.
However, humanity must look for new solutions in biotechnology, protection against radiation and the creation of artificial gravitation.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Centre for Preparation of Cosmonauts: Compulsory Step of Preparation for Flight.
Here, in zero floatability, cosmonauts train to extra-vehicle outputs.
The water mimics the apessant.
If for adults, water is comfortable but however a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
Small amphibious men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby evolves about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid in her mother’s stomach, it is easier for her to then get used to water.
This is logical in principle, because from his birth until his first bath it is only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In one word, if for the child who has just been born the apessant is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, weight strength.
In thickness, the muscles of the stomach, the basin atrophicate very quickly, the baby’s push capacity is lost.
Okay, let's don't know this by relying on the birth simulators.
Of course, you can prepare a childbirth in a special room, the woman will be able to bring him out.
"What then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite him to think about this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel land attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or muscle system.
You cannot dress a baby like an adult with a special combination for training.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imaging the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a child with disabilities, who is completely disadapted," said the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still theory.
However, over time, this will become reality, when the Earth's travelling in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their descendants born in space.
The head of the ISC (Senior Institute for Public Finance Control) said: " Control of pseudo-independent work (in Czech " Švarc system ") failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is on the ground for its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the Superior Institute for Public Finance Control, said in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but its enforcement must be fair and, in my opinion, that’s what lacks in us,” Kala said in her commentary on the current situation.
A joint control conducted by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
It cites as an example of abusive practice the approach to the " Švarc system " by Petr Nečas.
Mr. Prime Minister recently stated that the SDG was not going to disturb entrepreneurs with controls; is it allowed or prohibited?
“The law must be enforced in some way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of the government cannot prevent an authority responsible for going to inspect demanding compliance with the law,” Kala said.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee in the House of Members, you mentioned a Czech-German project in which the legislation on public procurement in these two countries has been compared.
What was the concrete question?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation, as well as a so-called practice to follow it.
We have gathered all this and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have emerged to us: generally speaking, our legislation may be "more severe and better quality", nevertheless, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This therefore confirms that it is not sufficient to continuously develop more and more detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote to the implementation of the law itself.
What can this project concretely help you, and what does it result for you?
A common control of this kind should just contribute to stoping our efforts to clarify the laws, lower and improve thresholds, when it does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But in reducing the market thresholds, this goal will not necessarily be achieved.
It might be that this system is so submerged by the paperwork, that those looking for the failures will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained above.
You are talking about internal issues in the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different mode of organization?
With regard to institutions, as well as the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof operates there, which is organized similarly, it also has a council constituted a little differently, but these two institutions proceed fundamentally similarly.
Skills are also to some extent similar, with a shade however in relation to our system: Germany is a federal structure, therefore it also has such accounts at different levels.
The BRH can only control federal money, which corresponds among us to state resources.
The public funds managed by regions and municipalities are controlled there at the level of the Länder accounts.
As for national legislation, is it easier than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model, but it cannot be said to be better in all areas.
Is it due to the fact that they have better inspectors?
No, surely not, but I repeat, I have no comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country we consider as a model is also faced with a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any advantage in cooperating with our institution, right?
As regards national legislation, which has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment to the public procurement law, is its effects already felt?
Since this amendment came into force relatively recently, it has no impact on our control operations yet.
As we do rear controls, we have to count with some delay.
Our observations only concern the process of preparation of future controls – we have launched a new instrument of “detection of risks of poor management” with which we have brought about 14,000 public procurements – these changes will certainly feel because the thresholds have been changed, as well as the conditions for certain types of tender procedures and so on.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more severe and that it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulations, the provider (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) obliged controlled subjects to accept that any infringement of market law means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful to make the law harder in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not to punish those who make formal errors without any consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put better pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS was not going to disturb entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of the government cannot prevent an authority responsible for going to inspect and demand compliance with the law.
He can declare, "We're going to change the law and authorize it," but he cannot say we're going to act as if nothing was.
The Market Act contains relatively strict rules on formalities to be performed, and that is precisely in order to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its enforcement must be fair and this is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.
The roads are frozen places, but most remain practicable.
In some places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snowy.
The network remains mostly practicable, however, in some places with increased vigilance.

In the region of Karlovy Vary, the roads were practicable this morning, but by frozen and also snowy places.
Temperatures dropped and oscillate between -5 and -10 ° C, but they should slightly rise back in the day.
The snowfalls have stopped in the region and there is only a thin layer of snow in the plains.
The peaks of the metalliferous mountains (Krušné hory) are however covered with approximately 30 centimeters of snow.
From the regional road maintenance department data it shows that because of the mist, visibility was by reduced locations.
The rapid path R6 and the national roads in the region are now practicable without difficulty.
Vigilance remains however to be placed, for example, on some bridges whose coating can be frozen and sliding.
All departmental roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also practicable.
There remains on some of their sections frozen snow remains and by traffic-shaped places.
Especially in areas located at altitude, drivers must strengthen their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Roads and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some Eastern Bohemian roads are threatened by the formation of verts and that snow layers cracked by traffic can be found on the roads in mountainous areas and located at altitude.
Road maintenance services warn drivers against the risks of vertex formation in the areas of Pardubice region located at altitude.
There may be glass in the surroundings of Lanskrun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, and that mainly on departmental and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
The snow is mainly found in the Mountains of the Giants (Krkonoše) and the Mountains of the Eagle (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of snow cracked by traffic is present on roads in areas located in altitude.
In Eastern Bohem, the weather will be dry today, most often open, with potential cloudy passages.
It will blow a weak wind and temperatures will usually vary between -3° and +1° C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the region of Pilsen are now practicable, although in places it is necessary to be more vigilant and adapted to the weather.
It freezes this morning, temperatures oscillate between -3° and -9° C.
After the last snowfalls and the cooling that followed, some communication pathways can be frozen in places.
Drivers can expect to cross the mist areas, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what it appears from the information of the regional road maintenance department.
The D5 motorway is practicable almost difficult, however, road communication maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between 80 and 131 kilometers.
The coating of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the district of Pilsen-South and in the district of Tachov.
Departmental and third-class roads are wet and in this case warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on the less frequented roads of the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers traveling to the areas of the Olomouc region located at altitude today must count with a thick, soft snow layer on the roads.
This layer remained on the neckline called "Červenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after chemical treatment operations.
The snowfalls forced road maintenance staff to go to the field this night; according to the road service, it fell more than three centimeters in the Šumperk district.
In the other parts of the region, most trails are practicable without difficulty.
" On the heights of the Šumperk district there are snow remains.
Drivers running towards Jeseník must expect to meet a thick and soft snow layer in the necklace called "Červenohorské sedlo" said today in ČTK, head of road maintenance services in the Šumperk district.
Their colleagues from the Jeseník district also travelled at night; according to the latter, after chemical treatment, the roads are now free and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc roads are practicable without difficulty, however, drivers should be careful in the sections in the remaining wet forest areas.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
From this morning, North Bohemian road maintenance services reported several difficult sections.
Police data shows that in addition to some places covered with snow or glass, the mountain road ranging from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
The temperatures will remain below zero in lower altitude, and therefore the snow and verglass should remain on the roads. In the plains, particularly south-east of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there are no problems and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at the moment.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of verglas, particularly around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow melting during the day, clear sky and freezing during the night.
From the main traffic axes, difficult conditions on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec are also reported.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that have curved under the weight of the snow until they reach the path.
Simon Ornest said, “In concert, we want to collect positive energy.”
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
It's just one of these alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, we are laughing rather and we are said to be the only group capable of collecting a remainder of positive energy to repulse or prevent the end of the world.
Furthermore, you’re putting up a very unique project in December: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project more in detail to our readers?
It is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential for the end of the Maya calendar announced for December 21 at 11.10 a.m.
On December 20th, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will almost end at the time when the Maya calendar on the island of Kiribati, located in the Peaceful Ocean, will end on a 12-hour time zone in advance compared to us.
Who had that idea?
Initially I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Besides the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to think about the state of the world we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The group The Tap Tap with other interpreters also recorded a hymn against the end of the world entitled " End of the Cancelled World " (in Czech " Konec světa zrušeno ").
She is already very popular on YouTube, will you hear it on these charitable concerts as well?
Of course, everything in the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place...
It will be singed simultaneously by all interpreters in the three concerts.
The hymns will also join at a given time as part of a completely unique live show on Czech TV.
The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We work with other personalities in the Czech show-biz, due to the fact that we organize many charitable concerts and events...
We strive to make them participate intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it enjoys them.
What are the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the training center Studeo that is accessible to people with reduced mobility and whose work is to be achieved in the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap Association, for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedličkov Institute and offer them activities that interest them and enjoy them.
Students themselves do not have the way to get to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project into a new independent building.
Will several music bands and performers be on stage at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria have you chosen them?
We have tried to develop a program that is addressed to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, there will be Chinaski stage, Lesbian Support, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You can find all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other “mega events” like this in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time during the Prague Spring; there we will surely also prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech House in New York and personally, once on-site in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so terrible that it looks first.
We have five electric chair members whose engines must travel in sout, naturally we also trimbal a lot of luggage and instrument boxes....
So far everything has gone more or less well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, from which we came back recently, everything happened without any problems.
Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ for ease of access for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of public opinion towards people with disabilities and so on.
What were your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than in us, we have just witnessed in Moscow that all in the east are still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible for people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common that a person moves alone in electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider an evidence to give priority to a person in a chair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association striving to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities is being created.
What should we do with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we are still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements are still dependent on the efforts of the persons concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that people with a heavy disability move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, museum, anywhere...
It is still not very common that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, in this regard, you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Respect for the public and accessibilities are one thing, but the situation will really begin to change when we have among us well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawmakers.
For the moment, they are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap band is currently very popular, going back a few years ago, what has pushed you to create this band in 1998?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by a lot of young people ready to invest in something.
And as I am a musician (I play, among others, saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Láđa Angelovič says, we lost control of the situation (laughter).
Success has only happened in recent years, if I am not wrong?
It is true, creating links with known singers and working actively in promoting the group has helped us.
We understood that, if a work is not visible, it is as if it does not exist in the bottom.
Thanks to European Union grants, we can, in addition, allow us to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
The business show is full of things that copy each other.
In some ways, it’s logical: everything new is accepted with caution and it lasts long.
There are rare original projects, and I dare claim that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally mercy, it is natural.
But compassion is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned beings of all, which we must take in mercy.
They are people who can live a whole life and grow up, provided they have the necessary means of it, of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities can realize something, this is not only a step for them but for the whole society.
Isn’t your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we need to be intransigent in many areas and demand some discipline.
But I think it's quite normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize they need to come to repetitions twice a week, follow preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works in the same way in each group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap Group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
Only one, Láđa Angelovič.
We're an open group, people enter and leave, we can't do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who want or wish to join us.
This will be the day before the scheduled day of the end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 21:00 a.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba Arena, Brno in Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relays when the song of The Tap Tap group "The End of the Cancelled World" will be singed jointly.
The aim of the concert is to gather financial resources (to 25 million CZK) to equip the multifunctional training center Studeo located in Prague at the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, the entrance is free for children up to 12 years of age, the pre-sales of tickets is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as a twentieth member of the European Space Agency, it is the second member state of the former Eastern block (the Czech Republic became fully member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of projects from the agency over the years following.
The road from Poland to space, however, began much earlier.
Before the Second World War, passionate Polish worked on space flights; they did not always encounter understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on December 6, 1933, during which he presented ideas from his leading work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics " .
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the cold listeners and years later Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won in France Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his book "Introduction to astronautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became subsequently a large propagator of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many works devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a propagator of the world-renowned astronautics, his contribution was particularly rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the hidden face of the Moon.
As of 1925, a drain was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also not clear whether the rocket should be used to drive or brake the draisin.
The only information known on this drain is that of the press of the time.
As of 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrzyckiego.
It is evident from the retained documents that this research had reached the trial stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research was interrupted.
In 1937, the plans of a photoelectric hunting rocket, drawn by engineer Rohziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by a author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of the rocket technique were conducted by the provisional scientific advisory committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the works.
This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other works on aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish astronautic society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, a company is concerned in the November 1954 issue journal, in which there are four more detailed articles on aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the area of space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the International Astronautic Federation (created in 1951) and as early as the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice President of the International Astronautic Federation.
He retained his function until his death in 1959.
As of 1956, the PTA provided a significant contribution to the successful development of the meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, RM-1A, was built and, during the summer of 1959, two-storey RM-2 rocket flight trials were started in the Bledov desert.
This rocket had a length of 1.4 meters and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to perform concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had a range of up to 14.5 km and serve to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket was developed during the period 1962 - 1965, following the first RM-type rockets.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of space for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space with a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of engines was 37 km.
In the 1965-1968 period, Meteor-2 rockets were developed at the Aeronautics Institute, the first flight trials began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg at an altitude of approximately 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were later built.
It is also important to mention the entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this program.
The repeal of the Public Utility Law is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Utility Law.
This decision raised in the public a vibrant discussion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to consider this issue from a broader point of view.
Liberalism-oriented economic systems, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This concretely means that the different economic entities and national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of freedom of trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital allied to a scared financial speculation.
The considerable differences in labour price (wages) generate tension on prices.
It should be put under this term the following meaning: a producer strives by importing low-sold goods to resist economic competition by "making the competitor's price more expensive" with the aim of taking a larger share of the market and thus increasing its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, buying at low prices or disappearing. The result is a significant unemployment in countries where work prices are high compared to other economies.
Because private capital has no responsibility from the social point of view and therefore responsibility for unemployment it generates, the social burden of the State is necessarily increasing.
This entire situation intensifies the perfect bad will of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to the entire society by this race for the benefit.
This situation is at such a point of public notoriety that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
Unscrupulous practices of private capital create in the different economies a situation in which governments of the different countries are forced to start a mutual competition to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital at home.
In other words, governments put their own population at mercy of private capital without taking into account the social collapse.
This is manifested mainly in the amendments to the applicable laws.
The objective is to economically force its own population to accept the dictat of private capital prices, particularly in the field of wages.
This occurs on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the case of long-term unemployment and on the other hand by the restriction of employee rights in the field of labour legislation.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
In RFA, for years there are public food distribution points for the poor who cannot help their needs with their own work.
The number of these people is already counted by millions.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common that employees receive such salaries that the state is forced to pay a supplement to achieve the minimum of life.
Such a scandal has been updated, for example, in the case of employees working as assistants in the federal parliament.
The economy measures of almost all member states in the south of the EU, without a doubt, generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or to live with private wages, on the margin of society, in hope.
Here we have to ask ourselves the following question: Where does this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will grow from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or then a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also concerns all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and media say that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the directed economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy by regulatory interventions.
We must then wonder whether private capital does not influence and, even today, does not govern the entire state, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The evidence of this is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby in all states.
This results in a desperate situation demonstrating in the field of corruption, by granting mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In RFA, the situation is such that due to the lack of financial resources, national departments delegate the development of bills to industry-related law firms.
These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as western constitutions declare, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is evident that liberalism-oriented democracies are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "The crisis of the Roman Empire at the time of Caesar and Pompeus": "The State has long been in full delicacy and the functions were attributed by violence.
Pot-of-vin shots, favors obtained illegally, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The undertable and corruption proliferated unlimitedly, and the people went to the elections with voices already sold" ... "The honest people did not seek to obtain functions, it resulted once the state had remained eight months without consuls, but it really began to say that the remedy for this difficult situation was an absolute autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an absolute man."
In conclusion, as in ancient times, current society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard to the interest of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer capable of understanding and making the interests of society as a whole.
This results, today as once, in a decadence without preceding the elites, without any effort to carry out in-depth reforms.
Therefore, we must look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the scrupulous liberalization of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of things, the disappearance of these systems in the benefit of liberal democracies can be considered as a sort of break before a new stage.
The fact that current elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human lives, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from old and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Utility Law is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and internally, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue searching for ways to decrease the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investments in the economy, increase citizens' influence on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Chaos laboratory.
“Nothing will ever come out of violence and will never be able,” Sting says in the song entitled Fragile whose main verse of the refrain is, “Let’s not forget how fragile we are.”
“If my sons didn’t want wars, there would be no war,” said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild’s wife on her death bed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions arose.
Some take the party of Israel, arguing its right to self-defense and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the State of Israel's racism, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is a victim, in its waves of recurring killings; in all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of autonomous territories, are born in this political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
I would like to give readers a point of view "behind the curtain", on the one whose mainly benefit from the tensions that have been lasting for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Statement in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to study, others emerge from my own understanding of that, or more exactly of the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of events in modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
At every time, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individualities acted independently or whether they owe their acts to the throne to someone who led their acts based on previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we live at a time when the world’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers has not been able to be done during a single generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth is particularly distinguished by the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the pieuvre (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Oh, of course.
Since the 1990s, they acquired the first world news agency (Reuters) to end the establishment of ties between their names and serious criminal acts they were involved with and had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their wealth or both.
They have major participations in almost most central banks in the world and are preparing or leading wars against countries in which they still have such participations (before the central invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of Kadhafi under the only 4-bank control of Russia).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the central bank status to the Bank of America of Rothschild and began to issue his own money during the civil war (government, I understand well) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to issue clean money and wanted to dissolve the EFD, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 as he wanted to trial the EFD for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their worldwide power thirst led in the 1859s to 1871s to the formulation of a three-world war plan by Albert Pike, a 33th-degree mass franc initiated, being the highest level.
The first war aims to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to suppress colonialism, especially British, and the third should reduce the world's population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (sufficient to their luxury and comfort), creating a single universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but the end of an empowerment of such power).
The method used by the clan of the wealthiest families with their heads the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order according to chaos).
These solutions are false and still lead to an aggravation of the situation (see the creation of the EFD to avoid repeating crises such as those they caused in 1907).
After succeeding in triggering the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, an inheritance of Habsburg at the Austrian-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly by a German capitulation without economic and military justifications (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and it was followed by the morcellation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For a more easily triggering of the Second World War, bankers left politicians to create a latent conflict situation: on the one hand, they imposed Germany on far-reaching war repairs, thus generating the conditions of strongly radicalization of the poor German masses (then they sufficiently placed a sufficiently powerful national leader, showing the finger of the guilers and the simple solutions).
At the end of the nineteenth century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of which aims to create a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historic Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned above lay the basis for massive Jewish emigration to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which international bankers had initially held it; or if all he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the foundations for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; just as war repairs imposed on Germany were the origin of the Second World War, the founding of the State of Israel turned on a firehouse that could cause a third world war.
If international bankers manage to trigger this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like an immense laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (just see how people divide harshly between Israel’s supporters and defenders).
Who is guilty and victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong causes another wrong according to an endless circle of violence, and where some individuals have the charm and their desire to acquire power over the whole world?
Here we must make the difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as with us, international bankers offer people to elections only their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel is a typical example of fascinating, loyal politician towards international bankers, who does everything to trigger a war with Iran, which could, due to the adherence of this country to the worldwide destruction of cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) which extends to become a worldwide control and being given to Iran.
Under what light now appear the statements of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which any newborn is implanted at birth an electronic chip making it a fully controlled being.
May they force all individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave to bear a red iron mark on their hand or on their forehead, so that he cannot buy or sell anyone who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of its name.
It must be understood that whoever has good sense counts the figures of this ferocious beast.
This number refers to man and it is six hundred sixty-six."
The Argo movie: When everything goes to the most bad, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protesters composed of Islamist students took assault on the U.S. Embassy of Tehran and retained 52 diplomats in hostages.
They had to be released in exchange for Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the U.S. administration a positive outcome, it could not, indeed, give up Shah because it would have shaken the trust of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the liberation of the hostages.
It was a hard shot for the U.S. prestigious, still worsened later by the fiasco of the attempt to release the hostages by force.
The abducted diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following the negotiations held by the Algerian government.
Their fate raises a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iran feeling in the United States.
The Iranian debacle strongly contributed to Jimmy Carter’s defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo, actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offers a small victory to America.
Just before she was occupied, six employees escaped the embassy.
After complicated peripheries, they met in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to leave them out of Iran through a rocky cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a shooting team coming to make tracks for the shooting of a large science fiction show.
Combination of Genres
The exfiltration expert Tony Mendez’s plan requires Hollywood’s collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized shops reported this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained long secret, the film was based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
The Affleck movie is an unusual combination of several genres.
This is a part of a political thriller designed in a realistic way but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful blow, a betrayal - such as, for example, in the Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen trilogy.
Atmospheres succeed: Tehran sequences of documentary style (in subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations have been retranscrited in the film, there are no great differences),
lighter Hollywood passages, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions with common men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculous actor, he became a respected director and his play of actor stopped raising ironic remarks.
Argo is his third film after the dark police officer "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The Town" (2010).
It’s also the first Affleck film that doesn’t take place in his original city, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity which also suggests confusion and unpredictibility when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his employees get a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the false shooting team in the Tehran bazar).
Too many shares in too many places
The director had to be satisfied with a topic that actually offers few palpitable scenes, in the cinematic sense of the term.
It goes very well, sometimes it adds some elements to reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is displaced by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the landing track is pushed pretty much by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in his dissolved character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-operators, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far away, the only ones in this case.
Affleck’s movie lacks a little dramatic tension, it is left to be seen with moderate interest, appreciating the achievement and retro style of the 1970s.
He trains the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story again, in some way, unfinished to date, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of secret services such as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the case.
Rules to swell balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts annually a public survey of the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to launch the competition of the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
“The fact that the EU has recently considered adopting a quota of 40 per cent women for the leadership of large European companies has been the cause of our decision,” said Patrik Nacher, organizer of this investigation.
Among the absurdities mentioned is already, for example, the European Court's recent decision to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
However, so far, women were predicted in terms of life insurance rates because they are objectively a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other as incredible idea of "the EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the obligation to add organic components to fuels, which have environmental harmful consequences, or the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively low amount of a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of the cages of the chickens.
Critics have also been issued in the past against the fact ban on the use of the term "butter to tartin" or the removal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
Quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimeters.
The European administration often reacts under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose requests are usually defended by a state or group of states in Brussels (and the Czech Republic currently imposes the requests of its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, leading to the fact that in the Union bananas should not be less than 14 cm or have an abnormal curve.
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it only harmonizes non-homogeneous national standards that complicate trade.
Fruit and vegetable standards have been disrupted despite the opposition of certain States, claiming that existing guidelines lead to food waste.
The first prize may be awarded in this survey to last year’s EU Regulation that should include a warning on inflatable balloons indicating that children under the age of 8 should not inflate without surveillance of adults.
The EU referred to an American survey that balloons are, among the toys, the first cause of child death by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 for blowing in fair trumpets.
We also have weird ideas at our home.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: due to the sensitivity of this theme for Greece, any person with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Laissez-faire" of liberal economists, the Bankovnípoplatky.com server appointed in this survey, in addition to some absurdities mentioned above, the Union Regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our EU membership.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for conserved mushrooms and therefore risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey considered interesting the idea of paying money to some countries because they don't have access to the sea and the idea of granting to request grants.
These ideas, however, are not from Brussels but from Prague.
“The fact that we don’t have sea has a disability.
We will ask the European Union for a refund." Thus, in the autumn of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued that because of our wheat production, and following the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the state had found itself with full stocks that had then had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to Czech demand and organized a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Subsidies for the obtaining of grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which had to, concretely, be used to write requests for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU states that "bizarre regulations are rare."
While regulations often raises criticism in the Member States, many experts say, EU efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in the field of its overall development deserve rather praise.
For example, experts say the problem of using EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States during budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, must struggle in Brussels for the right to use specific denominations for these traditional products (fight of which it does not always come out winning) causes strong emotions among the Czechs.
At the end of six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky", for the name "Tuzemský rum" dating back to us in the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only alcohol-based cane sugar products, not beet sugar-based, can bear the name of rum.
In the official list of EU registered products, today is found with globally known cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck's mass or Parme's jambon, Karlovy Vary's biscuits ("Karlovarské suchary").
Pardubice's spice bread ("Pardubický perník") and cakes called "Hořice's Cornets" ("Hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I am just an amateur, says Senator Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how was the idea of attending the presidential elections?
It is not to be a senator or president that matters for me.
If everything worked without trouble in our country, I wouldn’t be a candidate anywhere.
But I no longer stand to see how the country has been plundered in the last twenty years, that thieves are not under lock and taxes and the age of retirement increases.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, then I try to bring a solution to change.
And since I am over forty years old and I am independent, member of any party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation than to present myself in the presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but you quickly went on to the Castle (N.D.T.: headquarters of the presidency).
Do you not turn your back to those who have elected you?
I’ve always said I’m going to launch in the battle for the Castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
Later, I said that if I were elected senator, I would attend the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it is just an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we're crashing at the bar or in front of our television station, but also that we're kicking coughs on those who try to make change.
To this is added the press that breaks the reputation of people and confuses freedom of speech with freedom of lie.
For instance, we have stated that I support the journalists or that I have been the advisor of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's come to your visions.
You have started the struggle for the Castle with the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax statements beyond twenty million [CZK].
For this purpose, you have to change the law.
As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When as a citizen, I pressured tourist guide activities to be a liberal profession, I gained cause.
The problem is politics: when someone comes from left or right with a good project, it is wisely refused and it delays citizens.
As an independent, a member of no party, I have much more chance to obtain support from all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and supporter dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you rather consider yourself a man on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people place me rather to the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
The important thing for me is that we are going forward.
What matters for me is not that people are left or right, but to bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or SDG, and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you are a populist?
But what you said doesn't prove?
When you develop a business plan in a business, you also have a certain optimal goal and a vision.
You're trying to bring yourself closer to it.
Some may call this populism, but all my proposals have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken of it.
But without the support of the parliament, there are only slogans left.
You will not survive long in politics with this.
Do you think if you are going to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I don't have any other option.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to bring them together to my camp in order to impose it.
If I were elected as President, it would not be a problem to retransmit live to television my request to the Presidents of Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parlia.
Then they should possibly explain why they don’t want it.
When there is a strong personality that will identify abuses, it will be possible to pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president in direct vote, it was obtained through the pressure of the public opinion.
I admit, without ambiguous, to be an amateur, not an engineer or an intellectual.
I’m trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I just started politics and try to obtain majority support for my program.
I'm trying, alone, to move things forward, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's like Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person cannot make the difference, so I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to attend the Senate elections as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed fraud at the mazout.
I presented myself because people are really dissatisfied but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of people did not vote and what they did, most of them, gave their voice to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that can hardly impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will struggle for my vision, for example, the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to create your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check whether the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don't have the financial resources.
I have no money for my presidential campaign either, I have only twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
Do you have no money?
You're talking about tax statements, what's yours?
I estimate about 60 million the value of my personal property.
I have a land worth 25 million in Prague, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of artwork worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin, because it was a kid’s dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving a car, was galant with the women, and fighted against evil and abuse.
You're driving in Aston Martin, you have a worth of 60 million and you don't have any money for your campaign?
Do you want to change the Republic but don’t want to invest your own money there?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I debt myself?
I've already invested two and a half million in the countryside.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program does not raise great interest.
I have no obligation to pay this campaign from my pocket.
My campaign fees are generally covered by the compensation I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn’t live, for example, pay for my son’s English school that costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I will not present myself to any elections.
Are you going to continue your business to live?
Didn't you say that you're putting your activities in deaf?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take the direction of the travel agency in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
However, I have to live from something.
What was your monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I keep winning between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.

The architects of the MVRDV cabinet prove that the real adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To be convinced, just contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly erected book mountain - 2 photos
“I think this building is funny, it is very futuristic, finally something interesting to see,” Lisette Verhaig, a crossing on the bottom of the street, says.
Stefan Spermon, an informatician in a large neighboring company, says, “Yes, he’s really beautiful, this building.”
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, nobody goes in one of these ringing libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dorm town that has nothing attractive to the gates of Rotterdam, holds a quite special record.
The 80,000-soul municipality shows the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to regain some neurons to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to general culture and to reproduce the seven fictional bridges on the euro banknotes in the form of beautiful small miniatures in armed concrete painted.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
This is how the city's authorities realized that there was only one way to resume the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam MVRDV architect office, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of buildings full of mind and often cynics, accepted the project with his usual flegma and presented himself at the competition in 2003 with five pounds under the arm and richness on the face.
And while the members of the jury still looked at each other, disappointed and haunted the shoulders, Maas, the faced, stacked his choice books by order of size to make it a pyramid, and finished his speech with activist arguments: "Common cherry!"
Here is my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as it is said, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain sprang out of land.
The building is part of a revitalization project including a underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few mitoyen buildings and houses for a total of 50 houses.
In early November, the book mountain received the second award "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This little tender village, which until today had nothing to offer than a post-modern pedestrian area and a town hall of a disgusting, white facades invite to think that it is home to milk, has been enriched with a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long path to reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under the bell of cheese.
Certainly, an elevator takes you to the heart of the massive, but the real joys of reading and architecture open to you when you crawl the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior entirely made of glass is bright and light, the floor in Dutch bricks and elegant reverberies speak clearly the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for public banks, dogs and little boys and girls playing the ball.
And everywhere books, books and more.
“Normally, the library rays are located along the facade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and unpersonal,” explains Willy Maas.
We have completely disturbed the classic space configuration and opened the reading spaces from inside to outside.
The interior of the book mountain was rightly arranged: in the middle are the offices, the internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical plant of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes lambs, sometimes balustrades, sometimes staircase ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even hard building architects and engineers do not want unknown materials.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found an ad hoc waste from agriculture in an agricultural company.
In the Netherlands, for years, the synthetic membrane of a millimeter thick has been used as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and we save time.
The fine membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be thrown.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, in plates of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 stairs is the top of the mountain.
After nearly 500 metres, the literary cafe offers us a stunning view of the city, as well as Dutch croquets and ficus in pots.
The latter create an atmosphere, but mostly contribute to maintaining the ideal level of moisture in the literary mountain air.
Donations to the new soul
“It’s incredible, but despite all glass surfaces, this building is a model ecology project,” says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is set by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun lights only a short time inside, even in the days of beautiful weather.
The thick wood beams mounted backwards compared to the glass facade serve as sunshine, intercepting much of the rays.
The atmosphere is very nice.
Completely automated stores load the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the septic computerman mentioned above, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there too.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "the finally found soul".
In fact, a few weeks ago, during the opening, each citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure has filled the empty of the library that was not yet completely filled (today it has 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing from everywhere.
For architect Winy Maas, “there is nothing worse than a library half empty.”
“I think our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even though it’s only for decoration.”
This is how MVRDV has reached the master discipline called, in the professional jargon, the creation of an identity.
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Even though it may seem young and little educated.
This is finally a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role."
Germany has chosen abstention during the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against Palestinians’ request to obtain the status of observer state to the United Nations.
But then she chose the abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not agree to what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, because it has special relationships with Israel.
But I also think it doesn’t support the US position either.
Germany wanted to affirm its independence, however, without being too critical to Israel.
During the insurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen abstention during the vote on the establishment of an air exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany have difficulty adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy that is defined by the Americans and establishing a German foreign policy.
In addition, the lack of coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
Therefore, the Germans face several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still tasting to find this role, but are on the path towards a "more normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, such as in France or Great Britain
What does then concretely mean the term "normal" foreign policy for the Germans?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent from those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national files.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of other major powers: this is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany’s position towards the Middle East conflict and abstention during the United Nations vote?
Germany first has significant results in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to strike the public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a crucial element.
However, I wouldn't give too much importance to this, because it's not an exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is in any case a crucial element in German strategic reflections.
Does Germany disrupt its relationships with the United States by choosing abstention on important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think Europeans and Americans understand perfectly the German position.
That is why I think the fracture is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will only be more respected.
Indeed, Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States announced their veto with a clear voice.
Does opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences due to the US internal political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government of course cannot defend its position publicly.
I think the real differences in opinions are not so big that they always seem.
If you observe the relationships between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from enthusiasm over Netanyahu’s policy.
Does Germany experience difficulty in reconciling its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other hand?
I think it doesn’t make things easier for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little simpler for Germans if there was a consistent and uniform European policy, but today it is not.
They cannot therefore register within a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
This is what they are doing in the issue of the euro.
In my view, Germany will take a locomotive role in the future and push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not simple for Germany, especially because of the relationships with Israel.
This question has always been delicate.
But I believe that the Germans are well aware that they have to play a role that marks more their independence.
Does Germany seem to play a role as a weight player on the international stage, does Germany only want to take a key role?
Does it always have difficulties in taking leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still having difficulty playing a more important role.
If, for example, we look at the euro crisis, we note that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn’t make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, it's always the same problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It must compose with neighbors and very varied opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the U.S. influence on European policy only decreases, but at the moment the EU does not fill this empty, then who remains?
Germans simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they're just less appreciated, it's life!
Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Washington Transatlantic Academy, an institute in which academics and policy experts in Europe and North America together analyze the challenges of the transatlantic community.
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialized in German policy, American foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
"Mark Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Became Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are brands known worldwide.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name is hidden a trademark officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
The brand therefore has a protection such as that the company bearing its name cannot file a complaint.
And even if she could, it is not sure she would gain a cause.
“It’s increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” explains Thomas Pattloch, Taylor Wessing’s lawyer specializing in violation of property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file comes to my desk.
Imitators need only a few additional letters to be able to record their brands.
Thus, instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also copied legally, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports items.
Pattloch opens a booklet in which the recordings made from the Beijing brand office are located.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by appropriating a portion of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copy and violation of intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping centers that sell virtually only counterfeiters.
The cases of Pattloch, however, are different: its commissioners charge him to address the fact that the Chinese brand office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name already protected in another country.
The Chinese talk about "Bang Mingpai", a relative brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women are designated to marry rich men.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame themselves.
“It’s bad for business, we need to fight this trend,” Pattloch says.
“The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous.”
Financial losses and judicial costs are millions for the sectors concerned, especially in terms of expensive lighthouse products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, China represents, with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion, the third world market for luxury products and the fastest growing market.
However, it is not easy to radiate the doubtful records from the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reported the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long time, the criticized name had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarism, because he would have hurt his brand in China.
In this field, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also relate to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the same company that just bought Putzmeister concrete pump manufacturer.
This is why Chinese people can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's acquirer, used a blue and white logo that reminded BMW's. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost against plagiards in Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the eye of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing, however, admitted to having experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the office would have spent last year from an "emergency situation in the work run to a recovered normality".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 proceedings remain suffering from the office.
Acting costs expensive
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million brand applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, it is a record and this means China is for the tenth time in a row leading the ranking for the number of new deposits worldwide.
This would also be worth the total number of legal trademarks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office would have counted 1.8 billion yuan registration duty.
In other words, each recording reported on average 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrates the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
Certainly, the Germans were able to obtain the illegal manufacturing of vehicle components to be suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain his Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
“This is our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany,” says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark office therefore rejected the objection of the Munich.
Freudenberg has obtained a cause gain from the following two instances, but the adversary party continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is in place
Today, the case is in case at the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of judges.
Nevertheless, he adds, "the procedure is long, trivial and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The archive department has even had to review the acts of the last hundred years to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even in vain proposed to the opponent a “big six-digit euro sum” to resolve the dispute.
"This is what we see what it means for us," Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overflow Europe.
This would be the case if imitators of this region would ensure the exploitation of unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to deposit Freudenberg name in Germany for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but had yet been able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: “Watchfulness is in place.”
Pattloch and advise German companies to be cautious in their business relationships with China.
It is not enough, they believe, to trust international brand law, foreigners should rather “record in China all that is likely to be protected,” as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than the costs of recording.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle during the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay license duties to the opponent for the use of his own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or we would lose our place in the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: footing, singing, helping
Imbongi choral repeats in Heidelberg, and Swaziland’s AIDS orphans are delighted with their coming.
This is the story of a link that crosses much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First of all, we take the foot: cowboy boots, basketballs, scarpines for ladies and mocassins for men looking for the pace by hitting the foot floor. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly enhance - alto, low, tenor and soprano - they rage, rage and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old orchestra chief almost loses his canvas shoes when he runs the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
We are Monday night, the Imbongi choir repeated a new song in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty singers aged 23 to 69 came from human medicine genetician to homeman.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, every chorist has different words, all in a very exotic language: the zolou, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Being Helpful to Help Yourself
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are suffering from the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
Moreover, more than 40% of the population is seropositive.
180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per less, you can become a sponsor.
This sum guarantees the child of money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means in zoulou "history-teller" or "chanter of praise".
No one can speak the Bantuan language commonly in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choral has repeated songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany to now return to its native region: South Africa.
Because at 8,733 kilometers a bird flight from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the voice power of the German choir.
40% of people with
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest straw or land huts and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans because HIV has taken their parents.
In Esitjeni, Swaziland’s highest HIV infection rate and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF, can be observed at a smaller scale.
The population practically never accepts male circumcision, a measure which yet guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland’s population is carrier of immunodeficiency virus and it is not rare to die in the middle of the thirty.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. The Imbongis mostly saw many children on the street who lacked not only parental care, but also simply all: food, clothes, education.
In a poor country, without a school degree, there is pretty much no perspective.
At the beginning, it was only a few people who were committed to pay a few euros each year so they could send a child to school and offer a hot meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that since then almost professionally occupies the AIDS orphans of Esitjeni.
Facts about Sexually Transmissible Infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial ISTs include syphilis, chlamydias and blenorragia (or gonorrhea).
Common ISTs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
The pouchs of the pubis and the gal belong to the parasitic ISTs.
What are the mainly concerned groups?
Syphilis and blennorragy often appear in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contacts between men are leading to at least four in five cases of syphilis declared in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomonase, candidiasis (fungal), blennoragy and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of HIV spread among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany, however, about 20% of new HIV infections are observed within this group.
In young people, a substantially higher rate of chlamydia-related infections is observed than in other population groups.
According to European reports, three-quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not required to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to Robert-Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases has more than doubled in 10 years: the number has increased from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011 there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual disease?
Infectious diseases can cause abscess in the genitals, urinary pain, white losses, lower window pain as well as the appearance of buttons and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can decrease the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or by narrow body contacts.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone who often changes sexual partners take regular exams.
Most quickly detected ISTs can be cured and late sequences can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but especially the funds that chorists harvest through their voices throughout Germany, the means are accumulated.
“In all, we’ve already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-secure woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well accommodated in one of their grandmothers, for example.
Gogos, so called the old women in Zoulou, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them welcome up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and ensure that they go to school every day in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is welcomed in a safe place at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, just like the two cookers who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chickens. With the support of the U.S. PSI Health Organization, the association organized a HIV test for many inhabitants.
This is not self-going, because even though the disease is well visible throughout the country, it remains a tabu subject.
A King and his 14 Wives
“AIDS is a real tabu,” explains Annette Lennartz, “because it’s a topic that affects sexuality.”
It is quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state sanctioned modes, among other things, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus throughout the country.
However, there are preservatives at every corner of street, Annette Lennartz adds, “but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh.”
In order to promote a little cultural exchange, Imbongi chorists travel together every two or three years in South Africa and tone songs full of nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that many inhabitants of the top of the black continent still know from apartheid time.
The bus filled with whites singing in African language is a sign of recognition such that it not only gives rise to good mood and joy, but sometimes also draws a tear from a few frightening border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where chorists visit their daughters.
Even though it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you'll find light there," people say there.
And after a 8,733 kilometers flight trip, back to Heidelberg, in front of these chorists stuck in the Bergheimer Straße repetition hall, light is also found.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as three studies published on Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of ice cover in the planet’s region constantly diving into the shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters up to 20 meters.
The water probably comes from comets or perhaps from asteroids that would have hit Mercure.
However, no one makes a link between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a life presence on the planet, explains Messenger probe chief scientist Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how water and other essential elements to life have arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed of the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which we observe the infinite.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets in our solar system, as well as the naive planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits around the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a “planet,” according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and the pink points, more difficult to identify, are the "new born" in the birth hall of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered the area where the stars are born, called "W5", a very little romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopea, at 6,500 light years.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope has photographed the flaming brightness of a star dying.
The bean-shaped circle consists of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the vast Trifide nebula, at 5,400 light-years of Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope has photographed this galactic birth hall.
The Pleiades, star racks also called "the seven sisters", can be observed at the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope makes the colors more valued.
On this infrared photo, the Helix nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation of the Verseau.
His resemblance to a land-continent gave him the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and the infrared photo makes it possible to observe a spectacular shade.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope have been able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the biggest enigmas of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving any traces.
One of the biggest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the shade, photographs of spiral galaxies can become true works of art.
The photograph published by the Southern European Observatory shows the nebula of the Trifide in the constellation of the Sagittarius, several thousands of light-years.
The name Trifides comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, shared in three), because three dust slides divide the bright heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic carrot in the constellation of the Serpentaire: 400 million light-years of the Earth, the cores of two fused galaxies haste towards each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy.
If you don’t like technical abbreviations, you can use its surname “southern fire wheel”.
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-year and consists of dust grains that are ten to hundred times smaller than the common domestic dust.
This photo was drawn up from optical and radiographic clips taken by different telescopes.
The circle of black holes is 430 million light-years from the Earth.
The Space Telescope has photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
The scientists named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our dairy path.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are connected by the Rosetta nebula, also constantly create young stars at 5,000 light-years of Earth.
In this light-ray galaxy, brought up with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists believe it was born shortly after bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our look at the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galilee used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have never ceased to grow, and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale Telescope of the Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona in the United States.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, on the Canary Islands, is enormous. The mirror alone reachs a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa has been segmented to save.
The diameter still reaches approximately 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed to the vertical angle, which limits mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also attached to the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its great capacity to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity approaches those of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe looking for extraterrestrial signals using the radiotelescope of Arecibo (Puerto Rico).
This radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone owner of a computer can help "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "Search of Extraterrestrial Intelligence") by contributing to the calculation power of its machine.
View of the Southern European Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 meters, consisting of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take clichés until 2018 as soon as possible.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were regarded as the largest in the world.
They treed two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck’s telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory that watches the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A gigantic new telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has given us images of the remote worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 planets candidates since the mission began.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space as early as 2018 on board an Ariane 5.
The first mirror of the infrared spatial telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope will be mission to find the light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercury is also home to ice.
However, there is no reliable data on this theory, as Messenger orbits far closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
Radar data has indicated the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty of it.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach the worthy ages of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach the worthy ages of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years.
The journey to the Talysh mountains is of a cracked romanticism.
Along the many turns of the road, the small bus cahots along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, we would almost believe in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group named Talysh lives, about which we do not know much, except that they speak perfectly the Persian and the azer and have a very great lifetime.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town is a plast with its too aggressive architecture from the Soviet era that does not match at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one path.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, 48-year-old Pilata Fatulayeva is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place.
“Bakou has become famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world,” explains Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of this kind in the world.
There you can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh in the area that are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white.
Here's my grandfather, he reached the age of 120.
Having a child at 136 years old
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who had been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth act.
And when one thinks that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, the age of Müslümov seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," said Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have conceived a girl.
Şirali Müslümov would have been misleading for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard of man in Central Asia.
“Astonishingly older people also live in some areas of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” explains Scholz, “in Sardinia as well, there are men who live incredibly old.”
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the non-existence of the documents, without counting that there was no civil status register.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
Nevertheless, it is true that people in the region of Lerik often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for longevity in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azerian tourist guide, explains that the Talyshs have special genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, believes that this is a matter of food.
However, it doesn’t seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that Talysh’s calorie-rich meals, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and whose many drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple lifestyle that preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a small village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She is sitting on the ground next to a barrel, whose content she beats unleashingly.
Eight people live here under a single roof, including one of the sons of Mirzayeva and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two little kids also came in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests serving in typical belly-shaped armed glasses.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under his heel hide from a dark blonde’s long straps that his son reveals to us with pride.
I’ve always washed my hair with milk, and that’s how I never lost them and they kept their color.
“I have never used shampoo,” Mirzayeva adds.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and little grass.
In my lifetime, I have never bought any food from a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the orders.
The language of propaganda surprises in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the worship of the nation's father figure, a man who nevertheless led his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham later succeeded him.
However, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not experience distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats monthly (about the same sum as in euros) for her retirement, a sum that guarantees a good living train in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s son for a long time has been right: “The elders enjoy great respect in our culture.”
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "rights of man" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations reveal the deep fracture of the country.
The sharia-based draft constitution is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president is not aware of emotion-filled words.
We have to succeed in the transition.
“And this success is my responsibility towards the people and towards God,” he told state television.
His speech was intended for the whole people, but also especially for Christian Copts, liberals, illuminated and secular Muslims.
Because all the members of the confused and desperately disappointed opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost excusing himself, having temporarily restricted the jurisdictions of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own "in order to save the revolution."
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what it wants to save this 61-year-old engineer, holder of a PhD from the American University of South California.
Will the judicial power be overthrown?
The 234 articles written by the majority Islamic constituent assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour night force tour are actually to a certain extent concerning.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what does the word “principes” really mean?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague formulation and the margin of legal maneuver that results from it to apply a more strict interpretation of sharia.
In any case, a newly introduced article states that, with regard to all topics concerning sharia, the University of Al-Azhar must be consulted. The establishment is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its glory radiates on all the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative apparatus, which would de facto lead to the placement of the judicial authority under the guardianship.
Many points of the draft Constitution are matters to be interpreted
Another issue is the likely maintainment of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts used to repress the opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The state must also, can be read in the project, protect “the true nature of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morality and values.”
From a legal point of view, the formulation is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematography art and literature.
Clearly, it would simply be censorship.
Furthermore, no items expressly guarantee equality between men and women.
Instead, another article is prohibited from offensing or slandering the prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what an offense is or how it should be punished.
Equally doubtful is the formulation leaving hearing that it is forbidden to “offense people”.
Is it sufficient to draw a president's caricature or to tell a joke at the expense of a lawman?
Therefore, many points are matters to be interpreted in the project that Morsi submits to the vote, which, according to his own words, will "very soon" be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The Revolution Renews"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concord on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to drop Sharia before it entered into force.
"The revolution reborns and we're going to win," launches Hamdin Sabbahi, who came to the third presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former Chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said the draft Constitution is "to throw into the waste of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to foster a “putsch against democracy.”
"If he proclaims the referendum, we'll go to his palace and overthrow it," said Jasser Said, an opponent.
“We’re not tired yet, our brothers’ blood is not expied yet,” said Khaled Ali, a politician and opposition member.
Furthermore, several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution.”
On the other hand, the well-organized Muslim brotherhood called for a counter-manifestation not on Tahrir Square by precautionary measure, but on the other bank of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the University of Cairo.
The hidden women and the supporters of the salafists, who participated in a large number, screamed, “the people call for enforcement of the law of God.”
“Remove our country!” they asked Morsi, saying “the Quran [is] their Constitution.”
A fight for sovereignty on the symbolic square of Tharir, where everything began, would quickly have created a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that’s what Morsi’s supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said the opponents of the draft Constitution, as well as its supporters, had expressed themselves high and strong.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the urns of the direction that the country must take.
The Islamist project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once."
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry on this imposed constitutional process that should have extended until February and encompassed all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or before the courts under Mubarak.
He did it not because he shared their concept of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That's why he was shot, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even spoken once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the World am Sonntag.
The expansion of Morsi's powers to the three powers has discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are screaming violations of the rules of democracy and will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto removes all his powers from him,” Saeda deplores.
However, a democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could be paid.
A protester on the Tharir square warns: "You are born of a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway’s Rakfisk: Is it the most smelling fish in the world?
The five million people in Norway benefit from one of the highest levels of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the country’s success secret be linked to the appetite of locals for an extremely smelling fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway’s most popular meals.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this scent, omnipresent, impregnates the air.
The rakfisk consists of salt-powered truit and fermented in the water for a duration - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When the darkness sets up and it’s cold, Norwegians gather massively to attend a festival that takes place here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary speciality.
“You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit,” explains Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter who is also called “Rakfisk General”, responsible for the festival’s management.
Around us, people valent small pieces of fish and encamp a large amount of drink.
“Some people prefer aquavit in Rakfisk,” Havard adds.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it’s not bad - it remembers a sushi that would have spent long hours in a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in air-resistant water barrels and then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - undoubtedly with the senses smoothly by alcohol - ate.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave their country to find work, mainly migrants to the United States.
Now the population grows rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted to full employment, high wages and a full health system.
The Swedish, their old rivals whose country was not so long richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered something important, a vital element, although smelling, of the past of Norway.
This is part of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small beer pint or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not unpleasant for it.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they talk about “the incident of July 22.”
Norwegians have difficulty accepting that in their peaceful country one of them had committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has owed its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
“But oil is not the unique reason that justifies our success,” explains our servant Anna, at the blonde hair and in the eyes of a transpersing blue, the picture of the Nordic well-being, with a handful of rakfisk.
We are - how you say - cautious people.
His English, like that of most people living here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we don’t like to make us noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with much caution - everything, except for a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries threw money through the windows, over the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep the cords of its stock exchange well tight.
“As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy,” Anna said.
“Without forgetting the rakfisk,” she adds in an unfailing laughter.
I stand under the snow and do my tail to buy what to eat - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger made up of a stage, a real discovery, it's great.
But tonight, the smell of the fish is everywhere.
The hotel I stay in is one of the many places where you are serving Rakfisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most smelling of them.
There is a TV show where the presentator carries a butterfly node, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
We would believe in the Eurovision competition.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"There are our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or perhaps because of fish emanations.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
While President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, from the BBC, is interested in the difficulties that await him and the expectations of the people, which are many.
Road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad today.
In a city where bottlenecks are legion in normal time, a security dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the objective was not to prevent people from going to their work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task is waiting for him.
The economy of Mexico is doing well, results owed to the outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the steadfast of a drug war that has already cost about 60,000 people to live in six years.
"My government has committed to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Bureau a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the US president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A very populated and tentacular state that surrounds the capital. In its land of preference, the opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the Bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is registered in the memory of all.
The locals attribute it to the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new highways of M. Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made on these roads, once bobbing and full of cracks.
Plates that trees his name are hanging outside of a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We rely on him to put in place sustainable changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the congress and the PRI party of Pena Nieto.
In terms of safety and economy, we hope a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was evacuated in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congress member Olvera acknowledges that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party concerning Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticism of opponents who blame the new president for missing charism.
He is a whole man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is a great man of state and, above all, he can listen.
However, this is not always the image that the people of their former governor have.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flagrant.
Hidden under the selfpoints of the highways, it is, in many ways, a forefront of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military was called to rescue to fight drug gangs in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a harmful area, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the last two years have been found on the border of discharge.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a sadly famous place for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
Mr. Pena Nieto's detractors say that at best, he failed to address the problem of women's murders when he was in charge.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see reality in front.
In a concrete house, typical of this unlawful neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to retain her tears when she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reported a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
“When I came to her home, he seemed to me that her body was washed,” says Mrs. Buendia.
Signs indicated that it had been beaten, and the cadaveric rigidity was already started.
While his mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana dressed the wall, next to a cross where the word appears: Justice.
However, that’s exactly what the family has been denied.
The authorities treated me as if I was an old commuter, a trouble painter, a crying.
They want us to accept what they say and keep us quiet.
“But it’s not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,” she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives her shaft on Saturday, she will be accompanied by heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has made the promise that he would prioritize it during his term.
"I hope he will be as good as president as when he was governor," Olvera said in Valle del Bravo.
However, that’s exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza are most afraid.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, the prosecutors said.
Attorneys are trying to counter the claims of abuse that Bradley Manning would have been victim during detention.
The trial relates to Manning’s detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to classify the case on the ground that Manning’s sequestration has been made under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stolen thousands of confidential documents.
Attorneys tried to demonstrate on Friday that soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being the cause of the largest leak of confidential information in the history of the U.S. Army -- missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claims had suffered during his military detention.
During a counter-interrogation with Manning during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Major Ashden Fein claimed that records of weekly visits made to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, have not revealed any complaints about his treatment.
The counter-interrogation -- during an hearing, the defence filed a demanding claim for the Manning case to be classified on the ground that the sequestration was made under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place a day after Manning witnessed his desire to suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, was accused of stolen thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At the Friday hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that officers had filled out after their meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico military prison, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and sent his answers.
When Fein mentioned the forms on Friday, Manning recognized that the treatment his guards reserved him was "excellent" and that the treatment he had in the prison was "very professional."
The forms do not report any complaints for ill-treatment, although the officers had directly asked him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he orally expressed concerns about certain issues and that the officers visiting had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would take care of these issues, but they did not acknowledge the issues discussed.
“They wrote ‘no problems’ (after addressing concerns), and however, it didn’t mean that I had no problems,” Manning said.
Military judge Colonel Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment during a January 2011 interview with the special committee meeting to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning said his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a "injury risk."
The military said they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below near surveillance for suicide risk -- for his protection and safety of others.
"I wanted staff to know that I was going well, and I wanted that I was withdrawn from this status... in order to benefit from better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning witnessed on Thursday his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered himself to suicide when he was in Kuwait and had once gone away from heat.
He added that the fact that he had not been kept aware of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very angry.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent the clearest of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had were a mattress, cover, tongs, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay in motion because sleeping or staying long during the day was contrary to the regulation.
Manning also stated that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, on the outside of his cell.
If the guards didn’t see his face when he turned at night, they would wake him up to see his face.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint for treatments suffered by Manning in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning questions about an allegation reported in his witness on Thursday -- that after having been forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other detainees one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time he was allowed to cover himself with a cover during the call.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he had deducted from the order of his guard that he had to leave his cover that could have hidden his nudity, but he recognized that no one had ordered him to leave it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning would have told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his slip or tones to injure himself, but that he didn't.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, tongs, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he had experienced during his detention and that he will dramatically reduce his sentence if he was to be sentenced guilty in the martial court, a trial that should take place early next year.
The defense said Manning is considering prosecuting the least serious offences and fighting for abandoning other charges considered too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning was imprisoned in accordance with the regulation governing the conditions of detention of all inmates in Quantico.
Prosecutors against Manning include theft of goods or public documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information on national defence.
If all the heads of charges are held, he encourages forever criminal detention.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says many have been forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities.
The Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind Mexicans of the difficult periods, he said.
Navarrette says Mexico-Americans are taken between two worlds.
During a recent trip to Mexico, when I arrived in the hall, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two paths: one for the "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), and another for the "Foreigners" ("Foreigners").
I remained immovable for several seconds, not knowing to which file I was heading.
I grew up in the center of California, where I was called the "Mexican" all my life.
It’s an ethnic qualification, just like that my Boston friends use when they say “Irish,” or my New York friends when they say “Italian.”
Then I became “Mexico-American.”
But here was Mexico.
And, on the earth that has seen my grandfather be born, no need for special qualification or union trait.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to manage an interview in either language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an Aboriginal, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and went to the "Foreigners" row.
I thought at that time of the week when new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their preferred themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons that push Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than risk in the United States.
He wishes to join the United States and Canada and create a trade Union on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to pursuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to hand over half of their territory in writing to the top of the gun.
But for the Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes any criticism to Mexico, you start hearing -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans are affecting the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for the fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that the country has with the more than 35 million Mexico-Americans living in the United States.
Do you want us to discuss the topic of bitterness?
There are a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point, in our genealogical tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparents, has found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to north.
And most often, this person corresponded to a type profile -- dark skin, little educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we are currently living the American dream, that we have gone to good schools and that we have good situations, we should never forget that this is the American dream we are living, not the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We agree to the United States.
Moreover, we know that some of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not love us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they thrive us as if we were lower and not enough Mexican individuals.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife who was born in Guadalajara and legally emigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexico-Americans, as Mexicans strongerly claim their identity and Mexico-Americans are contrivious.
Although she is a U.S. citizen, she feels that she is part of two countries.
Furthermore, many Mexico-Americans I know do not feel like they are part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of the two worlds, but we are not rooted in either of the two.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligent want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexico-Americans to work as wealth ambassadors for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a great country that must absolutely be visited and pressed political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And if we consider wage inequalities, corruption and drug-related violence that are omnipresent, many of us are not convinced that it is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to do it alone, friends.
It's normal.
Although some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States in the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore agree that some Mexicans still want them in the way their family members were treated so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we are more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old disputes, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there never be a lasting peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodflow seems to indicate that such hope is vain.
While the same futile arguments remain to know who began, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and for the first time rockets drawn from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Israel.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be blocked in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full change.
The Arab spring has made everything fleeing, and whether it is liked or not, Palestinians and Israelis are trapped by this regional disruption.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
However, there are all reasons to think that it could help them get out of this deadly impasse.
A war that makes no loser or winner
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Even though the ceasefire granted on 21 November remains, this week’s fighting strengthened supporters of force on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has been leading Gaza since 2007, will strive to have forced the Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza has wiped out.
Having killed some of its leaders and removed Gaza’s 1.7 million inhabitants in one of the world’s most miserable and overpopular corners, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas gains ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals of Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a rising regional power, once the nearest Muslim ally to Israel, took up and cause for Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members rejoice and say that the growing Islamist curves around Israel, from Lebanon to north, where the Hezbollah militia exerts its rule, through Syria, where Islamist rebels can overthrow Bashar el-Assad, and to Jordan, where the Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern side of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, far from the most populated and central Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to spend to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood are Hamas cousins, and their leaders are easier to remember the public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that cannot be excluded by Israel and America anymore.
Meanwhile, supporters of Israel’s hard line will draw the reverse conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was brought into box.
The Iron Dome missile interception system has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on both ears for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its indefectible support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being the cause of the last wave of violence.
But above all, Israel has prospered, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although rocket shootings in Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide attacks, particularly thanks to the separation barrier that hits the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite international illegality.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has merged with an even more bellicist party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman in the approach to the election of 22 January, has the beautiful party.
Why dorlote these Palestinian fichus by giving them a state?
If they were leading the West Bank, would they not throw rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they get out of their head.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will win it; but it may be that Arab spring will change it.
Although the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate little Israel, their priority will be to address problems in their own countries.
The defence budget of Israel is more important than that of its four Arab neighbors gathered.
Starting a war with local superpower will not help new Arab governments arrange their savings.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire what is good--and might mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a dust that is intended to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a little like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population is increasing.
Bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic award.
Both sides need to be pushed by those outside.
The answer remains that of the reasonable people found on each side, and by most of the outside world, and by this newspaper: two states, with Israel's transfer of territory in exchange for security.
A small and short-term hope is that the ceasefire will give outside people the opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which now has to strive to end the traffic of weapons to Gaza, as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also press Hamas and Fatah to unite them.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the upcoming proposal of a pseudo state to the United Nations.
Obama is also interested in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first term he did not present his own peace plan.
Back to the White House, it seems likewise reluctant to establish one.
It's a very tricked vision.
The Middle East’s stability is a vital challenge for America.
This goes through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for Neutral Cigarette Packages entered into force in Australia
Warnings and pictures of sick organs cover the dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand.
This law entered into force in Australia is a world premiere, the logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrible pictures of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by their parents' smoking.
Besides the various photos and sanitary warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small characters on all packages.
It is the most strict tobacco packaging diet in the world.
The Australian federal government said the goal was to dissuade young people from smoking by suppressing any glamour representation.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26, there is 99% of chances that they will never start.
“Even when they are very young, children understand the message tobacco manufacturers carried out through their brand image,” said federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess.
Although Australia records the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has pressured against this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said that this would renew the black market trade, which will give easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
"Hazardous consequences will arise from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian falsifiers will sell more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law has dynamicized their activity.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said the demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to hide horrible packaging, has increased heavily two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco disputed the law and lost before the Australian High Court.
Ha said Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is waiting for stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only boredom, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population group targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting TV advertising, sports sponsorship and the obligation for resellers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the web by companies and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing it.
“If you’re working in tobacco marketing and only have a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the key place by excellence,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman has noticed an increase in contributions from some Lambda citizens in favour of brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Should we wonder whether it’s just a citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has been worried to make a video, or whether it’s an agency-orchestrated marketing campaign?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry focuses on the new regulation rather than marketing.
The industry has gone to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest these new judgments - these countries told the WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries had had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be taken in the course of 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries about similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
Now these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More severe laws are currently under study in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The pictures don't bother me.
I don't know them.
"You're taking a cigarette and hold the package," said Victor El Hage at the time of buying a package on which a picture of tumor from the mouth.
To be honest, the only reason that makes me arrest is my little daughter.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in central Sydney, said that packaging uniformity makes it difficult to store packages on stairs.
“Before I took an hour to unload a package, now I took four hours,” Yu said.
“The government had to forbid them once for all and we would have said OK, it’s okay, we stop and put the key under the door,” he added, raising arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during Thanksgiving, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I had enough time to think about the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport to wait for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (without forgetting duty-free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and experts specialised in child development praise boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, or even to feed creativity.
And as we are, mostly, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
And no.
But I'll go back.
First, like many people, I thought boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The boredom goes back far away," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they go back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and discussed, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, an aggregate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After browsing numerous publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that consists of "willing to do something, but not managing to start a satisfactory activity."
What distinguishes boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task although he wishes.
With apathy, he said, there is no desire to do something.
What is at the heart of boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a bad mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom can look strongly like a depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both can be connected, people who are bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we may think we're bored while it's actually a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an older experience in which participants were listening to the cassette, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the room next to, the too high sound of a TV show that had no reports, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not at all hear the soundtrack.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said they had bored more than the other two groups - they had trouble focusing, but didn't know why, and attributed this concentration problem to boredom.
When you’re trying to focus on a difficult or stakeholder task, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an aggregate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
On the other hand, when you perform a boring task, "like watching objects on a mounting chain, music can help you not bore."
In fact, he says, we now know that when one tortures or grips, these gestures, often considered signs of boredom, are actually a good way to remain more physically alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to stick learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay without moving,” said Professor Fenske.
We are all bored one day or another - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a single-cord voice, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Scale of predisposition to boredom" in the 1980s.
The scale includes assertions such as, "Among the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotone," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need many and varied stimulations.
But in general, adolescents are quickly blashed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience during which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of adolescents were bored at school and during their homework, while 23 percent were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they are bored.
Professor Larson said he didn’t know whether today’s boredom percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a period when boredom reaches its highest level," especially because children and adolescents don't have much control over what they want to do.
If I repose my question: Is boredom good for you?
Sometimes no, because in its extreme form, this can lead people to taking absurd physical risks, bet or abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
“Boredom is the way the brain has found to make you know you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn’t always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you're bored and you're using this energy to play guitar and cooking, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he will not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to take care of himself or self-regulate, says Professor Fenske.
And “this self-regulation passes from one situation to another,” he says.
Your child doesn’t only learn to have fun, it gets more control over himself in other fields.
I don't think we should glorify the boredom.
Just as I don’t think we should criticize it either.
Feeling comfortable outside the constant boiling that generates activities and technology is the goal we should tend to.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this.
“We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that has meaning,” he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate stop times.
“In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated,” he added, “it’s hard to find ways to get into something when noise stops.”
In Colorado, no directives for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a student at a university and football player in Colorado, is charged for something that will soon become legal in his state: the possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco received a quote to appear for possession of drugs and equipment that could serve for its consumption - minor offences, each accompanied by a fine of $100 - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated as criminals," Orozco said.
But is it one?
During the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado’s vote to legalize the consumption of small quantities of marijuana for its personal use, the response to hundreds of businesses involving low drug use depends more on the place than on the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offences involving marijuana use were classified without continuity.
Police services have ceased to charge adults 21 and older for minor marijuana possession, as the law will enter into force in the coming weeks.
But the prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative districts have called on to accelerate existing marijuana affairs and continue to charge people who own it.
At the same time, several cities in the outskirts of Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-owned marijuana sales shops in their neighborhoods.
“Things are evolving so quickly that I don’t know what the future reserves us,” said Aurora police chief Daniel J. Oates in eastern Denver.
Washington State regulatory bodies also ask a lot of questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a license system, authorizing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the expiry date of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether it is liked or not, is ahead of most states in terms of marijuana regulation, first of all in terms of use for therapeutic purposes and now in terms of personal use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market and is a good indicator,” said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Smith recognizes, can do more than suggest what works.
“There is no real precedent we could rely on,” he said.
Washington’s law, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a legal vacuum of one year, during which the permit system will still not exist, while possession of marijuana will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical issues remain in discharge: how to balance the state’s mandate that guarantees appropriate access to authorized marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales shops within a range of 30 km around a school, a park, a playground or a crest.
“There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install an authorized trade for sale of cannabis, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Cannabis Legalization Centre, a recently trained research group.
On 21 November, police chief Oates in Aurora sent an email to his officers announcing that the "City Attorney" (representative of the public prosecution) would no longer pursue persons aged 21 and older who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to stop chargeing people for such "immediate offence."
Chief Oates said police would apply new judgments that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and he would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, the "district attorney" (Procuror of the Republic), Ken Buck, incarnates a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession affairs, primarily in order to pressure on users to get disintoxicated.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges.
"Our office has the obligation to prosecute those people who committed a crime that, at the time of facts, was a recognized crime," Buck said.
The reactions were complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for restricted marijuana consumption.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer make adults appear for possession of restricted quantities.
The representative of the county public prosecution, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to securely classify all marijuana detention cases.
"I don't feel like wasting my time to continue to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters have supported the measure, offering a legal and governmental framework suitable for personal marijuana consumption is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in various American cities highlight the profound ambivalence among local officials regarding legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with public prosecution representatives, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana consumption and who speaks as local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws).
"They have spent much of their lives prosecuting people who consumed marijuana, so they have difficulty accepting that it is legal," he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana consumption at the same level as that of alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are becoming a case of jurisprudence for drug legalization.
While defenders and state representatives provide for a new border of legal sales, they are concerned to wait for the federal government’s guidelines, which always conceives the sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
Marijuana legalization defenders hope that the Ministry of Justice will give up.
Despite some media arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and sellers, the federal government has especially allowed marijuana sales shops to exercise for therapeutic purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Although it is true that the police will probably not plunge the doors to catch small drug bags, there is a strong bet that it is opposed to authorized personal-use marijuana sales shops authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former Obama administration political adviser.
Many Colorado cities have not waited for federal authorities to act.
Much before the votes, some local administrations approved moratories for the creation of new marijuana sales shops, although it is only a delay of one year.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a six-month moratorium, and is expected to impose this ban next week.
“We don’t want to find us in a situation where a license is granted to someone and then face a federal problem,” said Bob Nicholson, a municipal council member.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in community voting rather than the state voting.
Many questions are asked.
Petronella Wyatt: I was misleaded and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
It is not only today’s students who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I remember, I have always dreamed of entering the University of Oxford.
My father and my older brother studied in what was for me an eminent place to know, a sort of Greek amphitheaster of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after moving to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to make my bags, causing the first scandal in my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were disappointed.
L'Evening Standard's newspaper claimed that I had left this university because I had objected to the fact that high school students had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson said with facety that I was left after being forced to drink in cups.
The truth was less funny.
I've fled.
Yeah, I fled because I had been a victim of intimidation and was subjected to constant brimade.
Not because of my rather outrageous name, nor because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for a single reason, and in this neighbourhood of the so-called knowing, I was victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my regretted father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advisor of Margaret Thatcher and I was a partisan of the Conservative Party.
Why talk about this today, you will tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of center-right students suffers the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them required protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Student Room (JCR) at Corpus Christi College said they were “often isolated, personally attacked and feel unwanted” because of their political opinions.
They want a representative within the University Committee on Equal Opportunities so that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary released on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Wonderland: Young, Intelligent and Right"), devoted to politics among students, and which depicted "Tories" as eccentrics and neonazis.
It was discovered in particular by student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who moves in Rolls-Royce, trees a complete silvery and moves with a chrome-head cane.
At other universities, Conservative students say they are treated as emitted goats of the establishment of increasing school charges."
Luke Black, 20, Vice President of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that there is a growing left-wing party at universities.
People think we are like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting.
21-year-old Samuel Roberts, a history student at the Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says that such a climate is "uncomfortable," and 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president of the OUCA, says that there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are central right.
"This is an impediment to the freedom of intellectual debates, as well as the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one to think of this in my first weeks in Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, then I was 18 years old and a paralyzing shyness.
The hate of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university voted the refusal to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, due to reducing the funding of higher education.
The atmosphere was charged with Stalinian vibrations.
From the first days of the host week, when new students met with others and teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen later.
I discovered that the teachers not only participated in sarcasms towards Tory students, but they also enjoyed them.
It was as if the policy concerning grevite minors, privatization and government opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa was engraved in the classroom woods.
The first sarcasm I was victimized concerned a translation into English of the 18th century French texts, and I was not prepared there.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "be sure to translate the first paragraph"
I lost foot.
Pitt, a little man with a pustule face, was easily tolerated.
"Do the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you to take French lessons during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy to make friends," he said.
I went back to my room, unconsolable.
During the dinner that night, I sat alone and I felt a slight tape on my shoulder.
He was a second year student of English studies, named James, who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said, gently.
I'm afraid it's like that.
Anyone suspected to be a Tory (conservator) is targeted.
It's hard enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even harder for you.
Most of the young Tory claim to be Labour (workers).
Later, at the local pub, I tried cowardly to hide myself.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything that Mrs. Thatcher had said.
This strategy failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political and economic science, who ironicly had studied at Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pork."
You're contaminated.
Other students recovered the refrain.
I was perverse, dirty.
"How do the Tories do love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, isn't it?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I only live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after the night fall?
Should I have to become Labour and deny my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly professor Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who teached at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its accession to the Marxist-Determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professor at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he told me.
I started making the shuttle between Oxford and my parents’ house in London, finding shelter with my family and citizen friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He was unbelieving.
During his studies in Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But this is the best place in the world,” he told me patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dreaming bells.
Even my Communist friends had unrivalled ways.
He had tears in the eyes.
Leave them a chance.
I'm sure it's for you.
That would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Fatigued by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and renounced his convictions.
During a work session led the next week, when another history teacher suggested the world’s most seriously, that I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Interiorly shaming, I admitted to being a victim of my parents' brain washing and calling them "old crazy."
The rest was short-term.
It's my father who dropped the last nail in my Oxford carriage.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed in my room, and after five minutes, my persecutors abandoned.
When they left, I made my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I've never gone back to it.
You can call me wet chicken.
No 18-year-old child should be victim of such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic thing is that it was Oxford, who not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but also benefits from an unspoilt reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance than notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interrogated Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian customers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
He recognized him during the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high-sewing models created for his sewing house over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the organ point of a story whose only protagonist is "he signs" Garavani, but who could not have been written without his famous customers.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, opened until 3 March next, an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the aristocratic cream, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, to Princess Mary-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits his personal memories such as the trophys of his social ascension: from the modest couturier of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, to the idol of the international jet set.
There is nothing wrong to love kingdom.
“At least, they don’t crush their cigarettes on your beautiful carpet as some stars of pop music do,” says baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
“We all loved being invited to her Gstaad cottage,” explains the former wife of “Heini” Thyssen, intimate friend of beauties of the time spent like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance than notoriety.
And even so, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has also not forgotten the sewing charism.
Several years ago, after a parade on Spain Square in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
His mind was seen and felt in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the Haute-Couture week in Paris in 1995.
"He will never pass fashion, because his creations are works of art," she concludes.
Parade of the line of nobility
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but shared loves.
He loves well-high people and with the greatest titles and they love him as well.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamour podium of sixty meters wide that proposes to exchange the roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must scroll on the podium to admire a "public" dreamy coatte with Valentino's main creations, such as the tailor who had chosen Jackie Kennedy for his marriage with Aristonesses, Fars, and Fars, and Fars.
Among this model audience are names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Couturier in 2006
Many of his customers say Valentino’s first clothes are like the first love, “impossible to forget.”
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a "gillette" jacket and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"This is a gift he had given me," said Naty Abascal, one of the sewing museums.
"I prefer him to everyone else for his femininity, his great love for women, and because he sublimes our beauty," the ex-duchess of Feria adds.
I really like the colors he uses, they are bright and illuminate his face.
The proportions are perfect.
The fashionable Princess Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg cannot forget the first time she carried a Valentino model.
When she was teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses.
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard of Line.
It was a red evening dress, with a steering loop, a draped bustler and a decollete to fall.
"It was a dream becoming reality," said Rodrigues d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Arenberg's princess keeps the seater's evening dress with "the greatest care, because a evening dress is not just a dress, she is also the memories she carries."
The "King" of Fashion
The great final of Somerset House’s exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller’s wedding dress wearing her wedding with Paul from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the seater thus calls his seaters) to make this ivory silk dress with pearl enclosures, twelve types of different toothpacks and a strip of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high seam of the late 20th century, “the return of customers from the high society.”
Obnubited for years by the “knowledge” of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani collects as many honors as any spouse of its customers.
“His refinement, his calmness, his careful and perfect appearance has always jumped me in the eyes,” said Arenberg.
The last time I saw it, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table of Count Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him."
If she's a princess who says...
The hardest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers risk their lives and health by carrying 70 pounds of sulphur through the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by carrying the sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day until the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gas emerging from the inwards of the earth solidifies in the contact with the air.
After harvesting large sulphur rocks, which weigh nearly 70 pounds, he installed them in two bamboo basks that he charged on his shoulders through the steep paths.
There are only 250 meters to the volcano top that culminates at 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a turtle look, maintaining the balance and measuring their steps to not stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a fault step could cost their life, as happened to a French tourist who made a deadly fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn five cents of euro for each kilogram of sulphur extract.
Once up there was a path between tourists who photographed them as though they were circus beasts, and wear the heavy basket painfully, they walk the 3 kilometers to the balance that a mining company set a little down at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian roupes (5 cents euros) per kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it to 10,000 rupies (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry as this mineral is very present in everyday life and is used to manufacture candles, artificial lights, cosmetics, dynamite and even serves to white sugar.
“As we carry about 70 pounds, we earn about 46,000 roupes (3.8 euros) every trip,” Anto, who usually makes three trips a day, explains.
Everyone takes 3 hours and ends out, but it allows him to earn 138,000 roupes (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misery for such an overhuman effort, it is the triple of what it would win in the fields.
“The income of minors is very high here, where the harvest of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) a day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” said the carrier who once worked as a mask on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 roupes (6,20 euros) a day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned near his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for an indisputable reason that, in Indonesia, is as Javaland as sulphur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hinduists."
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, muscle constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, he spent three of his life challenging the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already begun to make him pay the invoice although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, constantly mouth and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gas rejected by the volcano.
That's the price he needs to pay to pursue his dream.
“I’m going to work for two more years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French,” he promises in English more than acceptable.
Led by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, server or receptionist at a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
He shares an unhealthy wood massage with other carriers, stands up every day at two o'clock in the morning as the sulphur doesn't cease to sprinkle at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Challenging darkness, Anto descends into the crater by lighting himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
About 400 carriers load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company did not mechanize sulphur extraction to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their account and are paid by weight.
In addition, they also do not touch a sub of the 30,000 roupies (2.50 euros) of an increase per camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 roupies (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is done for beasts, not humans,” Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years since he left the college.
Capable to wear up to 110 pounds, he ensures that he will not stop working "as long as he can" because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged 10 to 18 years old.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my entire life.
Although sulphur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps minors in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... to which they obviously add their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the kne and shoulders, distorated by the basket.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only charge 50 pounds.
Each day, his companions and him extracted 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a path of goats invaded by the weeds.
“I won’t take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life,” says Unainik, opening my mouth well, unveiling several missing teeth.
The elder of his five children, 30 years old, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but perpetual misery from generation to generation is one of the most difficult jobs in the world: the human mules of the Kawah volcano.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans are responsible for the absence of children on career, stress and costs of access to property.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, fulfil our civil duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words come from an advertisement for mint pills, but despite this, or perhaps thanks to this, the video has spread as a powder slide on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references such as "Let's put a polichinell in the drawer" to laugh on Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the video advertising agency, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music for people to fulfill “their national duty.”
It is intended only for the Internet, so we have been able to make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt that it was a theme we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing perfumes to pheromons or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative but they did not necessarily work.
So we asked ourselves the following thing: what more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take it so lightly.
He spends $1,300 a year on policy to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favour of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this had few effects.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city of Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, in accordance with its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he found himself above 2, considered the rate of renewal, was in 1976.
Why do Singaporens not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Marriage and Family Policy Director of the National Population Division, says that it is due to "better education" and "a broader choice of career opportunities."
“This has allowed people to have a broader range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and the establishment of a family,” she explains.
These changes in social standards contributed to the increase in the number of singles and delayed marriage and birth, resulting in a decreased birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter the decrease of population has created resentment within the local population.
In Singapore there are websites that abundantly disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially against Chinese who are accused of pulling wages down and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in Singapore has experienced its worst electoral results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to fix the problem with the establishment of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenue, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, it began to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities began controlling the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale gains a lot of success.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the real estate company EL Developers, says its “shoe boxes” are sold much faster than larger housings.
They are more popular, in the sense that these housings are built far faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more cost-effective for our cash.
However, he acknowledges that the new standards give clearer instructions to the promoters, who were previously put sticks in the wheels if they wanted to offer too much small housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new regulations could be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, discussing with the Singaporeans working in the central financial district, it would seem that they are not going to have a lot of effects.
“People are very stressed, houses are expensive, just like education, that’s why people give it back to later,” a young framework said.
Other people may have children.
“But for me it’s important to have my money and time,” another 20-year-old young man says.
Men and women mention their career, stress and cost of access to property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
Thus, although the government tries to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
In accordance with the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary, it is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of private life that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private domain for the under 16 years of age?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he exposes to by broadcasting on the Internet events that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriodico interrogated five young boys, aged 10 to 15, frequent users of the canvas.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on a personal level and "password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
“I won’t unveil my most personal secrets in a post,” says ten-year-old Jorge when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has an account for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them, but not everyone,” he said.
On FB, I post nice images or games.
I also talk to my friends.
“I won’t share any of my photos or someone who would make the stupid,” he said.
The young boy acknowledges that it is bad to publish obscene photos, nude people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge assures that he meets his 35 friends on FB and his nine subscribers on Twitter.
The majority are of the family.
Her mother is part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just post them,” he adds.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk to remote parents or friends quickly,” he said.
He says he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He will also not trust someone who would recommend a foreigner.
The case of Joseph, 14, is different.
The teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of those registered on his list of friends.
"I don't worry about it because we have something in common, for example, music," he says.
According to the young boy, no one made any advances or asked for his address or telephone number.
"If they put pressure on me or require it, I would simply remove them from my account," he acknowledges.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences known today as cyber harassment are not foreign to the young boy.
One close to one of my friends was racketed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he said.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He just passed it in a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post pictures of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I would do it if I was angry or angry.
"Even if I know it's cyber harassment," he said.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a professor of English and licensed in Education and Learning, considers that, to guide children and adolescents, we must understand that the purpose of social media is to inform.
“The Internet has emerged as a way to search for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed,” she said.
Porras reports that academic Marc Prensky, who owns a master’s degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the book “Digital Natives and Immigrants,” uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are them, children and young people who were born with technology.
“We are the digital migrants who must teach them there, while we are ourselves learning,” she said.
He added that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a criterion defined on what it is appropriate to disclose, publish or tell to an age where they don't have the maturity needed to do so."
"We also ask them to be selective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences," she added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents confidentiality is to use questions that make them think.
“Saying not to do so doesn’t use anything,” she says.
Then, Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn’t tell a foreigner, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like they publish a picture of you like a friend you published?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you identify holiday pictures, do you ask others for permission to identify them?
And also, do everyone need to know what you do at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"When the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks," she said.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary teacher and education advisor, states that it is essential for parents to read consciously the conditions of use of social media.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have solid foundations to discuss with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, the age and what is allowed to share or publish," he said.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that we should not speak to foreigners.
The UNASUR Summit ended without the Lima Declaration to be made public
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, although it was announced previously and theoretically adopted by the seven present representatives.
Efe tried several times to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of States and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency reported initially that it would be released after the summit closed, and then stated that it would be published from one moment to another on the website of the government.
When they were asked about the text, they reported that its content had been exhibited by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists’ access to information on the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private, restricted audio session" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that circulated between journalists was given by the press officers of some of the UNASUR governments who attended the appointment, except for the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released on the day was the list of presidents present, causing some discomfort among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media that claimed more important information.
Later, the Presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the "final statement" of the summit, but it was President Humala's speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the 3rd Summit of South America Arab Country (ASPA) and, although this was requested by the press, he did not also share the statement called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official website of ASPA, you can verify that the document was published last March.
During both international appointments, Peruvian authorities have tried to set up safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited to the maximum obtaining of information.
The summit was also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment by the Hague Court that separates a different border between the two countries.
Peru’s Presidents Ollanta Humala and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the ICJ’s decision to hear the pleadings of both parties in the trial that Lima attempted against Santiago and which begins Monday in the Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will solve the disputes we have today in front of this international court," President Humala said in a statement.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country respectful of international law, peaceful resolution of controversies, treaties and international courts," President Piñera added by giving a handful to President Humala, next to the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia denounced this week the Bogota Covenant by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of the international court, following a decision on the maritime limits with Nicaragua that it considered as seriously wrong.
The summit held without the presence of Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from the UNASUR since 2011 after the destitution of its former President Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was charged with opening the deliberations in the morning and closeing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The official read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the action lines of 31 projects had been set between South American countries for a total of $17 million of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries would put into place "important steps to achieve the purpose of South American citizenship through the development of residence permit agreements."
He informed that actions would be implemented to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions for better drug accessibility, low-cost internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters."
With a crisis-in-Europe, “economic consolidation (Latin America) should not have a triumph matrix but must help increase our productive matrix and entertain a better future for our populations,” concluded President Humala.
“We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the connection of South America’s spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by joining our countries and generating new economic circuits,” the president said in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were concerned with Peru and were on the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador although it had not given more details.
Similarly, the final document refers to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow its reintegration into the South American Nations Union," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbors, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional appointment, he hoped to meet his Nicaragua counterpart Daniel Ortega in Mexico on Saturday to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through a judgment by the CIJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I will have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We're going to review all these pathways, they're not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will ask for discussion with this country," he said.
“I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilized and respectful manner possible,” said President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday where they planned to attend the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, to take power.
Similarly, in the framework of the summit, the block Defence Ministers will meet beforehand to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which attempts to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru provides the pro temporal presidency of the regional block.
“South America must learn from Europe how to integrate a citizenship,” said Rafael Correa.
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa today said that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which “South America, in this case, should take an example on Europe.”
President Correa, who participated in the 6th Summit of the South American Nations Union (Unasur), in Lima, said on state television TV Peru, that the Europeans were "entertained during the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but they were now almost a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the UNASUR member countries.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country must be achieved, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to belong to the past," he said.
Furthermore, the President of Ecuador demonstrated in favour of the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who strike our ears never compromise anything, on the contrary, we South Americans all have signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself did not betray his principles, but rather respected his “deep democratic values and human rights.”
He concluded that at the time, “there were founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected.”
Furthermore, he criticizes Swedish justice that demanded himself to submit his territory to an interrogation about alleged sexual offence while "Swedish legislation allows him to do so by video conference, which could be done from the Ecuador Embassy in London."
Correa claimed that there is a risk for Assange's mental and physical health to deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," the Ecuador president said.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“This works on anyone’s health,” he concludes.
Correa reports that Assange's asylum solution since June in the Equatorial Embassy of London, which would be the assignment of an out-of-conduct that would allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities, and he stresses that he had discussions in the wiki in order to find in London.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities because Assange’s lawyer Baltazar Garzón has launched a number of proceedings from various European bodies,” he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain granted the safe-drive from tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as fully allowed its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, asked Assange at the Ecuador Embassy in London, or asked him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he didn’t tolerate was “medicrity, bad faith, and the lies that harm freedom of expression.”
“The biggest enemies of press freedom are not malicious or perverse politicians, but bad journalists at the balance of greed, chantage and extortion,” he said.
In this sense, he congratulated that it would not be such journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that rule in Ecuador" and, rather than highlighting its reelection, "he would deep up the revolution to pursue the path and trace the right path."
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto on Paraguay in the UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and attempts to strike outfits", because in reality, it "destroyed the legitimacy of paraguay democracy".
Furthermore, the President of Ecuador considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of the Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua’s maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be exceeded by the willingness to move forward together.
We need to resolve them as a whole to overcome them and go forward.
At the same time, he said confidently in the proper resolution of the litigation on the maritime borders opposed Peru and Chile within the same court and stated that it is "benefit that Latin America seize international bodies if both countries agree to accept a judgment so firm that it is."
In reference to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to break a third consecutive term, he noted that he saw this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the primaries in February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this potential victory, but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I win, this would be my last presidential mandate and I will then withdraw from political life.
If we ever lose, I will also lose it.
“This is my decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just discussed with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a recurrence of President Chávez's health status," he said.
The Head of State of Ecuador today participated in Lima at the Sixth Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the South American Nations Union (Unasur), which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when he was confirmed the result of the test: seropositive.
“It’s as if the sky fell on my head,” he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make it “less painful,” in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to learn about him and his harshness was such as he just celebrated his 43th anniversary.
He is, undoubtedly, one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit at the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he met in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there was a lot of doubts, little choice of treatment and more stigmates.
Then even the director of a IMSS clinic avoided him to say goodbye “because he was voiceless.”
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their illness, many people still come when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who began treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said HCG HIV Unit Head Jaime Andrade Villanueva and considers that this information was validated in April.
Andrade Villanueva, an infectiologist and HIV/AIDS expert, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of allocation of the immune system at the time of diagnosis of patients, with better prospects for those not consumed CDs until 50 years.
To speak simply, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis at 25 years of age, “as long as he will remain under control, he will be able to live without problems up to 75 years of age,” the scientist explained.
In order to replace this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that the Mexicans' life expectancy is today an average of 76 years.
While it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people deceased from AIDS results has increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of UNAIDS), but it is also true that, since the emergence of AIDS, 60% of patients have been identified on national basis.
Only in Jalisco, 255 people were killed in 2011, and 187 were killed until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the last 12 years at least, we have never missed medications, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know they are infected, or they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact that "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what we need to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to perform earlier diagnosis and, for this reason, we need to propose massive screening tests to all those who ask for it."
The specialists and members of the State Council for AIDS Prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do his test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it complications and that despite his young age, he was already carrier of AIDS and suffered from sage.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
“If I’m going to die, it’s better I have fun three times a week,” they say, “it’s not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I do exercise, I take my medications.
To date, his parents only know that he is suffering from cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
“I’m working, I have a lot of activities, I’m traveling, I have an active sexual life, but I’m co-responsible, I pay attention to me and the other person,” says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his privacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, on the march of World Day Again AIDS.
Let them do the test, if they have taken any risks, the earlier they will know if they are seropositive and better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they must know that we can live like everyone, being responsible for it.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Preservatives on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, supports Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest lies in prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we were given packages of one hundred, it is very good, but it results, that some still have no access to condoms," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do?", asked with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance advisors, pharmacists and healthcare professionals, is the question adolescents do not want to hear.
It proposes to reorient this ineffective distribution; that condoms are not only sold to counters, but also to be found in public toilet distributors and in places that young people attend.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
It is also not about paying the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"That's not how sexuality works, it's best to provide condoms to people already sexually active," he said.
The numbers in Jalisco
13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV cases) are recorded.
The State is the fourth state of the country in the number of new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in the number of HIV patients.
92% of the contaminations are sexual, 6% blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each registered case, there are 4 or 5 people who ignore it.
A judgment ratified in appeal by a U.S. court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario causes a harmful precedent to all national companies with branches in the neighbouring country and having solvency problems.
Therefore, it seems that the survival procedures for companies authorised by Mexican laws are not valid in the country with the star banner, which is contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the coup on Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bankruptcy for the Northern District of Texas on July 15, leaves Mexican companies without defense against the possibility of embargo on their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will enable Mexico’s leading glass manufacturer to apply to the U.S. Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, as the judge of the case reports that creditors must register under the U.S. bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit Appeal Court, sitting in New Orleans, claims that the main proceedings are the formalized trade bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first item would involve denouncing international proceedings cooperation in cases of insolvency in enterprises with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law had been established for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the inter-partner vote, recognized in the critical mass of the trade bankruptcy, the debts contracted by Vitro subsidiaries towards the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring would not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are a half-dozen examples here, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debt was guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Faillites.
Furthermore, what is certain is that since the subsidiary votes remained, Vitro creditors who fought against this in the U.S. courts, i.e., the "vault" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 against 37.
A data omitted by the appeal court.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he has encountered since 2008 without stoping the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, affecting the costs to the country.
For the moment, the company of the family González Sada will appeal before the same appeal court for the vote to take place in its entirety, i.e. with the five judges, as only three had voted.
The insurance appeal will require non-prosperity and require the review of the trial by a higher instance, in this case the U.S. Supreme Court of Justice.
The most serious thing is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act was detailed, noting that it would release it from agreements signed by the two countries to set it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the U.
Furthermore, it notes that the country has followed the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-parts carbolage: they assume Vitro and they assume the country.

The Acta is Dead
The government highlighted a requirement of the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexico Ambassador to Japan had signed the Commercial Anti-Counterfeiting Agreement, known under its English seal of ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already of ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was well done that the Senate himself condemned this possibility, because it was considered an infringement to freedom of expression on social media.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
Basketball trotcher "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as big as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain bleeding condemned him to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, national basketball player, manager and leader of the national basketball team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or as president of the faith.
“I wore several headphones in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was President of the BSN, Chief Executive Officer of the National Team and President of the Federation in the 1990s,” Reyes recalls during a Primera Hora visit to Bayamón, where he resides with his faithful wife Isabel for more than 50 years.
“Basketball is my whole life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs that recall his off-standard route, witness to it.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, those he loves most are those who remind him of his passage as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-1950s until 1982, after spending 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
“This was my best years, the ones I had the most benefit because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
It has been a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired at the championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy entered the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the team's head," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been leader here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, "I have a hard player for you, he measures two meters.
"Do you want it?"
This is how to start Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember that he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another championship.
He rejoiced the Vaqueros Championship with Gausse, but only a distance since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his burdens and Mincy's burdens in the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States during the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if the Canadian judge hadn’t re-played us the last match, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you’ve seen?
She is one of the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favourite is that of Cuba’s Panamerican Games in 1991, when we won gold and put a scratch to the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one who won bronze during the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world's 90 knee problem.
A team that may not be the best in terms of individuals, but gave us a gold medal and great joy during the pre-Olympic Neuquén tournament in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicia and young Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement of the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all forecasts.
Which was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt, it is Piculín Ortiz.
His statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level as Piculin did.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues he played for.
Who was the best Portuguese leader?
It's very difficult to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I really like the work Leo Arill does.
What is your biggest success in the federation?
Being part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What are you left to do?
There are things I would have wanted to put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, Ponce’s boys play only in their area and only face teams from the other corners of the island at national play-offs.
Today, young people are traveling and playing too much while this is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and arbitrators.
This makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch clips from my time on YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, I attend basketball matches.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been next to me.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, was known worldwide by the main role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he incarnated an unscrupulous, frightening and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as an oil magnat without scrupulous J.R. Ewing in the TV series "Dallas" became a symbol of avarie in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year to J.R in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a family statement sent to The associated Press for Warner Bros., the production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back to his dear hometown in Dallas, playing once again the ironic role he loved most," the family said.
Larry's family and his close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who interpreted the role of his wife in the original series and in the subsequent, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, his press attached Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and I'll miss a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he was living life in depth," Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed liver cirrhosis in Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had recognized that he had drinked a lot for many years.
In 1995, he had been detected a malignant liver tumor and had been transplanted.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made himself known on television in the role of an ordinary type in the "Jinny of my dreams" series broadcast by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In this, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered an attractive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought her back home.
He also played in two comedies that remained short on the antenna, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in the cinema are well-received by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But this was thanks to his magistral interpretation of the deliciously hateful J.R. that Larry Hagman had his greatest success.
The dramatic series of the CBS channel on the Ewing clan and their relatives was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated speculation around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series has reached a record of hearing at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot her.
J.R. had made her pregnant and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she didn't leave the city, but others also had reason to aggress her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and unsatiable man but with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an infidel spouse who tried to internal his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it would take as an epitapher for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write: "Ciel the Honest Citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, recalled on Friday of Hagman as a "immense" man, both on the small screen and in life.
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each one of us, who had the chance to know him and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with a great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already completed for the second season and one sixth is underway, the chain informed.
For now, neither the Warner nor the TNT channel have communicated about how Hagman’s death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth in Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who knows the celebrity with classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave her birth in 1931 while she was married to attorney Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the scenes of the New York theatres in the early 1950s and served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
There he met the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he entitled his memories "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': J.R.)
“I haven’t written anything in this book that can hurt someone or affect him in any way,” he told the press at that time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist worrying patients.
"I advise them, I give them trust again, I come with them when they come to be operated and then," he says in 1996.
I’m trying to offer them a little comfort, like “Don’t be afraid, it’s not going to be easy for a while, but it’s going to be fine.”
He was also activist against tobacco and participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the "End of the World" has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew he was launching there an irresistible hameson: the end of the “big count” of the Maya calendar on December 21, to which many people refer as the proof of the end of the coming world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea of what was waiting for him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax hunger some called "the Armageddon of Debt" and an increasing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists of the end of time thought it was triggering the apocalypse.
“I didn’t realize that this would be the most apocalyptic semester I’ve ever known,” Professor Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey this week.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were telling it, it was a very good time.
And we must remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he is not the only teacher to teach on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
At Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vacker dispenses the course "Medias, Culture and End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetic scenarios guides some human conduct.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could burst.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real life examples.
“I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and her colleague Amara Solari, a deputy professor of History of Art and Anthropology, have teamed up to give a course, simply entitled "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world would not disappear," Professor Restall said.
Despite the "imminent demonstrator", students must study, create projects and spend their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not leave students any choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed world end," Restall said.
The courses have proved to be quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," Restall said about his high-level student course, consisting of 35 students.
We received email messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, on their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves,” says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at the University of Rutgers-Camden.
For the fear of Revelation, whether it is secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or the absence of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Nursing, says he has watched all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a class that teaches this matter," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interrogated, and even less a teacher, told us to believe on the end date of the world of December 21.
“Our first project was about Mayan prophecy, and in some way we discredited it,” says Julie Zegle, a 21-year-old, last year student at Temple, from West Chester.
The Mayans have never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I agree that there is an anxiety related to apocalypse in Western culture, dating back to several centuries, which causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a rise in these speculation.
“In other places in the world, people don’t think about it,” he says.
It is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answered when asked if he knew he was tearing on "the end of the world" here.
“The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world,” he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, we have spoken of the many supposed dates of the last judgment, and he states that if nothing happens on December 21, “people will immediately begin to think about the next date” or philosophize that December 21 marks the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many told us that they were thinking of going to "the end of the world" festivities.
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
