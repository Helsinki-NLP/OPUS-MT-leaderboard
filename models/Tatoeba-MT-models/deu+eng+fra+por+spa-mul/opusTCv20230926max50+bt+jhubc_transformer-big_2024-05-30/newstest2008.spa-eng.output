European inflation dropped in food
The accelerated inflation, registered in the eurozone, is primarily due to the growing price of food products.
The price rise in November has been higher than expected in the 13 eurozone countries, recording - after the 2.6 percent of the month of October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - announced the Luxembourg-based Union Statistics Office.
Official forecasts were only 3 percent likely, the Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike U.S., British and Canadian issuer banks, did not cut the basic interest, as a pretext that the decline, along with the rising prices of raw materials and the reduction of forced unemployment, would cause a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least about two percent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the trap 22: "There is to negotiate" on inflation so that it later does not have to intervene in this matter.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, registered in Germany, beat the twelve-year record; while in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation was shot in the eurozone as a result of galoping food and energy prices.
Grain prices increased by 88 percent and soy prices reached its highest level since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007, there was a lot more to pay for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil in the world market increased this year by 52%, reaching the black gold nearly $100 per barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from current 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent, but for 2009 will already decrease to 1.9 percent.
According to analysts, the annual inflation will remain in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by early December the support of the Young Democratic Alliance increased significantly, reaching its maximum level since 2002, while the Gallup never previously experienced such a low level - 13 percent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of secure party voters – due to the greater firmness of opposition voters – would mean more than two-thirds (a 71 percent) support from a fifth for socialists (a 20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Free Democratic Alliance would not reach either the limit needed to have some parliamentary scan: their support within the entire population is 2%.
Among safe voters there are one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the earlier lower point - it has never been so high, 41 percent of those who judged particularly bad the economic situation of the country, while another 46 percent believes that the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic as to the change of their own economic situation.
As for next year, the majority of the population has the deterioration of the situation and only one tenth expects an improvement.
In December, 71 percent of the consultants, higher than any previous Gallup survey, estimated that the President of Government rather does badly rather than his duties well.
13 percent of the consultants trust Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of the consultants.
54 percent of the population did not trust the Head of Government, and 27 percent did not trust the president of the Young Democratic Alliance.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control experienced dissatisfaction against the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October disturbances of last year 35 percent estimated it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, this proportion is currently just 20 percent, while the relative majority (33%) believes that the only solution is to hold new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the question about participation responded that they would certainly participate and another 20 percent said they are likely to participate.
In comparison, “general elections to be held on Sunday” would safely participate only 55 percent of the population and another 15 percent believes likely their participation. Based on the current intentions of voters, we cannot doubt the outcome of the popular consultation.
74 percent of the population would disapprove the payment of educational rights, 79 percent of the medical consultation service and 84 percent of hospital attention.
If we observe these proportions only among safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would refuse the introduction of studies rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has fifty-uped its prices
The average price level increased by 16 percent in the Budaörs gold commercial triangle hypermarkets, with the difference that this year’s VAT has not increased.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in Budaörs’ trade gold triangle the usual Christmas basket of the Napi newspaper, but in all hypermarkets there was a much greater growth than the thousand HUF.
As in December of last year, prices in food supermarkets had already been "disappeared", so there was no drastic percentage growth compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously terrifying for consumers the fact that what they could buy last year at a price much below the nine thousand HUF, today they cannot even do for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the studied hypermarkets exceeded at a minimum of 91 HUF the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(in 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but a strong increase in the filet of poultry, nut and poultry seed was recorded.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data from the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we also found a kilogram of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of the Coca-Cola with two-liter redeemable bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan’s basket it was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our estimates, with respect to last year's Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan with about 18 percent the prices on the Napi basket.
Comparing the most expensive basket values of last year with that of the cheapest basket this year, the difference has been 12 percent, while growth between the cheapest last year and the cheapest this year has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so during last year’s Christmas in prices felt the increase in VAT.
Just this was the process that destroyed trade, supermarkets were visiblely unable to make decisions on the price margin to apply for each product and to calculate the effect of the change in prices on consumption.
(If the trader poorly plans the speed of the circulation of a product, it may lose a significant profit in the margin that fits the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such ends as a result of the increase in VAT, which the most expensive was higher with 1720 HUF to the value recorded in 2006, while at the cheapest the difference was only one 844 HUF.
Such ends did not occur this year, since the highest price now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price growth was recorded in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets increased more than 30 percent the price of first-needed consumer items.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some first-need foods, recorded in the 12-month range a price increase of more than 30 percent.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to the Napi basket, in this last case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was registered, in the worst cases, just 10 percent of price rise.
According to all indexes, flour suppliers have a stronger position than eggs, imposing the drastic price rise even to multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the trade triangle of gold, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our collected experiences, most consumers from all three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all products buy large quantities, carrying the preserved food by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, in all three stores, large tails were formed in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that the sales volumes inside the country are lower, numerous multinationals complain to survey institutes because revenues are below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
In many hospitals you save with disinfectants
Several thousands of infections produced first by the improper application of antibiotics have been recorded in hospitals this year.
Reigning hygiene circumstances in hospitals, bed hacination and staff overload do not favor control of infections, says the doctor-chief department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it is saved even with disinfectants.
Not long ago, a MRSA infection has been diagnosed in the traumatology department of the Janos Hospital.
In a hospitalized man after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this hospital earlier this year.
A wounded in a serious car accident was high from the hospital and the same patient had to return to the hospital shortly after the infection with MRSA and since then an important surgery has not been able to perform due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Until December 10 this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection produced by multi-resistant agents have been registered in the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance, said Karolina Böröcz, chief physician of department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that this number of infections produced by multi-resistant agents has been registered in hospitals safely, and no information is available from the rest.
About two thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methylicillin-oxacillin.
One-third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their nose without causing any disease.
Infections produced by SA (e.g. throat inflammation, amygdalite, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once antibiotics are exaggerated or improperly applied, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics become very resistant to antibiotics and quickly infect in inappropriate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infections or sepsicemia, first of all, patients with transitional or chronic immunodeficiency, patients with weakening body, elderly or low-weight people.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the Yanos Hospital there is nothing special in the MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
Infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - Tibor Nyulasi said - where its presence is not examined.
Resistant to antibiotics
“These patients are isolated, nursing staff care for them in rubber and mask gloves and there are suitable antibiotics for their treatment,” Tibor Nyulasi said.
Hospitalized patients are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in your body, but even so it cannot avoid infection in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent MRSA hospital infections in most cases, however, current national hospital circumstances do not favor the prevention of training and contamination with multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and elderly households, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate nurses carrying MRSA in their body.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological samples are not fashionable.
This is also because the National Health Box does not finance these medical exams.
Thus, most cases come to public light when the MRSA infections already occur visible in the patient, said the doctor-chief department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes rigorous commitments for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological pictures.
Antibiotic therapy should be directed, i.e. microbiological tests should be done to prevent drug resistance from occurring, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Taking microbiological samples are even less common in the case of strolling patients or in basic assistance, Karolina Böröcz said.
Save with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is infected from one patient to another through health personnel.
Therefore, they play a very important role in washing hands, wearing rubber gloves and masks, however also in this sense, considerable lack in hospitals are experienced.
MRSA is infected by drop transmission and direct contact between people, however, in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often rotated, beds are often very together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, you can also experience - added Karolina Börökz - that in less favorable economic situation hospitals you save with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and that is why there is greater probability for the infection.
In Karolina Böröcz’s opinion, where appropriate prevention measures are met, fewer such infections are recorded or pathogens can be stopped.
Government Programme Against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA contagion is a huge expense for the National Disease Insurance Fund, so it is fighting against it in all countries.
In England, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
Apparently the program is successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show decline trend in England.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (among these MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative alcoholemia control of police commander causing a deadly accident
The official expert report on the case of the deadly accident caused by the commander of the police of the XXII district has been made.
It can be excluded the possibility that drived drunk or in a disturbed state of the since resigned police commander of the XXII district, who Tuesday attacked and caused the death of a transit, said Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Attorney General of the Capital, after the expert report on the case was prepared.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary alcoholemia control that had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic drinks before getting behind the wheel.
The then chief of the XXII District police station on Tuesday with his particular vehicle by bending to Kossuth Lajos Street in XXII District attacked a 55-year-old man who wanted to cross the street, but not in the pedestrian area.
(This last fact, i.e., that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Traffic Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give the step to bend.)
He lost his life after being hospitalized.
According to the police statement, the district police officer resigned and requested retirement because he had much disturbed the case.
The investigation of the case is in charge of the Budapest Attorney's Investigation Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the beginning collaborated with the prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
$400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed on Friday three credit limit agreements for a total value of EUR 400 million to finance infrastructure for education, transport and the environment, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance the Hungarian budget for transport and environmental protection projects, which will be carried out from the grant of cohesion funds, of which the parties had previously signed a credit agreement for a value of EUR 100 million, the contract which has just signed for the remaining 200 million euros.
The credit contract of EUR 150 million is also intended to finance the budget of educational projects.
The EIB approved in total EUR 300 million for this Hungary target, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be made later, by expanding the credit agreement.
The parties signed a contract for €50 million for innovations, which the budget will mainly employ for the project of innovations and research at the University of Debrecen.
During the conversations also covered the theme of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
It was agreed that when Hungary finishes with the EU details of Metro funding, the issue will be dealt with that if necessary or not to amend the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded in Hungary a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest of the credits is in line with the EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charge for keeping the credit available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of all Europe is directed toward that previously recently mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and those who buy on the even cheaper market in the EU, which will faster?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred goal for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe is certainly Bulgaria, with its cheap ski slopes and beach chalet apartments.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, as well as on the Albena beaches, the "Golden Coast", the "Coast of the Sun", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but increasingly more people seek properties also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will awaken the interest of real estate promoters and increasingly more people will buy properties in the particularly cheap area of Rus.
Likewise, the capital Sofia can be attractive, commercial and office spaces promise a quick recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradise in Europe, so it can be an outstanding destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the surrounding Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their lives and their way of living.
Most customers are English, but also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Maltese and Cyprus promoters are also present and traditionally there are many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and ski paradise.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups – says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who want to be installed here purchase new or renewed real estate for a price of between 50 and 100,000 euros or old houses in a bad state of between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them later.
They require good communication and access, as well as it is important for them the proximity of a big city, the shops and usually a local doctor.
The second category is chalet buyers (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 holiday destinations of Germans).
The third group constitutes real estate investors who make their purchases with the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital properties is constantly growing, since demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, these have suffered an annual increase of 21 percent over the past five years.
The increase in real estate prices significantly exceeds wage growth.
Fodor and the six hundred Hungarians
As reported by the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, expert-level meetings will be completed on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue minister-level negotiations on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world deliberate on the Bali Road Sheet that has the following efforts to reduce the emissions, established in the Kyoto Protocol, current until 2012.
Today, lively discussions are held on the particular issue between developing countries and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not want to negotiate accurate figures, although it tends to reach the agreement that compared to the 1990 situation, by 2020 the emissions of greenhouse gases responsible for the effect decreases by 25 to 40 percent.
Another major issue of the conference is that if industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are or are not willing to provide material and technological assistance to countries that need it.
Furthermore, an agreement was reached on aid to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a management board of 16 members, probably within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF) - writes the "Piac is Profit".
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports EU efforts to preserve its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its gas emissions by 20 per cent until 2020, with respect to the 1990 level, responsible for the greenhouse effect, regardless of whether or not the “agreement after 2012” will be signed and is willing to commit to decrease even by 30 per cent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to take their responsibilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries signed by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to decline by 5.2 percent, within that 15 EU member states committed to complying with 8% decline.
Hungary’s commitment is to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent over the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will fulfill, says the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
It is a lot that is at stake in Bali, since within two years it will have to sign the long-term international climate policy agreement, because if not, it is sure that its entry into force would be delayed to after 2012. In this case the Nobel Climate Reduction Compliances, assigned in the Kyoto Protocol, would not be immediately followed by a new international system of emission reduction, which the UNCC was added in its most recently.
Thus, the reduction in emissions would suffer a delay and could not prevent an increase of more than 2°C in Earth’s average temperature, which, according to scientists, would have unmeasurable and irreversible consequences.
The British Army Recruits on YouTube
The British army units in a video distributor publish recordings on filmed actions in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) took advantage of YouTube’s services: special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are loading videos about their actions against the Taliban.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in Kandahar’s overall operations body, then sent to London to be loaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
There are already 139 recordings from the soldiers of the air force that have been loaded on the Internet in this way and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defense registered in spring 2007 under the name of "defense headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions carried out in Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the Ministry of the British Nations Community (Commonwealth Office) and multinational forces in Iraq have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had loaded the videos with recruitment objectives, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defense also serve to present to the public the true goal of the British army’s presence abroad.
This type of propaganda costs almost nothing compared to conventional recruitment television spots - told BBC defense expert Gordon Mackenzie - instead, they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason of being the military actions decided by the government.
Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned that, in addition to the repeatedly edited and censored recordings, in the distributor also appear amateur videos, for example about the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda movies, a little hypocrites, officers talk to the maximum of losses, however presenting the bloody part of the fights.
Furthermore, the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan have been loaded to the Internet already numerous videos recorded in real operations, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruiting with free downloadable shooting video games, called America's Army, where in the middle of a more or less real situation the player can get directly instead of the soldiers.
Salted bubble and cake at the Christmas party of ministries
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of Christmas party, he will hold a work meeting for his colleagues who will be able to fire 2007 with salt cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its party with live music, in another one will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with a tumble and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so the power is enjoyed.
State offices are also prepared for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defense, but not for the workers of the Ministry.
On Christmas of the Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts and for Christmas of the Missionaries, the family members of the soldiers currently fulfilling missions abroad will be invited.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the holiday atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Foment Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (MET) will celebrate a luxurious party with respect to the parties of other portfolios
The MET party will be held at the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4,320,000 HUF and of the six hundred ministry workers is expected to have approximately three hundred fifty.
At the portfolio party will reign a Christmas atmosphere, will also act artists and there will be tumble draw.
ANF’s Christmas cost 4,700,000 HUF and was held Wednesday at the National Council of Justice (CNAJ) building with musical concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost a million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers from one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party that will celebrate a contest management company called the Hungarian Center for Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose, they rent the full building of the Theatre of the Comedy.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we have failed to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without costume
The CNAJ building hosted not only the ANF party, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated Lucia’s Day dance on December 7.
The CNAJ of them covered nothing for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister’s greeting words and after dinner there was live danceable music.
Answering the question of [origo] they reported: to attend the dance it was not compulsory to wear night suit or dress.
Health, work and local administration portfolios are prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400,000 HUF.
Instead, work minister Monika Lamperth is not waiting for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for a late-year work meeting.
It has the participation of a hundred eighty guests who - as the press department reports - will take only coffee and salt cake, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
Instead, the Minister for Local Governments, Gordon Bajnai, will simply provide with his colleagues at the Ministry’s class for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will celebrate a Christmas party in its own hall of acts with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - this budget will be paid for the reception with a buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers every year celebrate Christmas in the same way.
Instead, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the time of the afternoon of its celebration.
The agricultural portfolio will offer a New Year's Reception on January 20, in the Ministry Christmas will not be held.
The reception will be held in the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the 100 guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple reception standing, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief minister’s greeting speech and conclude with a modest food.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas party - this is what the corresponding press departments reported to [origo].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio, they were unable to report on the budget of the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the party to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathered together.
The League Unions and the National Federation of Labour Commissions will constitute a strike commission on Friday to coordinate the Monday strike that will last for indefinite time.
On Saturday a protest will be held, while on Monday - day the final vote on public health law - will be held - work unemployment will be started.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, since the rail transit will be completely stopped and up to 13 hours workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be in strike.
On Friday afternoon, the League Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike that will be held together with the National Federation of Labour Commissions.
The strike committee of the LIGA and the National Machinery Union will also be formed, which will coordinate actions on Monday.
On Saturday a protest will be held, while the participating trade unions will pronounce strike for indefinite time, if you don’t reach an agreement with the government.
This means that - on the day of parliamentary vote on public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the initiated strike.
If the National Assembly disagrees with the public health law, the unions shall immediately withdraw their call for strike.
Instead, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
Based on the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is also possible that only the public health law is voted at very night entry hours, or at least near midnight.
As a result of the strike to begin on Monday, there will be significant transport difficulties: on the railways will cease to work for indefinite time, in the morning a portion of the collective transport from Budapest and more than half the interurban bus transport of Volan companies may be stopped.
Simultaneously, there will be closed half of the roads at numerous points of the country.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some trade unions announced their strike for indefinite time, others for defined time.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railway and the Free Rail Workers’ Union (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on minimum services, although, as Christmas parties approach, more and more people travel on the trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day to 13 hours workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company, the Budapest Airports from 7 to 9 hours morning will take a four-hour strike from the LIGA Trade Unions to the Electrical and Thermal Energy Industry.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors will pronounce in national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Trade Union of the Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS) that are part of the Union Cooperation Forum will be held a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four lawsuits made by the League is that the government withdraws its proposal on public health reform and submits a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of calculation of pensions that will enter into force next year.
The third is that, even before 2010, in the case of advanced pensions, they will ensure the possibility that occupations that they deserve may enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Rail Workers' Union (SLTF) which is part of the League Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economics and Transport on the railway side lines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country the risk of the Hungarian Guard increases
According to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital, the Hungarian Guard’s activity, formed in August this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from several points of view.
The company’s “Risk Warning” writes: “In relation to the Hungarian Guard’s activity, the highest political risk constitutes the fact that “with the aggravation of ethnic tensions between the Gyptic and non-Gyptic population of Hungary, even in the short term, violent ethnic confrontations can occur.”
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard’s political strategy is probably the provocation of an event of this character, the representative of the research institute added.
They claimed that all this is due to one of the main mistakes of Hungarian political life protagonists: “The protagonists of public life gave him the public debate of the Citizen problem to representatives of the radical and extremist political groupings, who were able to found their political strategy on the existing differences between Citizens and Hungarians.”
This aggravates the problem, impossibilizes normal dialogue, strengthens extremists, and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts.
In addition to that, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international average, “deteriorated significantly the image of Hungary abroad, especially regarding the stability and democratic development of the country.”
They remind us that since the autumn of 2006, it has received increasingly advertising and boosting the reorganization of the radical and extreme-right Hungary groups and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organizations have been established in the country that are self-defined as "national self-defense associations".
“The common feature of these groups is that they are self-defined as civil organizations, while openly proclaim the training of their members for defense – even armed – (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), referring to the inability of the police, of the army, that is, of the state.”
They asserted that all this happens in accordance with the method that attempts to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the dissatisfaction of society with politics and with political parties.
Because highlighting the civilian and the form of association in the case of these associations does not only serve to avoid legal issues of legal enrollment, but is at the same time also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the Hungarian Guard’s activity is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighborhood relationships.
“In recent months, many neighbouring states referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-national political figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region.”
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works similarly to the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) of extreme right.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive disturbances of the Citizens that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to constitute the guard, with the argument that the organization's goal is "national self-defense".
In his opinion, in the past 17 years there was "Gitanic terror" in Bulgaria, however, the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has led to an animated discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic confrontations that certain Bulgarian Gitan organizations have announced that to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard so far has shown similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that also Hungarian Citizens react to the threat in a similar way by organizing their own self-defense - it can be read in the warning about the risks of the Political Capital.
Political Capital’s research director Attila Juhász to the news agency’s question said: risk analysis is one of the research institute’s activities.
As he said, they publish their risk analysis each year and when they experience something that can influence risk change, they inform the public, as happened in this case, publishing their warning about risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers.
In Hungary, the law accurately defines the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - that the next year will be less - work days are reorganized.
Neither in the EU nor in North America is party unit.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national party, state party and holidays.
The festivals are mainly related to religious and historical feasts.
We also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year, as the first day of the New Year is festive - this last, above all, so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven partys written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national party on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and on October 23, a commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the State Foundation, on May 1st, the Labour Party, on November 1st and 2st, we remember our deceased family and friends.
In addition, in our country there are two-day feasts of the Resurrection Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious parties rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often made bridge when there is a single working day before or after the party.
In exchange for long-term weekends, during the previous Saturdays, you cannot be exempted from work or school.
It is the labour minister who regulates in his specific decree when one must work exactly in exchange for the directly preceding or later day of the party.
This legal rule is of mandatory compliance for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
Instead, it is not mandatory for companies and services institutions who, due to their role, work uninterruptedly even during the holidays.
This year’s work order may be altered only around the end of the year’s holidays: from December 24, life in the country is practically stopped, since according to experiences, most people “does bridge” during days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year, several of our holidays will match mid-week or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First, the agenda around the work party will be modified so that then, for four successive days, the workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26, will be working day, so that in return Friday, May 2 will be a holiday.
The other change is related to the October 23 party: on Saturday, October 18, it will have to work instead of Friday, 24.
Instead, the next year during the end-year party will be able to rest, since from December 24 it will not work almost anywhere, nor even though the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little deterrents to bitter your colleagues’ lives
Emails we forget to send, sound messages we never received, innocent lies that pass us without realizing: they are all part of our everyday folklore at work.
You have to decide whether you adapt to small discomforts or consciously avoid confusing situations that can irritate others.
Advice.
I'm sorry, I forgot to warn you that you've been looking for from the marketing department," one of your colleagues says.
That's why you didn't go to an appointment?
In the best case, you feel it and try to repair the matter, you may call the marketing department to tell them that you have forgotten to give you the message (this is the least usual solution).
In most cases the matter is solved by apologizing.
Before proceeding to foolful explanations, it is worth mediting on the things with which you can bitter your colleagues’ lives and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There’s nothing more irritating than when you want to pick up a document, an office useful or your phone and you don’t find it.
Do you remember that yesterday you put the cracker on the table, but for this morning she disappeared?
Do you find your lost pen on the table of one of your colleagues?
Don’t remove anything from your colleagues without asking them, because they’ll be angry with you for suppressing their things.
Do not pick out or post-it from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they will be exhausted before time.
Chesms about your colleagues’ private life?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with who?
Where and why?
Don’t give everyone the information (conjectures) you have about the particular life of your colleagues!
Don’t abuse your colleague’s trust when he shares his intimate secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and don’t shake about your colleague in his absence, although others also know things about him.
Are you leaving a disease license unjustifiedly?
When you call the office by phone and say you’re sick and you’re unbearfully hurting your head, feel bad or good, feel that day you’re preferring to rest; think that others should do your job, your impossible tasks, your work for the end.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you won’t go to the office or may happen to you, so you have to stay at home, communicate to them, so that your colleagues or boss don’t have to confront your absence the next day.
Tarraeos, laughs, phone calls
Are you getting in your job, but you suddenly get your colleagues' laughs out of him?
Have you involuntaryly heard a phone conversation that would have been better not to listen to it?
Don’t bother your colleagues with your tarareos, songs, talks loudly (less when you do them above their head), scams, constant blasphemies, expressing your dissatisfies loudly.
All of these can be annoying, even though they’re not deepening at this time in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for an error?
Do not blame others if you haven’t finished something in time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or message!
Don’t refer to the eventually reigning chaos in the office, or the noise that your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the mistake!
Ask how you can repair your missing!
Do you feel too home in the office?
Jogging and shoes: Habit very comfortable for the house, but is not suitable for the office!
Do not look at a comfortable jogging even though your occupation allows it!
Don’t be unrelated, respect your colleagues and yourself dressing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation requires it!
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car goes slowly in the usual morning clutch.
It sounds a strange compas on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
Up the volume.
It changes the rhythm of music and the above tones is added the low and then the voice of a female choir as a true jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The national musical life didn’t maltrace us much with quality electronic pop.
But now this trap seems totally different when you’re listening to Zagar’s new album.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs of the underground [b2]digital [b3]national gradually change the image and although the rock style garage is again fashionable, breaks guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are novelties under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the whole of Yonderboi until he started his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to triumph, when he asked for soundtracks [b4]cinematographics (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The broader audience knew the whole that initially acted only in small clubs when the magazine wan2 selected its first record published in 2002 among the fifty largest national records, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend formator, able to sell itself in Western markets as well.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his whole are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether they have this tag tastefully or not.
The assembly reacted as it should react: it prepared a new and even better disk.
The newly released album, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the beginning years in the city of Pécs.
Because this title was one of the lines of the ancient set of Balázs Zságer.
It's right the reference on the airy, on the flight, but in addition to the airy of music, it now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album in the Millennáris György Ligeti, the singer currently working in England with the set of The Puzzle.
The album includes a true success of the mr2 Petõfi channel that last broadcasts from morning to night popular music. This broadcast led to the ears of the radiant's high-flight music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
Everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success, the question arises: what you are playing, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of selected audience for me means little.
In my opinion, there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can also be composed for sale only, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can arise from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of listeners also works with this spirit, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between receiving your music from the Hungarian and foreign audience?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially in the west of us, light music has greater traditions.
There not only the fifteen and twenty-year-old generations frequent concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are, and how many people listen to your music?
B.Zs: Naturally, I feel good to see more and more people attend our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
We do not make music for any purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience rather feels in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the unconceivable changes of the moment.
And however, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He worked alone and made his career rather the west of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow his way, even though they sometimes try to compare our music with that of him.
We rather work as a team, trust the other’s musical presence and let it develop.
At first it was inevitable to compare our work with Yonderboi’s music, since many of us started our career in their group and therefore we started another path.
hvg.hu: On mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love's list of hits is first.
Many people first heard the name of Zagar in connection with this song.
Have you consciously opened up with this style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to make big successes and sell our disc with these successes.
This song is more than that.
We add it to the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the disc and the heavier themes.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why just to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a choir in the gospel style.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of good voice soloists from our own national musical stage.
Thus was created that choir of six women - i.e. Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who was then baptized as Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you compose the song exactly this way or the girls changed some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed long ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material on the disc, we thought something was still missing.
The Acorde attracted the song.
Still that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
Everything came practically to the first attempt and incredibly spontaneously.
I remember, I was very excited then, but of course I needed the Divas too.
With my voice, I wouldn’t have worked so strongly.
hvg.hu: Both on the concert and on the disc seems like the girls were on the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay’s short only), they have no own paper, they sing all together and not stronger than music, so music not only accompanies their songs.
They are also on the stage on the bottom.
Deliberately?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply due to technical problems.
Instead, we consciously did not want to distribute papers of soloists.
The song also covers about it, that we should forget a while our ego, whoever comes from and where he goes, let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have wanted others to also feel the euphoric mood we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: What work did you devote?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually none, rather when mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want the groove to work and then, gradually everything went into his place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This constantly changes with the concerts and because I’ve already “sold” the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A traitor of stock marketer risks billions for its complex of inferiority
An unfaithful misleader.
This is how his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the giant French banker at Société Générale, also owner of the Czech Commerce Bank.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather like Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and without doubt with good capabilities.
He intuited long ago, unlike all major Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was heard from his superiors, the same who sent him to the police.
But what comes from Kerviel’s answers according to what the French media translate, such as the Le Monde newspaper, is that it was a man who earned more than 1.6 billion euros thanks to his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was making money for my bank," he says in his answers.
Precisely, in summer, he managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity has already seen her come early this year.
In February, some news was started to hear about the so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those customers would begin to have problems.
However, this crisis should not influence the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, his earnings exceeded €1.6 billion.
"When I already won my first 500 million, I didn't know how to notify it," said Kerviel and adds that nothing has been left for himself at all.
During the entire interrogation he declared that he had distorted the records in such a way that he could not reach his discovery.
He even deceived the bosses, even when the Eurex Stock Exchange began to be interested in their businesses.
The risk became a benefit
Did you be afraid to discover?
Rather, no.
“I thought I had won 1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would be happy to them.”
Where did you get so much will to risk in that way?
In my position, we should work gradually.
He entered work at Société Générale in 2000, exactly after finishing studying in Lyon.
His annual salary was handled between $51,000.
Two years later he was already a Stock Exchange Broker Assistant and in 2005 he became a Stock Exchange Broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still I knew I was never going to win as much as the others.
“In my first interview in 2005 I saw that they looked at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress,” Kerviel described the researchers.
But shortly from my entry into the company came the first big success.
Thanks to Allianz’s shares, he won during bomb attacks in London, playing down a title of €500 million.
And this was a start-up mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we leave you
"This is like a snowball," the police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew all of this or rather suspected it.
"While I made money, they closed my eyes."
Only then the coup came early this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase all the footprints.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros for its fault.
And how did they find him?
He became suspicious from his vacation.
“I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn’t have a holiday is a runner who doesn’t want anyone to take a look at his file.”
Czech Republic has the chance to get 365 billion
The government ministers of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can earn 14 billion euros (about 365 billion crowns).
It is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for 2007 to 2013.
Of seven operational programmes will be approximately 125 billion crowns for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to earn about 100 billion crowns of the Enterprise and Innovation Program.
Most of the money will be intended for transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of operational programmes and represents up to 22 percent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure that will count next year in the amount of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Business and Innovation program should serve entrepreneurs and businesses for the obtaining of resources in business innovation.
Companies should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly entered countries that least use them.
Twenty-year penalty for former President of Nicaragua, the court decreed
The Nicaragua Court of Appeals decreed on Thursday the 20-year penalty for the former president of the country, Arnaldo German, who was sentenced in 2003 for the default of $100 billion (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
Nevertheless, a while later, he was released from prison to pass to house arrest in his property not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Nothing is clear right now, according to the AP agency that, then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, will again be among the ridges.
According to the Chairman of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will rather depend on prison officers if they leave Germany to finish their punishment at home or if they get him back to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated how German was constantly transferring money from the government to a company account in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account actually belonged to its closest families and supporters.
Part of this money ended in the fund that German created to finance its campaign in the elections of 2001.
Thus we approved the budget.
That's right.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first elaborated by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year’s budget was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not be allowed not to accept it.
Apart from different debates prior to the vote on the government’s confidence vote, this time, nothing happened dramatic.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional view although the most influential, quietly passed the new law.
It's a great paradox.
Each government begins and ends with each chapter and departure of the budget, like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but there is hidden the rivalry of power between government and opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore they pay special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than just numbers.
The State Budgets of the latest social-democratic governments suffered from three defects that for this year 2008 it is not possible to resolve so easily:
The first of them is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as expenditures for representatives that are not only pensions but also social benefits that were approved last year before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, such as the municipal and community budget deficit.
Nevertheless, the highest risk is not in the deficit of the State Budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The watchmaking bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors to be able to obtain other investment sources, apart from the money of taxes, fees and credits from banks, often issued, without meaning, obligations to which they ended disproportionately to their municipalities.
In recent years they managed to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks that received from the state and privatization.
They currently do not have this resource.
If we only comply with the official and verified facts, we discover that:
Our economy, a few years ago, has gone through growth phases in the same way as the rest of the world, from what ČSSD is boasted.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to place order on state finances.
However, instead, the state continued to debt.
The other countries, except for some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to nations that within global measures we are less threatened by poverty.
That is why the massive social programs that, unfortunately, in recent years were uselessly swelled with giant measures are not necessary.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist expenditure approved this year before the elections, if the retirement age and pension reform soon won’t change then it will be the really end of any policy in this country and, who governs will only be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little we can say that ruling politicians will become officials, mechanical distributors of most of the money of retirement taxes and social benefits.
That’s why this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal spending of the spending of the representatives.
The planned deficit of over 70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the past government had not wasted what they could in the past ten years.
We don’t want politicians who rule to become officials only so we must be patient and give this weak government coalition, which realizes that the state can only spend what is capable of obtaining from taxes and fees, the tranquility for preparing other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State Budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial market.
In the Monetary Mark, more than $100 billion will be received by bidding.
In these tenders, banks raise the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send to license $40 billion, and then another $24 billion will facilitate the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks of different states agree on this coordinated process to protect and decrease the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, i.e., the continuous growth of the free capital shortage that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl, Economic Outlook Group consulting company, wrote in his report for customers.
"This coordinated action from central banks likely decreased the recession in the United States from 65 percent to fifty percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid credits, especially in the United States.
Economists are still expecting billions of losses.
“Central banks must really be afraid of what they expect even when they decided to take this step,” said ABN’s lead economist Kieran Davies.
“It seems that the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks fear they have the same problems with access to loans and therefore they will have to lend more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
Central banks thus decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR tariff, London interbanking tariff that is used for loan money in the interbanking market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money even when the U.S. Central Banks, Canada and Britain reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
“It will have the same effect as another interest rate drop,” Greg Salvaggio, Tempus Consulting, told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by central banks contributes to turning the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Environmental debates are amazing
Global climate change affects mainly developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again expressed himself regarding the problem of global warming.
The criticism emerged now with the closing of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his Blue, not green planet book, he commented that environmental debates are amazing.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations, but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that is used and reality.
“There are debates barely structured, they are artificial fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech President underlined during the presentation of his book that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy to discover his book translated into German because, as he said, "Many times I only meet the caricature of my ideas."
Now the stakeholders can be informed about their variety of opinions.
Klaus reminded him that he is not a climatologist but has, according to his opinion, sufficient assumptions to write a book like this.
He is academic, with ability to follow and judge a specialized disertation, has experiences with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closing he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are normal, that there is no agreement between scientists on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of current changes are not so large and serious, nor represent possible disasters, and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costly unsacceptable.
Furthermore, as a man experienced with totalitarisms considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
To the questions of the present he repeatedly explained that he is not against "reasonable environmental defenders but against militants who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits."
Klaus spoke of the same theme in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driving card
Six hundred thousand drivers were passed the date and therefore they failed to change their old driver card whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can apply for the change to officials from time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads without the valid card.
According to traffic, the card has not changed it mainly those who no longer even want to drive.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in carne change, the metropolis offices are filled with requests and the interest in the new carne has increased.
The City Hall calculates around 2,000 customers daily.
In the tails are expected half an hour.
In Prague, the new card has not yet been drawn up about 140,000 drivers.
The issue of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to apply for card issues within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who must change their card and do not reach until the end of the year, but will leave the roads without the valid card will risk a fine from January.
The offencer will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police officer can arrange the infringement with a warning.
In case of administrative infringement, the fine will amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, the person who does not go anywhere could receive a fine.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to moderately enter fines of a thousand crowns.
According to the vocal of the Transport Ministry, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driving card is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who do not want to drive should deliver the driver card.
Just bring it or send it by certified mail to municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the meat issued during the years 1964 and 1993 cease to be valid.
However, drivers should gradually change the other types of driver card.
People with the document from 1994 to 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million more documents.
Court reduced punishment to Berdych's complice detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complicit with criminal David Berdych will spend between 13 and 10 years in jail.
The Supreme Court of Prague decided as a definitive expiry the reduction of the penalties, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
Prague's department detectives against organized crime were going to fall, at first, between 14 and 12 years old.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the Superior Court.
Berdych is also in this case accused, but he first awaits the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
In other cases, it has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He can't receive any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the participation of 19 persons in the tract and the higher court, today, revoked 16 of them.
Most accusations of the accused were rejected by the investigation for being invented causes.
According to the Central Bohemia Senate, police members in accordance with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered the thefts, and helped criminal group members avoid punishments.
These criminals delivered 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The accusation relates to criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As regards theft, their victims suffered serious health impacts but are also accused of the abuse of power as public agents and without arms permission.
In the house record, the police found guns, steel-core ammunition, a laser driver, and a metraller.
The group of criminals, according to the allegation, stole tens of millions of crowns.
Except for nearly twenty men in this process, the court has already recognized Berdych and other accused.
Other men related to the Berdych case are still declaring other processes, and in some causes have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Půt and Maroš Šulej, who have for now avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their delivery to the Czech authorities.
One Account to Change Children: 12 Million
By changing a few children in the Maternity House, the attorney of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants 12 million crowns of compensation from Třebič Hospital plus trial expenses.
For each of the mothers, three million, for parents, two million, and for children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, does not in principle agree with the Veleba proposal.
"Such a demand we didn't approve it, it's too high," Dostal said after the meeting today.
“In order to make an idea of this counterproposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterparty ordered to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a rescisive value.
We keep in the opinion that it will be hundreds of thousands for everyone,” Dostal said.
The amount should be moved between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parents.
At the beginning of the cause, the family of Jabloň wanted, for every month they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba served as the basis to negotiate the compensation of the specialist’s report, only that it was prepared at the hospital of the Motol Faculty in Prague.
The parents of girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychic impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better supported by men although they were fighting with recruits for the change of girls.
Women take him worse with the trauma they are currently living and with respect to what happens today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses at Třebič’s Maternity House last year, on December 9th.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákově to Přibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
By the end of October, Vysočina Governor Miloš Vystrčil delivered 100,000 crowns to each family as compensation costs for the mistake committed in Třebič’s hospital that the region manages.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damage.
In the event of errors, they must remove from the reserve fund and they can extraordinarily ask for assistance from the administrator.
The court so far recognized them with a proportionally low compensation, the sums calculated according to the tables counting hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily one million crowns.
Polivka lost the kingdom of Valakia
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit on the Kingdom of Valakia brand.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava, he was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Valakia but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not present himself in the oral view today.
According to his lawyer, the cause probably has not finished and his customer will resort.
“The trial consists of Mr. Harabiš and his team being parasites of Bolek Polívka’s popularity,” said after the proceedings, Polivka’s lawyer.
For him, in the face of the words Kingdom of Valakia, everyone comes the image of the actor and comic.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
“We have been following about ten years of work.
Money search and invention of activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the trial is in money.
“After years I realized that the project is successful and that I could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work,” he added.
A profitable business
According to the court, the brand Kingdom of Valakia was first used by Polívka in its television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not about guiding him towards the creation of a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš was considered to edit the passport of the Kingdom of Valakia.
From that comic origin it was a business and a profitable business activity from which Harabiš then created the Kingdom of Valaquia society.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature on passports and even offered his owners discounts to his farm visitors and attendees to his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on stage for her own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valakia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team who were entirely dedicated to it.
The collaboration, among the today decomposed parties, continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized the official crown for Polívka in Vsetin.
Since that moment, conflicts began to arise between Polívka and Harabiš whose culmination came with the overthrow of "king Boleslav I, the elected forever."
The main role in the kingdom, by mediation of Harabiš, derived from the singer Jarmila Šulaková, as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an accusation against Harabiš and his society that has so far been rejected by the court.
Something clearly could bring in the litigation, the throne tournament with her princess, which is already preparing Harabiš.
The new king should come out of him.
He didn’t want to disclose more data or dates yet.
“We have no hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's path to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can present himself," Harabiš added.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: overcome prejudices
I never liked the Peugeotu 206.
Its gear features were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below the average.
But now there is on the market its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this, is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and to me, I just think of it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, of the space of the header in the rear seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense that I will not suffer from the two meters in length.
Flying around the world
I go through the inside quickly to not repeat it too much.
This is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here it would value the design invention although the car already looks quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained of short seats and backs.
Also unlike model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And the space?, and here you can feel how the body measurements have grown.
In the Combi, the above-mentioned shortage of space in the header disappears.
Bags to the suitcase
But the main thing in this vehicle is your luggage.
This must be appreciated as very accessible (thank you to the rear gate) and a well distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that are an ideal solution.
They do not bother, and can be extended to the point of holding heavy objects.
Let's stay in the reservoir.
According to the tables, in the basic regime it has a capacity of 428 liters, compared to competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the most sold vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW to the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find out that the Peugeot remains at the ground with its perceptible 52 liters.
On vacation abroad or by placing the child’s truck their value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I have to quote the floor that remains quite flat after pulling down the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our tested car was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition on a capacity of 1.6 l and a strength of 88 kW.
And to say this truth is how it should seem to be a 1600 who despised the familiar five doors.
It is silent, consumes little and above all has impulse.
If I compare it to the time of the Škoda then it seemed like the exhaust tube was tapped by a trap, I can say that with it I can be impressed.
Prices Respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, keep in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection lighting of 1400 by 329,900 crowns, is still possible.
Our aggregates put it since 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reachs another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbag in the headers, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen cleaning, automated rear windows...
That is, the car at all costs 531,900 crowns.
It’s a lot, but count on the team’s add-ons on the Fabia and it’s going to a quite similar number.
Now only remains to decide for which of the two brands.
Slovak students are not integrated into English schools
In English schools attend children from eastern European countries and therefore, locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans for now brings only a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between migrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children in British schools is very well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak migrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion and bronching among students have already reached even parents themselves.
The situation has come so far that Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was stacking sticks to a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense, she said the girl was insulting her son with racist insults.
Police also had to act after a two-year-old girls attack on a Slovak migrant.
The girls hit him with racist insults and threw him stones.
“When we went home, a boy approached us to the bus stop and started spitting.
When I told him that he would leave it made us the addition of throwing us apples and pears, and then he dropped down his pants and showed us his ass," he described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the Slovak student's mother.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with eastern European migrants as a fight for survival.
The above-mentioned cases show us how the environment in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your holiday can be accomplished as long as you choose properly.
Sandy and golden beaches, large waves or a quiet sea like a pond.
the palm trees and the whole enclosed with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on an island finds it much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called her, the most beautiful place human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and loading port of the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and led to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
He ordered him to build one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, as everything that was crime in the US (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high buildings emerged, on wide avenues run the cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a stock in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar had his yacht.
On the walls of the Middle Bodeguita left its signatures the stars of the show world and politicians across America.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita Abanense you can also leave your autograph.
At the expensive Hotel Nacional bar you mix the cocktails according to your wishes.
And those already worshiped cars from the 1950s, until today, continue to work in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat who have arrived for a long time have already oxidized between these wet and salt winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old neighborhood is deteriorating remarkably, there are no many wonderful colonial monuments in the surrounding area as well as there.
Other places are metamorphosed in beauty, for example, Trinity.
Because tourism brings so much money necessary, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguin and in islots such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and is highly appreciated by rail lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from immense plantations to narrow-road sugar factories in steam or electrical machines.
His cars for dozens of years have not been discovered and are now there, working machines and whose sibling models in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The best-known place for most visitors does not change.
And therefore, you don’t need to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the previously cited Hemingway property there is a museum that for those who are writer lovers, they should not stop visiting it.
The Valley of Viñales is the most picturesque corner of Cuba west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows in calcium rock lands.
Mogots, chalk rock pilons and high rocks scarped in the falls of the valley, and in their caves, fertile lands are acclimated thanks to which rockets are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where you will probably grow the highest quality tobacco in Cuba.
Visiting one of the pure haban factories you can meet your final product.
Perhaps someone seems interesting that there was the Chilean part of the series, Mayor Zeman.
Trinity
City of old abolengo that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought it fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with buildings in the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by French settlers later, has barely changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the saw of Escambray, is a place so apart that in the 50s of the last century there was no road that united it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay outside the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed, for every person was happy to have where to live.
If you have more time to stay in Trinidad than just one afternoon, it is worth getting to know interesting places in the nearby areas such as Ancón Beach or the valley of sugar factories.
The night belongs to the House of Music, which with its music encourages the silence of the morning.
Baracoa
Little town at the western end of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful of the island.
Surely that opinion is already confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantanamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as through a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been enrolled as a UNESCO World Heritage Site thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the Columbus cross (really it is a cross that came 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and now there is a hotel with their same name, you can see the mountains and among them the most known, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, pures, Sierra Maestra, the Bay of the Cochins and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patronate of Cuba, the Virgin of the Charity of Copper, Santeria, African religion that practiced the descendants of those slaves, of all, many pages could be filled.
However, as it is said, it is better to see it ever.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient necessary equipment are what is influencing the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to U.S. Defence Minister Robert Gates, should design a specific plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as thought, coincided in Edinburgh (Scotland) representatives of countries having troops in the southern part of the country.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, today, all eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week through its defence minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to increase activity, Britain sees as a priority to strengthen Afghan government authority and share development aid.
“The development in Afghanistan is palpable but armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The following is to enable the population to start economic and security development alone,” BBC said Defence Minister Des Browne.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels according to American army data is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent shares grew by 27 percent compared to last year, and in Helmand province to 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, fourth of which are in the south of the territory.
For the United States, however, allies have reached the same limit as to the organization and equipment of units.
They exactly demand more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
“We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary-General, Jaap de Hoop, also spoke today.
“I am not happy to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have ninety-nine percent of soldiers and teams we would need, and that’s little,” De Hoop told Reuters at the closing of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the attending countries in the last few months is the controversy of whether all all the allies make the maximum in Afghanistan.
For instance, he was criticized, for example, of Germany.
“The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in a zone of minimal violence and the demands of fighting there are not as high as in ours, in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The sensational newspaper Sun, this week called vague German soldiers.
"Afghan rebels discover that Germans are dedicated to playing while our boys fight," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British troop played a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will reach the billion in 2009
For each Czech, the state owes 84,000 crowns.
Total debt rose to 842,7 billion crowns in September.
This year the government planned to lend 159.2 billion crowns.
In early December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152,8 billion crowns thanks to the improved evolution of the state budget economy.
State debt of the Czech Republic grew to 842.7 billion crowns in late September.
In nine months this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, since June it has decreased 13.4 billion crowns.
Thus today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the debt of the state of early October.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state ended with more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems to be that thanks to the low deficit of next year we could pass the border of the trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between the 90 billion and the trillion of crowns," Patria Finance economist David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Next Finance economist Vladimír Pikora said: “We could spend the billion in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we still don’t know.
If the situation in the political scene was seen to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed by 2010.
But such a change doesn’t see it,” he added.
Doubt grows
The state’s debt creates debts in the central government and emerges, above all, from the accumulation of the state’s budget deficit.
State debt is paid by treasure bonds, state obligations, direct credits or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s internal debt increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
Foreign debt has grown from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion z crowns since June was reduced by 13.7 billion.
The average expiry of state debt increased by 6.5 years.
“The total annual debt from the first to the third quarter creates 13 percent, which is enormous given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated above all from obligations where there is a 20% growth.
It’s bad that debt grows, but on the other hand it shows that it’s going to negotiate until there is a pension reform,” Pikora said.
Better than expected
From the strategy of payments and state debt management for 2007 it is extracted that the government planned this year to lend 159.2 billion crowns.
In early December, the ministry decreased the plan by 152,8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement of the evolution of the state budget.
The amount is composed, above all, of the state budget deficit that this year will be 76 million crowns rather than the anticipated 91.3 billion crowns.
The rest consists of maximum planned resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency with about 13.3 billion crowns, the reserve of 10 billion crowns for pension payment, 43 billion crowns to finance state obligations and 1.8 billion crowns in loan payments from the European Investment Bank.
I compared today before a court to Jartum to have given a name to a peluche bear.
The British professor judged in Sudan for insult to Islam has been sentenced Thursday afternoon by a court in Jartum to 15 days in prison and expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British was accused of leaving students from 6 to 7 years old to give the name of Muhammad to a peluche bear when every representation of the prophet of Islam is unlawful.
It was passible of a punishment.
This 54-year-old British school teacher based on the Unity High School of Jartum in Sudan has been arrested at her home on Sunday and was charged with Islam attack and sedition under article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, as a result of several complaints of student parents to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually dates back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the class’s peluche bear.
"Eight names come out of the mouth of children, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in class, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as a favorite name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohamed."
The bear himself - he had no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the prophet's representation regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, stated that he knew her well and that he would never have done something that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I'm just sorry that he asked the children to vote for a name," he says it's just a "innocent error ".
Opinion divided by numerous school teacher students who describe it as " very attentive to their students " and " who never speaks of religion in class " ..
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most name given in Britain, it is written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (often given to the first child in a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
Wednesday they have not reached an agreement on the province's future status during the last negotiation session in Vienna.
In the end, the failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians ended on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last session of discussions without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region was " at stake," his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not foresee violence for now but enter a very difficult period," he added, noting that "obvious tensions exist."
End of the mediation on December 10
The mediators of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last go on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The 90 per cent Albanian province’s future could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last session of negotiations since the troika has been in charge of a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
Americans and Europeans believe their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked in the Security Council the granting of independence in Kosovo, insist on a pursuit of negotiations beyond this top date.
“Russia was and is committed to a negotiated solution, a commitment solution,” Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Declaration of Unilateral Independence?
After eight years of the Kosovo United Nations administration, Western people consider independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on an increased autonomy.
“Unfortunately, no agreement has been found,” Kosovo’s president, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden where these “last opportunity negotiations” were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has given part of his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan submitted by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to murders and deportations."
" Domino Effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic has for his part considered that a commitment was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province’s independence.
Belgrade says particularly fear of a " domino effect " in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this doesn't mean that a commitment is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that all decisions belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto right.
" Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word "
" Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanians would be made " in consultation " with the Westerns.
Bush starts an agreement between Israeli and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference gathered by himself on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a common statement.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately initiate negotiations in order to find a definitive rule of the 60-year-old dispute point between his two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them complete a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructure " and Israel must end their colonization activities, Bush declared, recalling both sides of their obligations towards the peace route they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would attempt " to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all pending issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This denomination covers the three main peliacute problems of the litigation point between Israeli and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the word after the U.S. President, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be "global and deepened" and refer to in all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things."
Upon his return to the tribun, Olmert committed himself to what the coming negotiations are "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to complete them over the course of 2008."
At the end of 2008, Bush set the end of the launch of his " vision of two " Palestinian and Israeli co-existing States.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had achieved an effort in this sense by Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endowed by all Arab countries, which proposes Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," says Prince Saoud in his Arab newspaper interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
Just like every time in this type of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the French National Police General Inspection (IGPN), a police car circulated on Sunday, shortly after 17:00, Luisa-Miguel Street, to Villiers-le-Bel.
"I was not in intervention but in patrol, and circulated at 40-50 km/h, without a rotary light," a police source explains.
A Kawasaki brand green motorcycle, "not approved, i.e. unauthorized to circulate on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated " to all gas " .
"He hit the police car on the left side, after a failure to comply with the step to the right," the police said.
Alcoholemia control practiced on vehicle occupants was revealed negative.
The state of the car (the unfounded front, cracked windshields, started shocks) testifies the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced to have entrusted an investigation for " involuntary murder and denial of aid " to the IGPN, cocked with the departmental office of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGPN investigation at this stadium discarded the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge, three witnesses of the accident, understood Sunday afternoon, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this minimotocycle came relatively quickly to their left."
Yesterday, a type of slot, undoubtedly caused by the frog of the footwear on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been embedded the time for the police car to stop.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
Bodies of both victims have been autopsied yesterday.
What happened right afterwards?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated through Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have left the site very quickly, not thus helping both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also remove " all serious faults " concerning this point.
"It is the aspect of the most difficult research, which needs more research, which must be very cautious," a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that just gives the scene.
"We go down immediately, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to reanimate them," he said.
There was nothing to do.”
Then he saw "a completely scared policeman, who shot.
Two others tried to reanimate one of the young people, the room spoke on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, to the certainty that people present from the unexpected situation of the young people, the police have been taken by car by colleagues who had arrived on the site.
Always according to this witness, the relief came "about twenty minutes after the police march ".
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
"I will not allow to assume that police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor said.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police suppressed on Monday the first demonstrations since the establishment of the emergency state two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, some 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the measures taken in the context of the emergency state have been injured by the tear granates used by the law enforcement forces, witnesses say.
These latter replicated with stone shots, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been appealed.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and injured lawyers.
Many would have been appealed.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court lawyers required a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 detentions during the weekend of opponents, human rights militants and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement gathered on Monday the support of religious parties grouped in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal whose president " urged the population to send flowers to the judges who pronounced against the state of urgency and the waste to whom they owed before Musharraf."
"Musharraf's promise doesn't fulfil anymore "
The Pakistani Supreme Court refers directly to the exception measure proclaimed Saturday afternoon.
In the next few days it had to be pronounced on the legality of the reelection to the presidential elections on 6 October, to the indirect supposition of President Musharraf.
Chairman of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been eliminated and replaced.
"Everything we attend is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court rulings," the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army's head and becoming a civilian president " no longer values " after the establishment of the emergency state, Tariq Azeem said on Monday to Information Assistant Minister.
It was expected to abandon its military uniform by November 15, date of the end of its first presidential term.
The assistant minister of information also confirmed that January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government dismissed insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy army chief.
More than a third of pregnancies remains unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Still today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancy is not expected, a study carried out by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalised contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Different contraception methods such as pill or sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates Ined.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed a better "domain of fertility", according to the institute pointing out that the pill usage rate among women aged 20 to 44 was increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Eight births out of ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated more or less a month for a couple out of five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will take more than seven hours of work in space for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his companions from the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a broken solar panel indispensable for the continuation of the station’s scientific activities.
A risky output that accumulated records due to its duration, its removal from habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "shaped" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday then that astronauts had released from Discovery launcher the Harmony module, a thick cylindrical piece in charge of soon hosting European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see chart).
This module is a type of landing walk for modules-laboratories.
But we have to be able to supply them in electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present at the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the reorganization of the module solar panels with a width of 76 meters.
And it’s where one of the panels, which are deployed as acordions, has been damaged in little or less than a meter by a cable that threw up.
The deployment has been stopped to no longer damage the panel.
The astronauts, who initially had a discovery launch control outlet, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to scratch at the end of the 30 meters length of the remote-controlled arm of the launcher added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best spacewalkers in the NASA.
High, resistant, very skilled, has the very developed torso and the long arms.
At the age of 46, this training physician has been responsible for "operating" the "injured" solar panel.
After inspection precisely of the damage, he sected the falling cable and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had helped the second " spacewalker" who had stayed near the air shuttle and, inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the commander of the crew.
The tool used, a mini-hockey basket wrapped with insulator to avoid electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been designed and "pupped" by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be completely deployed before making the inventory of its instruments and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts were taking advantage of a mid-day rest before today, seven astronauts return from Discovery launcher for the return to Earth scheduled Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned in exchange
The EADS action is currently in clear drop at the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defence group has announced that it will tend to spend between €1.2 and €1.4 billion to address A400M delays.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to review its forecast of the operational outcome for 2007 in response to delays generated by the slow development of the A400M engine, which conditions the inaugural flight of the aircraft.
The cost of pausing the delay taken in the delivery of the military transport plane, announced in October, is "between €1.2 and €1.4 billion of which more than €1 billion for Airbus," EADS said.
Due to these burdens, EADS will be forced to announce new exploitation result (EBIT) goals for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, adding without any more encrypted accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new loads is consistent with the delay of six months.
It should be remembered that the operational outcome of EADS failed 86% in 2006, essentially due to loads linked to the delays of another program, that of the very thick carrier A380.
Initially, the group provided for a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the urns: the Russians are going to opt massively for President Putin’s party, United Russia.
Confirming their aspiration to stability, even authoritarians, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today leads to voters a television message on public chains, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
It is the leader of the list for the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is revealed overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president didn’t let anything be transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new burden against the West accused of intervention – his favorite topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and wish honest, more transparent and more open elections, unincident elections," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
Denounced a pressure-shaped campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there is no "never had such dirty elections, even at the time of Eltsin."
After the repression of last weekend demonstrations, former jack world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, visits are prohibited, according to his lawyer.
“The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo”
Behind these unsurprised legislative elections, there are two much more open questions:
Who will happen to Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, on March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make them known.
Elected in 2000 and elected again in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
First Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful unified Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, for legislative elections like presidential elections, outlining power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they don’t feel the owners of their fate,” sociolog Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada Independent Center, estimates.
Historian Nikolai Koposov, from the State University of St. Petersburg, dates back further: civil society was delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin reestablished the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population because this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic disappointment," estimates Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "resign on their own will to the personal responsibility" of those who had briefly proved after the outbreak of the Soviet Union.
"What to reflect?"
The phenomenon touchs all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of the United Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name that the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion by Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: "What to reflect?
Those who are at power are not too bad, why change them?
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, Bad Arolsen’s Nazi archives, which describe the destinations of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million file documents, stored over 27 km of shelves to Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not until now accessible only for a "humanitary" purpose, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of an old victim or his righteous.
The eleven states in charge of their management – such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May 2006 to open them to searchers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow for research "particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the fields and the state of health of forced workers," explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Red Cross Commission (ICRC).
Until recently, several states, such as Germany, opposed the opening of these nominative documents to the public, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or the mental hatching of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or detention orders established by the Gestapo had been gathered after war for a practical purpose: finding the countrymen deported or subjected to the mandatory work and eventually giving them a test of their entering, in order to open the pathway to their compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees treat tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is a limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Center on Antisemitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free change agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade has already reached approximately €60 billion a year.
The European Union is India’s first trade partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free change agreement in 2008, said European Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
Foreign Ministers of the European Union had approved the European Commission in April to start negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade is already approximately €60 billion a year.
The European Union is India’s first trade partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the nineth trade partner in the European Union, according to the European Commission’s figures.
"A free-change pact will greatly doping both economies," and "India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," said Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. The Asian and European giants Duhan change annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "10 billion euros of services" in the presence of the European Commission, New Delhi, had stated the president of the European Commission's delegation, Danièle Smadzha, and the potential L.

Bank of England takes note of concerns offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The bank of England on Thursday was concerned to relieve the current turn of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds to the basic index of 5.75 per cent in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
" To alleviate concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks a greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its reserve contribution expected during the maintenance period beginning on December 6 in the form of an open market operation for five weeks, "
The bank requires that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market so on December 6 at 12.15 GMT, the basic index and until January 10.
It’s the first time it seems that the bank England BoE puts liquids on the market for five weeks in an open market transaction.
These are normally done in a week.
The BoE added in its statement that " it is prepared to take other steps to keep the indexes " of interbank loans daily in line with its basic index.
On Wednesday, the interbank rate was 5,829 per cent.
The index after three months was established at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums marketed by the Bank of England were combined with a significant penalty index that had dissuaded banks from resorting to that.
According to some rumors, confirmed by the evolution of the exchange of the pound in relation to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, the most advantageous indexes and with a more secure discretion.
UMP and NC matches deny the examination of PS match proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre group declined Thursday to discuss articles of the proposal of socialist law on purchasing power, equivalent to a dismissal of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist “niche” (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures taken by the national PS office on Tuesday, including the increase of 50% in employment surplus, the restoration of TIPP (domestic fee per oil products) floating, a check-transport or restrictions on rentals.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session has been lifted at the end of the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes alive, between majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy’s TV intervention on purchasing power.
PS leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amendment bill examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honour to work with a person who has inspired, not more or less, the current movement of the festivals in America,” Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival would take place from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Once known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the direction of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, then in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival at the Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn as co-owner was also responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury of “most inspiring event” to which he has ever attended, Charlie Jones from C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn’s company work parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and we worked with perseverance with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the center of Philadelphia City,” said Charlie Jones.
"We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we stand in low-category policies because of current administration, Charlie Jones pursues.
“Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and prepared to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional place that lately will tend to take place to Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after being demarcated in the landscape of the festivals in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross income of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in urban environment.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a camper festival, while ours are rather held in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give at the same time an impression of a camper festival in the European and urban manner in the American manner.
Vineland is more or less halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the conditions of the agreement, but states “that are quite interesting to allow investment in such an event and host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long lifetime.”
Charlie Jones says this festival’s hotel offer is “very big,” for example of the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival at Tennessee.
He says invitations have been released to the groups, but nothing could still be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
"Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His companions from C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood movies dishes to Montreal when nothing but Terminator is opposed to that.
This seduction mission is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounced the "runaway productions".
Is it hard to compete with the Governor?
“You have to be cautious, it’s the industry that decides where you go.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you're going there.
Our role is to offer those that will judge the best," he says.
The race to the festivals
For the moment, Denis Turcotte’s priority is nevertheless promoting the film here.
The race to the Oscars is started.
All the festivals in the West Coast, whether they are Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the cheese films, give them courage and make sure that the directors make interviews.
The Dark Age had a good picture of the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on a cardboard to Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
The experts, divided by the "subprime" crisis, will have a rally from the end of the year in stock.
Less than five weeks to fire the closure of the exercise, investors already rub their hands waiting for the traditional late-year rally to arrive.
This year, however, experts are not so clear that this will be produced.
Banif believes that "from the statistical point of view, the month of December in stock usually has a positive behavior.
However, forecasts should not be made exclusively based on statistics, even because in the current context, uncertainties are in the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not supporters of the trademark in the last few weeks of the year, these experts point out that “the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, ready to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the flight effect towards quality values both in long and short sections.”
Therefore, they believe that the bag will have a rather lateral behavior, not exempted from volatility "especially because the impact of the likely decline of Fed types is not known, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulation of inflationist tensions."
Javier Barrio, BPI sales manager in Spain, agrees that it’s not a good time to adventure to say there’s going to be a rally.
“It’s not the thing for many joys,” the expert says.
The Ibex has lost nearly 4% from the tops scored on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Still, not all experts have this negative view.
Intermoney analyst Juan Solana believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closest to the 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year on these dates.
However, the expert matters that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes the rally will be ahead of the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not consider volatility will affect the market trend.
Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, said that we are close to technical levels and “we could therefore see a rebound of the index that could be boosted depending on U.S. news as to the consequences of the crisis on the credit market.”
The analyst is confident that these are positive.
Analysts agree when choosing the values that will be charged with taking the Ibex towards new maximum rates.
Solana, from Intermoney, states that “this year is touching the great values.”
The expert would include the two large banks and some builders in the portfolio "because when the date arrives, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
In the meantime, Federico Olucha, from Inversis Banco, ensures that the rises will come from the hand of the banking and industrial sector.
Builders can also benefit from this rally, if given.
“ACS has been recovering positions for several months, and we hope that other builders such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow their same path,” the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increased sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do so very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only two occasions of December has been a bassist month.
The authentic late-year rally was lived in 2003, an exercise in which stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the climbing of the technological bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded a 6.68% return.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (for the moment the Ibex rises 8.36% since January) and if it manages to count on its rally at the end of the year.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renew much of his offices.
A total of 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a huge change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group that decides to jump to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 p.m., and open the Saturdays from 10 hours to 20.30 p.m.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that wanted to expand its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, he is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of Popular's experience will be decisive for other entities to or not point to this initiative that follows the timetables of the shops.
This is precisely the goal that is pursuing Popular with the project.
Capture private customers moving through these areas to make their purchases, to SMEs, autonomous and shops from the chosen streets to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling of existing offices.
For this purpose, the entity will modernize the branches already in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile that customers on the different streets present.
In this way, the expansion of schedules is accompanied by a different concept of the branch’s space and a new, more current design, with brighter colors.
Commercial banking manager, Angel Rivera, says that this restructuring does not constitute a great investment, although a greater hiring of staff, since it goes from having about six employees per local to eight or nine.
Offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three Madrid offices.
And the experience has been positive, explains Angel Rivero.
The Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Via de Madrid branches have been chosen, and it seems to be right, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others operating under the Mundocredit brand, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax premises, they will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of its offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero says.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobiles, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles the value for the first time in its rival Antenna 3 Stock Exchange
We've got it."
With that phrase yesterday he expressed his satisfaction, Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the closure of the market, when he found that the chain that leads doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect hindered his joy: "It's what hurts me, it's not because we've grown more, but because we've gone down less," he said.
Still, he emphasized that in a weak market, “we have fallen less.”
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an advance of 2.54 percent.
That gain places your loss in what we have been for the year at 15.66%.
The Stock Exchange value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and shared by Vocento (other 13%) thus reached €4.488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
His rival Antenna 3, which yesterday gave up 1.52% and accumulates a 40.5% drop since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of other quoted communications companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Prisa (Five Days Editor) and 1,779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is because we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we profit it in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year’s first television channel to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenues, said Giuseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary managing the group’s advertising.
If this announced data is made real, the television channel would record this year a 3.6% increase in its advertising billing over the 965.4 million in 2006.
Antena 3 net invoicing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to reach 734.4 million), while television net revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors analysts point to the best relative evolution in Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out that has maintained so far: in 2006, the company headed by Alejandro Echevarría divided 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says, although it is soon to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in partnership with its Mediaset matrix.
"We have the official commitment to giving at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, whom we have already given value with 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market gives samples at the moment of certain fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and by 7% in 2009.
They explain that expected income growth has been cut from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This same signature has dropped Antenna 3 profit forecast by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 reviews
1.
Ibersecurities: It recommends buying both securities based primarily on their high dividend profitability and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: go better to Telecinco (accumular) than to Antena 3 (maintain) for the 'multiple attractive' and business rise.
3.
JPMorgan: It recommends to underponder in both cases by having 'like threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force 1 November
Parallel to its parliamentary procedure, which concluded today by the Congress' vote on the amendments incorporated to the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of both entering into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by members and senators to negotiate and consensus the best regulations in order to guarantee the protection of investors and in detail regulate the activity of entities so that markets work efficiently.
The Mifid, which amend the Securities Market Act, entails the modernization of the financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and encouraging cooperation between the various supervisors in the European Union.
The new regulation will allow you to provide financial advice services to both specialized firms and natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advice companies (AFI), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
Furthermore, it expands the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are added to multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Law also requires investment services companies to disclose information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms on the market and requires them to keep a record of all their operations, to facilitate monitoring by the CNMV.
In its passage by the Congress Economics Commission, several changes were incorporated, including securitised debts are considered a "complex" financial instrument given their high danger to the investor, which has been demonstrated with the debt of U.S. high-risk mortgage (subprime).
Furthermore, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that diplomats in Economics and Business can develop 30 years after the real decree was approved in 1977 that delimits the professional functions reserved to economists.
On the other hand, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of the foreign party, will not require the CNMV authorization and may provide its product marketing and customer collection services to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonized IPC increases five decades in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the European Union inflation rate calculation, provides an advance of how prices in Spain evolved during November.
Its publication responds to Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) policy to provide time and quality equivalent data to those produced in the United States.
The advance indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modeling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of its publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the forward indicator is only orientative, so it does not necessarily need to coincide with the final data, which will be disclosed on 14 December.
"The IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
Second Vice President and Minister of Economics, Pedro Solbes, said the rise of 4.1% of the IPC in November is a "temporary encryption", but at the same time assured that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in Congress’s corridors that “although the figure is not good” Spain’s inflation difference to monetary union remains “more or less” the same in recent years.
He also explained that in November “there was less surprise” than in the previous month, when the government did not have such a high rise.
“We expected a figure of about 4%,” the Minister of Economics acknowledged today.
Virgin plans to raise 42 billion euros with Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock deposits have dropped over 50% to 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros) since it entered a crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time, he had record deposits above £25 billion, which has gradually dropped in two and a half months due to the distrust of its customers and despite the guarantee of the 100 per cent of that money that the Government offered and that will keep until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the entity with its Virgin Money financial brand, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenues in British banks that deposit over the next three years to achieve those remaining 18 billion pounds to achieve the target of 30 billion.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week the Virgin Consortium offer, in which three other companies participate, as his favorite to rescue him from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard has detained the current mayor of the Murcia municipality of Totana (the People’s Party) for his alleged relationship with the urban corruption frame broken this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the officer and the head of police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then governor of the municipality, last May, and that according to sources of research consulted by the SER Chain, it could be the 'chair' of this plot.
The officers continue to register municipal departments and Urbanism counsel and no further detentions are dismissed in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, leading suspect of the urban corruption plot that was destroyed early this week, has been accused.
As the SER Chain reported yesterday, the attorney of the 'popular' MP Juan Morales, therefore formerly, was arrested leaving Morales' home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galesian construction company to recalculate 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people detained.
Bono agrees to head the PSOE’s candidate for Toledo and chair Congress if they win the
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offering of President of the Government and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the PSOE list for Toledo for next general elections and to be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
This has been announced by the PSOE Organization Secretary, José Blanco, and the Bono himself, after the meeting that has held this noon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief of the executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best."
In addition, he has pointed out that "yes seems" that the manchego politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to chair Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace as President of Congress Manuel Marín, who made public on November 15 his decision not to attend the coming general elections and to abandon his career in active policy to devote himself to fighting climate change in the university field.
The former minister has acknowledged that the President of the Government has not ceased to insist in returning to the political avant-garde since leaving her two years ago.
Furthermore, he has noted that, as citizens know who the economic vice president will be if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will chair Congress, in a "act of transparency."
Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or scream" and make it "see the citizens increasingly."
"Sometimes unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid where you cannot talk quietly and quietly is Congress, the President of the Government once interrupted him in the Senate 26 times."
Also, he has had praises for his current president, Manuel Marín and “his good doing” and hasn’t wanted to see his position no longer to fall into what his adversaries might see as “prepotence.”
Climate Propaganda
Because the movement against climate change undertakes to persecute both the skeptics of its predictions and those that prioritize other political and social battles, it is obliged to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement who is president of the government as Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a “new contract with the planet.”
This approach forces you to explain why your Government’s action, or inaction, has decisively contributed to the leading Spain of the EU in Kyoto’s breach.
Who are responsible for failure, in which sectors it has occurred and why your Government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
Furthermore, it requires you to explain with the greatest clarity to the Spanish what measures you will take to stop climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizen habits should be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences it will have.
I mean, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there were neither such explanations nor there will be.
It’s just because it’s about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Cost, uncomfortable and threatening for business and individual accounts.
Even the cent of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seen Zapatero so dangerous electorally that he has hurried to deny it.
That is, it’s about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of all real consequences.
With stunning phrases, committees, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, that lord so useful for the electoral campaigns he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns mythes and inspires tenderness.
Whenever you are limited to being a merely virtual contracting party and do not want to move by bicycle or refresh with the range.
Totana Mayor and Chief of Local Police arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcia town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the town officer and an host businessman for possible urban crimes, today reported sources of the investigation.
The edil was arrested at its home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in which departments are currently located alongside numerous agents, who have also attended the Council of Urbanism and the Industrial Floor and Housing Municipal Management Company.
These three arrests are added to six in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid last Monday, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic soil in urbanization for the Galesian company Nuaria to build 4,000 housing, following the payment of illegal commissions during the past legislature.
Furthermore, two other people were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which instructs the Totana Court No. 1.
The first six detainees have been to court today.
According to the sources, the former governor of Totana and today’s autonomous parliamentary officer, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
Furthermore, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been imputated, like the current girlfriend of the former governor, who resides in capital Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the vigued attorney and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was detained in Nigrán (Pontevedra), just like Pablo José M.G., director of Inmonuar Floor, an agency integrated in the cited Group, and through which the bribes would have been held.
The investigation is carried out by the Civil Guardia Central Operational Unit (UCO) Urban Crimes Group, whose agents, in addition to detentions, practiced eleven records, mostly in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
One person was then arrested in Totana, in particular, the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the region, who could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing the largest residential complex in the Murcia municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two "spa" hotels.
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that were requalified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to the promotion of real estate; Conycase, which manages the viguese parkings of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this yesterday's comment in Finland's most important newspaper (for example in the head of the PISA report on educational level in the world), Helsingin Sanomat, who refers to what they published on November 18, on the same day that it appeared there, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
“The content of Philosophy’s signature has jumped to the public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela’s school.
The guilty of the deaths, a bachelor’s student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Philosophy Education Councilor Pekka Elo demanded from the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that teachers take a critical attitude towards Plato and claimed that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy at institutes.

A colleague passes information about the introduction of the Criminal Code of Internet Download Crimes:
A. The download of a song would be a crime with penalty from six months to one year.
Instead, if you steal discs from the store at a value of less than 400 euros, it is simply considered to be missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal in the store up to 1,000 euros, the theft is already criminal, but the penalty remains less than the discharge imposed (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains lower than that of the discharge (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous ridge has a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
The distribution of copyright-protected and unauthorized movies by the authors is more punished than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).

My head doctor leaves me one of his articles on rare research entitled: "Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less."
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly payment of workers depend on what the colleagues earn.
The study has been carried out by tomographic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest number of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Life&Brain Institute’s Neurocognition Image group, Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded properly and his companion failed.”
The researchers noticed that if when both were right, they received the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one received twice, activation was greater.
I don’t know if it required so much science this conclusion.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has implacablely pursued Balkan war criminals from the prosecution of the former Jugoslavia Criminal Court, located in the Hague.
His mandate ends at the end of the year and Carla will go with a sweet taste, because the main responsible for the killing of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Muslim Bosnians died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbo-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic, remain free.
His names are on that list of which takes his title the documentary of Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, 'The List of Carla' (2006, not released in Spain) who, with the pace of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the fleeed criminals and pressure the governments involved to close.
What insurance is suitable for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible sinisters, involves a significant expenditure that will depend on various factors such as age, gender, card age, civil status, vehicle type to be secured or use, among others.
Having the car is only the beginning.
And it is that choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we must be aware of what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is undertaken in an insurance agreement, which states that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being held responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a failure.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors such as age, gender, card age, civil status, the type of vehicle to be secured or the use of this card, among others.
Insurance companies establish their prices based on statistics, so that the greater likelihood of suffering from an accident, the greater fee to pay.
That’s why both older than 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics reflect that they have a lower rate of sinistrality due to their prudence.
Also, taking hand on the counts, companies have come to the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thereby the likelihood of having some kind of percance.
By increasing frequency, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
This is why the driver has to study the situation well to choose that car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will explain here the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that this, in addition to adapting to the features of the insurer, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 encounter several disadvantages in hiring insurance at an affordable price, such as the reduced driving experience and card age.
Although the ideal thing to be insured is a full-risk insurance, there are other cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for a full risk with franchise, so they get coverage of a full-risk insurance but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would suppose the customer to pay a portion of the amount of the sinister.
“The part of the amount of the client’s damage will be pre-established based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount is,” says Luis Noguera, the top responsible in First Europe Spain, online insurance mediator.
Another option is an expanded third party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection from damage caused to third parties, although not from those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A counsel.
If you are under 25 years of age, you try to be careful and avoid sinisters as much as possible, as this will impact the bonus, and can reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the company’s base rate.
On the contrary, a penalty is a recharge on that base rate.
“Bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of it.
If the company has had a good year, it can be allowed to increase the bonuses,” Noguera explains.
After the 25-year-old strip, drivers are easier to hire insurance, as the sinistrality rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommended thing is to hire a whole risk with franchise.
“Usually young people cannot make use of the experience previously acquired in a crash, and even at driving time,” says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the fear of the newborn already passed.
However, if the customer is married but still has no children, it is preferable to trade a full-risk insurance as long as its economic situation allows it, of course it is.
On the other hand, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lower rate of sinistrality, so the charges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be one at all risk with franchise (may be €300), or, where available a high level of bonus, one to third parties expanded from the third year of the vehicle’s lifetime.
“They are conducting a more relaxed drive and have greater purchasing power to allow themselves to take over a larger amount of franchise,” Luis Noguera said.
For retirees, a full-risk insurance is recommended with franchise (being €150), or one to third parties expanded when you have a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible sinisters, but also because it represents an important expenditure, which is why it is essential to adequately study the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
The Celtic is looking for a point worth the eighth in Milan
Milan and Celtic are measured on Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the Champions ligue, as the Italians serve to be the first and the Scots to sentence their classification.
The Italians add ten points and already certified their pass on the fifth day with an empate in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, and he receives the Benfica, who has four, doesn't go ahead.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the entire sixth day ends, as Milan has to play the World Cup of Clubs in Japan, where it debutes on 13th in semi-finals in search of a square for the final of 16th.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest of the Giuseppe Meazza seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go out for a victory, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would remain first and secure a better cross in eighths.
Gordon Strachan could serve even a defeat to classify itself if the Shakhtar does not win, but it cannot be trusted because nine-point equality the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1) but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to bitter Scots at night, who trust to get eighth for the second time in the restructuring Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round the past campaign with a Kaka goal in the prolongation (1-0-0) after 0-0 of the trip.
Waiting the victory of the Rossoneri will be the Shakhtar to whom only the triumph is worth, in the event that it loses the Celtic, both to get into eighths and to continue in UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the highest European competition, could reach the third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend Vancouver to the first Spice Girls tour
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, with about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver.
About 20,000 people exhausted the tickets to witness the concert that included a video that tells the story of the group that made anger in the late 1990s.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects its main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain releases EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls went to the stage, looking at bracelets that had given them the husband of Posh Spice, British football player David Beckham.
The athlete was among the audience overthrowing the GM Place, even though Victoria’s nerves had been forbidden days earlier.
In the previous start of the show, Victoria Beckham noted that the British star “has not seen our clothes, for nothing, so I’m nervous about what it’s going to think about the show.”
'Sporty Spice' whose exit from the group in 1998 "for the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the quinteto two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the show started.
"I was frightened.
I was nervous but I saw the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm happy to have made the decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been fixed and loved us very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girls last acted together in 1998.
According to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon arrival at the airport, I expected them an army of babysitters.
Among the five are seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will act in California (U.S.), San Jose (December 4), and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
In Madrid they will act on December 23.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute for the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it affects Russia’s export of fuel to Western Europe.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each sprinkling between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the gas price, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, monopolic gas owner, Gazprom, trying to agree the amount of money Ukraine owed to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it will charge Ukraine more as it has committed to paying an extra 50% in 2008 for the gas coming from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it might be that Ukraine will pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
“It’s important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transits during the talks,” Ukraine’s Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters.
"Changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments on the levels of transit rates [toward Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly raised prices.
Russian gas represents a quarter of the EU’s supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations of Central Asia.
NHS "must test foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to control the criminal background records of employees outside of Europe, a vigilant said.
General auditor Robert Black’s recommendation came after it was found that a foreign physician was related to the Glasgow airport attack in June.
Black also showed her concern that the Scottish NHS has no accurate idea of the amount of foreign staff it counts.
However, his report pointed out other controls that are carried out properly through a sample of five health authorities.
The general auditor checked the number of foreign personnel hired outside the European economic area following the attacks on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Paisley’s Royal Alexandra Hospital, was arrested at the airport after a jeep shock at the doors of the airport’s terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who acted at the Old Bailey video conference in October, accused of alleged bomb car attacks in the UK.
NHS expects to carry out pre-employment checks for candidates to ensure they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although the Scotland Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of Britain.
The general auditor’s report recommends, among other measures, that boards should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
“Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review,” the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but points out that "our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of foreign NHS staff."
Scotland’s BMA president, Dr. Peter Terry, said it was “very unlikely” that pre-employment checks can identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is unclear what the added value of the recommendations made is," he said.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreigners, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the general auditor warned that the number may be higher, partly because the boards have trouble identifying who employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the check procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being broadly performed.
This includes passport checks, work permit and qualification check.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing foreigners’ pre-employment policy and guidance in the NHS.
Secretary of Health, Nicola Sturgeon, said: "He had a great interest in this work to be carried out following the Glasgow airport terrorist attack.
He added that the Scottish government, together with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups – including foreigners – what they had planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards
Control, the biographic film about late Joy Division vocalist Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for the best film.
The trophys were also given to protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-protagonist Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named best actress for the thriller "Notes of a scandal".
And the protagonist of Bond, Daniel Craig won the variety award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were delivered at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows the rise to Curtis' fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film – black and white – which features soundtrack from The Killers, David Bowie and New Order – was produced with just 3,000 pounds.
But the Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic character of the album Joshua Tree of U2, awarded two awards--best director and best debut director.
The rock music was the center of another award-winning ceremony – like Julien Temple’s movie on The Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, won the prize for the best documentary.
The award for the best actor took him Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a London Russian mafia chief in David Cronenberg’s Eastern Promises movie.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation to play hard, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British film.
The fifteen, whose movies include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming Indiana Jones' sequel "The Kingdom of the Glass Cave".
Winstone said he was proud to receive that prize, named so in honor of Harris, Camelot star and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
“I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it’s really an honor.”
The independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team including filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa festival sympathizers and mecenes include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia said he arrested 208 terrorist cell militants planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television from the world’s largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have set up a campaign against local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents planned an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, the television report said.
Saudi Arabia created a 35,000 force to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the world’s largest oil plant, after a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said that 18 of the arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert" who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned the smuggling entry of eight projectiles to the country.
Other 22 of the detainees were planning killings of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders to be more active to stop the Saudi people traveling to Iraq to join Al-Qaeda as militants to fight the allied forces and to support the Shiita Muslim government, which is considered heretic by the most extreme Saudi Sunni.
Al-Qaeda militants look at many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - recruited by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda born in Saudi Arabia, to harass the pro-western government - had goals of residences of foreigners associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a huge effort from the security forces, for five months of work," the spokesman of the Interior Minister told state television.
The arrests also include a "media cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose objective was to promote "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes other 32 people accused of financial support and support to the militants.
Venus climate can give an idea of the future of Earth
Venus might once have been an appropriate place for life, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European orbit spacecraft showed the planet more like a Earth twin than previously observed.
Venus is the planet closest to Earth.
The two planets have similar size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made the Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, the atmospheric erosion of solar radiations and the slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for the Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a picture of how the Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "It is clear why the climate in Venus is so different from the Earth, when two planets are so similar.
“Our new data make it possible to build a scene where Venus began like Earth, possibly with a living environment millions of years ago.”
Police decommits "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, which they declare is enriched uranium, was dismissed yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000 Sterling).
Still remains open
Mitt Romney says it’s not worthy for presidential candidates to answer a snow monkey’s questions.
However, Republican candidates for the presidency eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, where common and common voters record video questions and send them for their dissemination among candidates.
None of the questions presented on Wednesday afternoon November 28 were more ridiculous than the snowmallow who asked Democrats about climate warming in the YouTube Republican Party’s debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party faced next year’s elections.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-patrocinate the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates to aspiring.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest dedicated to a single issue, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for the Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecisive voters to climb the dial when they heard ideas that would please them: the issuers noticed peaks of approval when the candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The hardest night speech exchanges occurred between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pointer in the crucial surveys of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation because he was soft with illegal immigration when he was Mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked whether any candidate could support an "amnesty" (by allowing illegals to regulate their situation and giving them the possibility to obtain citizenship).
Small candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, agreed on the issue.
No one has the word to be nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because they both warned about the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with the fear of China’s toxic toys and other foreign concerns, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had supported weapons control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked if candidates believed in every word in the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to fall into the position that even though the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first in the most recent Iowa survey, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressed to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too intelligent to be a candidate in the election.
The race remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is increasing in Iowa, coincidentally with liberal Ron Paul’s fundraising campaigns, and his warm statements from Wednesday’s debate.
They have both left from the bottom because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the early and convincing party with a winning message about America’s greatness, satisfying both of the party’s wings.
This time the match is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labor Dolores
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole to sink, but equally emerges.
As political scandals remain in England, this is not particularly interesting.
It does not seem to have sold influences, nor is it about exorbitant hotels accounts in Paris, nor is it about extramarital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a rich businessman has disguised contributions to the English Labour government party, of more than £650,000 ($1.3 million), for about four years using false names, and that the party did not condemn it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister declined to call an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence declaring that opinion surveys did not influence his decision, hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads increasingly ingenuously, because the feared Mr. Brown has moved from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble, demonstrated regulatory weakness and trial poverty at crisis times.
Poor proposals to change the tax code have put business groups together against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unthinkable administrative chastisement.
A trio of retired generals started a strike in the chamber of the Lores, protesting against cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a half-time employment.
Now they are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour Secretary General (and previous complice) has already resigned.
None of this means Mr. Brown is irrevocably walking towards the exit.
Governments can reach a bending point after they are unable to govern.
People don’t believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their unbelief when a new batch takes control.
Once it is clear that the Prime Minister cannot improve things, which doesn’t leave a lot of time, that suspension is more: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press seeks bad news; and the government goes to defense and does not focus.
On the one hand, Brown’s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, it cannot defend itself by arguing it’s new.
Although he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his senior Lieutenant.
The Northern Rock issues and authority registration tax are related to the decisions Brown made as a chancellor of the erary.
And even though it’s not directly wrapped in Blairish’s contradictions – or “partner-effective,” the research of the financing of the political parties – voters can assume that if it’s.
However, Mr. Brown’s situation is not as bad as it seems.
Irons are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
Like Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor has been scammed directly.
And the remedy, although painful, is to give what Mr. Brown’s naturally Stalinist trends have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with charity gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his kindness.
This may be like that, but the decision doesn’t make it he.
The laws against anonymity for major political taxpayers are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abraham’s agreement, and that he was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the chief of fundraising who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown so far is not involved: there is nothing he suggested knew about these performances, although the thickness of payments was done after he took control of the office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the job.
It has been quick to condemn its party for violation of the law, but it is diluted in decision-making by a family matter, a committee of investigation on the matter - to a large extent conducted by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police matter.
Furthermore, there are other things that Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent chief for the Public Life Rules Commission, as he has not had one for six months, and he must also pressure for a genuine reform of the financing of the parties.
This will require a harsh cooperative work of the Labours with the Tories, and perhaps a resignation of the special financial situation with the trade unions - agreements for a party like Mr. Brown.
But he must deal with some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in surveys; he is two years old to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probability and strong competition.
Card sharks
The mortgage crisis subprimes is infecting the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that dorsal flaps swim excited around.
Today, when the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their looks on the country’s market for credit cards.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis contages other forms of consumer credits.
Signs of contagion are already seen.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million in its American consumer funding business, partly due to the weakness of card borrowers.
However, it’s very early for panic.
Morosity and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, in the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in American bankruptcy law (2005) led to a sudden fall in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, of morosis) would grow again, or may happen that conditions for borrowers were worsening.
The industry also reports strong payment rates, which show how much of their debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed securities is quite firm, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney from TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that emission volumes for 2007 will be nearly 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of the crisis infection between the subprime mortgage and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are expiring.
But credit card issuers look at the liquidity flow more than the asset securities, so that falling prices don’t necessarily cause a change in borrowers’ credit capacity.
They can even work to advancing the issuers.
Incentives for consumers to continue to amortize mortgage decreases if properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, payment of the card’s debt goes on the list of priorities.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage loanmakers, changing interest rates or altering creditor balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of fast asset retaining.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and assess all the loans again,” says Gary Perlin, Chief Financial Officer at Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a credit contraction push America to recession, the industry is undoubtedly facing a more severe future.
We need to keep watching those dorsal flaps.
British bankers declared guilty in case of Enron
Three British bankers who went to trial for their responsibility for fraud with Enron’s former chief of the financial office, Andrew Fastow, were convicted Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven fraud charges for colliding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich at the cost of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. district, each was sentenced as guilty of fraud collusion.
The three former Greenwich Natwest executives, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became a famous question in Britain for extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, his case marks the slow end of an investigation launched after Enron’s collapse in 2001.
Initially, charges against bankers were to have warned Fastow in 2002 that it was a goal of government investigation on Enron’s fall.
The accusation against the bankers - doubled the "NatWest Three" - claims they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former senior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a Fastow-controlled Enron society, which was the artist of a myriad of Enron fraud, which helped his falling spiral in failure.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the subsidiary in zero, but the three British knew it would value in rise.
A company under Kopper’s control bought the subsidiary’s bank interest in $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the allegation, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million were left in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers charged 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the accusation.
In January 2004, Fastow was sentenced guilty for two conspiracy charges in Enron's collapse.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is fulfilling a 6-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is complying with a penalty of 3 years and a month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay a million dollars they required to live in the United States while the trial was held.
Enron, one of the nation’s seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of tricks in accounting, couldn’t hide the debt of millions or make their businesses seem successful.
The collapse lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market securities and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron’s founder, Kenneth Lay and previous executive chief Jeffrey Skilling were in charge of their roles in the company’s collapse over the past few years.
Skilling is complying with a conviction of more than 24 years.
Lay’s conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the wealthy Russians.
“It has a capacity of up to 18 passengers,” says Dan Firer, Gulfstream representative.
“But no one ask for that model of so many seats because it’s for family private flights or for presidents of a company.”
Mr. Firer was responsible for Gulfstream’s cabin on Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day consumption orgy held at a center of events near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had installed their display stands, hoping to attract new Russians to all kinds of products, from caoba-crafted yachts to diamond-embedded car grills, worthy of 50 cents.
Mr. Firer cautiously looks at a bright orange Porsche on the neighboring stand to his."
"It's a beautiful car, but it's nickel and boiler compared to us," he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft.”
Fuel-provided by the oil rise, the Russian capital resembles Dallas when it was in peak.
“We lived the same in 1890, when some acaudate Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists,” says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University.
“Like the Saudi Arabians of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world’s largest consumers and spenders.”
The most exclusive luxury brands in the world are looking for their part of the cake.
In another place in Moscow, this week a conference on the luxury industry will be held with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and LVMH President Bernard Arnault, to exchange ideas about how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of richest people.
Furthermore, the wealthy of second grade include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists of the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think thank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below the livelihood level.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – and that’s why we’re all here,” says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of David Morris, London’s jewelrymaker.
She attends the trade fair for the first time alongside the Russian brand distributor, the Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are perfectly prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the fair Sunday night, dressed in afternoon suit, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and themselves as millionaires.
“I looked at the cars and I’m trying to decide between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” Yumatova said, who reeled off the design suit that wears like a red carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum cuttings, Mövenpick ice creams, custom pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears.
The general public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44.57 dollars).
“The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who sits patriotically on a stand of the real Dutch Delft porcelains, in front of a wall size reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting made of hand-painted tiles.
“Of course, the Russians are more interested in ‘bling-bling’.
In fact, sellers said that the rich Russians of more trajectory (10 to 15 years, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from the calling logos to limited editions brands, which would not be exposed to a trade fair.
Nevertheless, several thousands of people: cash millionaires, millionaires issuers or tourists, fill the halls every day.
Some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director general of King Koil beds, said he sold two mattress systems of $70,000 each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton entertained with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales officer for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, L.A. Connection’s president Andrei Karapetian, a customized luxury car modifying company, said he had sold three chain-shaped car grills for Rolls Royce Phantom, at $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with embedded rays of Swarovski colour crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
“The Russian millionaire who wants strush leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes will not necessarily drive on those wheels,” Karapetian says.
"He's going to keep the car in his garage, alongside another 30 or 40 cars."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase "Russian billionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the wave of real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if it's not in cash," he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich for the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red phone cabins (British style) filled with one million dollar fake banknotes.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped shaking stacks of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobiles while resting on lots of money, or packing a couple of millions.
“You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” says Karryev.
Chirurgie may cause death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the restaurant window "A little healthier" and saw an ambulance climb through White Cape Cod, two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car came up.
And then another.
"Then I saw going up the ambulance," said Mr. Livingston, supervisor of the restaurant on Wednesday.
"It was when I knew someone had died."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was 41-year-old Olga Arroyo, assistant of the Newark police officer.
Now researchers are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure carried out by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works at the house of West Scott 212.
Authorities still don’t determine what caused the death of Mrs. Arroyo, but expect the toxicological test although the results will not be available until a few weeks, which will help resolve the mysterious death that has punished on the top rows of Newark’s police.
Ms. Arroyo had been the assistant of police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
“She was loyal, worker and tenacious,” McCarthy says about Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She protected me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Drink Control Commission, and who left two sons 14 and 11 years old, and a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsh, county prosecutor’s spokesman Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died following an unauthorized surgical procedure.
“That’s one of the possibilities,” Walsh said.
"It's a ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at about 3 p.m.
On November 21, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
He was declared dead in place.
It has passed more than a week and the authorities have said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, named Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not say if Mrs. Castro has been interrogated by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one responded to the door in the home of Mrs. Castro, where a little rose is located on the front of the house, and a thief Dalmatian on the back.
A blue drum labeled as "vainillin ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was on the door of the carriage, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hanging from hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of an invaluable help in meeting the new island city and her rude political culture.
“She would say, ‘You have to watch with this or that one,’” he said.
“She was always here when I was, and when I didn’t.
It's embarrassing."
Federal reserve is expected to cut fees to raise the exchange
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to soothe credit conditions with cuts at interest rates, which increased with the calming comments from the vice president of the U.S. central bank.
The scholarships were released in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, president of the reserve, declared that policymakers should be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continued tension of the financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid growing samples of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said recent turbulence was "in part invested by market improvement by the end of September and during October."
If the rise trend persisted, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments under financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the reservation is ready to inject fresh capital into the U.S. markets and to make further interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
The observations also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, such as house sales that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence was emphasized by a notice of Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in a global cost reduction to compensate for the losses of its investments in U.S. sub-prime mortgage.
Only 20 of those positions are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of the Dow Jones increased by 331 points, or 2.55%, at closure to 13,289.40, while the broad index S&P 500 increased by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased 165.5 points, or 2.7%, at the closure to 6.306.2, adding more than 39 billion GBP to the value of UK’s first order companies.
Germany’s Dax index increased 2.6%, and France’s CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Before, the reappearance of credit tension in the markets was highlighted after a strong demand in a three-month European Central Bank auction, which considered those loans to European trade banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure to the Bank of England to follow the action of the federal reserve and the ECB and inject extra funds to the London securities markets, tensioned the credit and loan rates to three months "Libor" among the British banks, meaning it the largest rise since September, of 6.59%, after a steady rise since November 12.
England trials the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England at Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is in borrowing—at least with that particular title, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the desktop of Hugh Morris, director of England, is beginning to fill with offers to become a national selector, and if not, in part, a team.
Anyone who doesn’t get the sixth place of chat will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport as well.
It is not easy to throw what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck than for capacity.
Not only in cricket choice is difficult, because judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it right for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another aspect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good degrees and who know the business well, would have been promoted to the board: there is only place for one of them.
Who should say what a good level is for a cricket player unless they give him the opportunity to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to capture the captain’s eye at the same time taking a “wicket” and a beater to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have impact as a player someday.
But capturing the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who surely plays in the first trial even if Stephen Harmison declares himself for “fit and bowls” like wind on the networks.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races for each one to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more of them.
Shah or Bopara games at Asgiriya Stadium can be just a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man’s career, or can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each trial and did it well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish at the same time who came to become an important player, and despite scoring a hundred double against Australia in Australia, it may still be underestimated.
The likelihood is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion at today’s session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah’s greatest experience about the exuberance of the young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favour of Shah is his brilliant and valuable early 88 debut test in Mumbai, 32 hundred first class opposite only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent background against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten races in his two turns in May against West Indias in the test at Lords, his house as Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next meeting, seemed to have taken from his "batting" something of stirring in Mumbai.
On the contrary, Essex’s team is happy to live in swords.
He stopped for nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summarized as when he turned his vehicle in an exhibition for England’s car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably, a shock, but the first thing he did was pull out his Vodafone (patrocinated, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate looking away, to tell him excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bofor is the best player, he is including his slippery pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, as he beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Perhaps that is the true art of the selection.
My inclination would be to give Bo for his opportunity, which doesn’t mean that Shah doesn’t excel, as tea leaves suggest, it’s him who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began to reach Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who left without cash, without visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who led them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy consisting of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad,” says Sabah al-Qubaisi, Sunni doctor.
“I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I’ve read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and which is safe now.”
"They are said that Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a momentary cessation.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite and teacher in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two sons because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want the Iraqis working in their country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him by phone to tell him that an U.S. allied force helped pull Al-Qaeda out of his bastion west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe that had been driven from their home in Sleikh north of Baghdad, for a granate attack, after urging citizens to rise against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh had begun and needed my support and that of my colleagues.”
“That’s why I’ve come back today,” said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many said they are attracted by growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops strengthen groups of "worry citizens", armed and working in cooperation with U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many claimed to have returned for the denial of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis were established in recent years.
51-year-old Salaam al-Samarrai, a father of three children, voiced the common suspicion among the exiled, that Shiite Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian quadrillas of death.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni said.
“I can’t believe in a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left it.”
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that the Sunnites have been expelled from Shiite areas and vice versa, relaxing the tension.
There is the fear that a sudden wave of refugees will cause sectarian tensions to emerge again and the struggle begins.
The little Saar, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sarges lack only one educational field.
“Yesterday I explained for fifteenth time to a non-Sarland that we are not French,” that was the ironic bike of the smallest federal state to his fifty-year-old.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a great role in the Saar education system that in a study of the Institute of German Economy (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" held the fifth place.
In this way, higher schools by tradition have good relationships with neighboring countries.
The university of Saarbrücken was merged in 1948 by the French.
Until today students can finish their college career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students coming from Saarland is higher than the average in higher schools. Many of them do not have a bacterial.
"In the Saarland, the system of vocational education is taken advantage of," says Axel Plünnecke, the educational sector expert at the Institute of German Economics (IW).
More than five young people do their bachelor’s degree at the Professional School, so it turns out that the Sarre is 7 percent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for professional-academic education is very wide.
The offering of double races, in relation to the population number, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and increasing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering decreased by a third in recent years.
That’s why the Ministry of Education of the Saarland forced higher schools to make more advertising for specialties in Engineering Sciences.
“After the first PISA study, we have made some reforms in general education schools,” said a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced comparative evidence across the country.
In order for children to begin as soon as to study the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", this has no costs. Meanwhile, this model also mimic the other federal states.
The comparison with the next studies will show whether student performance has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of students delayed in school development decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
But in general, the Saarland did not improve much as other federal states.
In Bavaria, students are able to calculate better.
The PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although they could achieve good results in this field.
Although the Sarges are not French, the language of the neighbors is a mandatory subject at the Institutes of Secondary Teaching.
Chavez changes the time.
Soon in Venezuela there will be another time frame different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez allows to modify the time in the South American country by delaying the half-hour watch.
Chavez is currently remaining a comic in Spain.
As the Official Bulletin of the Venezuelan State reported, according to the new law, the time will pass less than four hours GMT.
In this way, the South American country will have a time hub that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chavez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision saying that the United States would impose on his day the world’s obligation by changing a full hour.
Furthermore, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breakdown of relationships with his neighboring country Colombia due to the action with hostages.
The left nationalist said he would not maintain any relationships with the head of state or the Colombian government until the conservative Álvaro Uribe continued to be the president of Colombia.
“My dignity doesn’t allow me to do so,” says Chávez, who is propulsing a constitutional reform where citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
This reform could greatly expand its power in the country.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla in which it was about the release of the hostages.
Chavez said on Sunday criticizing that the decision Uribe made has offended Venezuela.
In Spain we also talk a lot about Chavez.
A new call tone causes sensation in the country: "Why don't you silence?" is the phrase that have already downloaded half a million people.
This phrase pronounced the King of Spain who felt upset by the continued interruptions by leftist populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decrease in real wage threatens Germans.
According to a forecast, a decrease in real wage this year threatens German employees despite a strong conjuncture.
Experts present a lot of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to Hans Böckler Foundation’s calculations, German employees should count in 2007 with a real wage account lower than the previous year.
“The fault of this is the weak wage evolution, the increase in value added tax and the stretch of food and energy prices,” Gustav Horn, the Institute of Macroeconomics and Economics Research, said in a statement.
New unemployment insurance loads may also correspond to employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention of reducing unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% by moving from one year to another is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the work office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and grants from the Federal State, according to the words of a politician of the German Social Democratic Party.
On Tuesday it became public that the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food and oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
By comparing prices to last year, these are increasing by 3%.
Venus: Twin brother of the Earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the planet most similar to Earth, something that has not yet been planted. The European "Venus Express" probe discovered rays in the atmosphere and beads in the poles, the same ones that appear also in winter on Earth.
For three decades, researchers have suspected that there might be rays in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus, the rays call on a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, Cris Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles tells the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous model of Urey-Miller’s life’s origin, rays caused life on Earth: storms may have caused reactions in the ocean that, on their part, have given origin to amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus it is not so: if there was someday life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution,” explains Sean Solomon of the Washington Carnegie Institute.
Today, there can be no life on Venus’ surface: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times greater than on Earth and on the surface reign temperatures of 500°C, oscillating so that temperatures can be reached under zero.
“Possibly, Venus is a ‘diabolic’ twin on Earth, but it remains a twin,” Russell said.
The main goal of the Venus Express mission is to answer the question why Venus, so similar to Earth for its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
As since the 1990s there were no special missions, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus' research.
The latest results of research that will be presented in many articles of “Nature”, according to the researchers’ opinion, underline not only Venus’ unicity in the Solar System.
“This also shows that neighboring planets have more common characteristics with the Earth than we had assumed,” the ESA reports.
Despite the already known tempest winds in the North Pole, the researchers discovered in the southern polar region also a vortex formed by clouds that rotate faster.
This phenomenon reminds the wind flows in the highland atmospheric layers of the poles, according to a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet in the Solar System has the mass almost equal to Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers is almost as large.
This planet also known as dawn star or vespertin star orbit around the Sun nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day in Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars does not resemble Earth much, scientists leave the basis that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets, water had been accumulated that on Earth was left in the oceans, but at Venus it was discovered in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, Venus forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's meat with Dalai Lama.
Federal President Koehler insists on the end of the struggle between the parties for Dalai Lama’s reception in the Federal Chancellor.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for his attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the Mitin in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany’s reputation and therefore required the great coalition to end that struggle for the receipt of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we should not present ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler told the newspaper "Handelsblatt".
At the same time, Koehler showed his understanding about the receipt of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) in September.
“Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are of absolute vitality for me,” Koehler said.
“Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance on foreign policy,” said the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach he received in carrying out a new policy with China.
“The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of a China policy.
China also knows,” Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Foreign Minister (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his disgust over the receipt of Dalai Lama and was attacked by members of the Union.
Steinmeier, among other things, criticized the Union for its unaffective policy in foreign matters.
Dalai Lama’s reception at the Federal Chancellor has caused great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relationships.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), Germany’s Minister of Finance, but also, according to informative sources of the magazine “Spiegel,” frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the Foreign Ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, Chinese Head of Government, demanded Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize this Dalai Lama reception as an error.
Affirming China’s position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians to receive the Tibetan religious leader in its official position.
Dalai Lama’s actions and words showed that it is attempting to split Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now also includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that disturbances such as those happening in France will occur.
Battles with police in the streets, shots, car burning: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that disturbances will happen as was the case with France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not move to the streets.
Barricades were made, the vandals fired with guns to the police: after serious riots played by young people in France, the Federal Minister for Interior Affairs Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
“We have to look at our country’s social problems not to take the form of violent.”
"We have to take that seriously," he said in the newspaper "Neue Presse", published in Hannover.
Not all young people develop in the constant change of social reality.
The Federal State, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
From the Integration Summit to the Islam Conference: all of this is already giving its first fruit.
It’s still early to secure the end of the alarm.
At the same time, Schaeuble indicated that German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as it happens in France.
The young people played serious riots on the streets with police north of Paris last nights.
In Tolouse, cars and public buildings were also burned.
Kenan Kolat, President of the Turkish Community in Germany, demanded greater efforts from the Federal Government to integrate.
Kolat, in view of the disturbances in France, warns of an imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, the actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 is above the average.
More jobs of vocational training must be taken care of.
Kolat emphasizes: “We have to give young people a perspective.”
The president of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", greater than the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, “But despite all, we have to be careful.”
It is necessary to give young people the opportunity to get a job or vocational training faster.
Meanwhile the night in the Paris suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police participated in the action, a helicopter with lights flew over the territory.
Responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as waste and burned cars.
Since the day before, a team of nearly 1,000 police officers is taking care of security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, Minister of Interior Affairs, announced that police will take rigorous action until it is necessary.
On Monday night to Tuesday, around 80 police officers were wounded by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The disturbances continued the following night in Tolouse.
The trouble began by a road accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecutor, the death of young people was not the cause of the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The performance very far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, demonstrates that the coalition as to content reached its last point and that nothing else should be expected from it.
Which country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate, indifferent and uncontained action in the overall debate of the Lower Chamber, one must say: she does not live in the country that should be governed by her.
As for the reproach that was made for repeatedly being dedicated to actions in foreign policy, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous sentence.
He said that it would be a provincial mode and thus showed that he did not want to understand what it interests critics.
In the Lower Chamber, it was clearly stated to everyone that this reproach was appropriate.
It could not be felt a minimum interest, nor any kind of feeling for the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented itself in this way: a very high policy that flees into foreign policy and remains there without achieving anything specifically.
One example: the prevention of climate change: it was greatly praised itself for the decisions made in Heiligendamm, but it doesn’t say anything about how these targets should be achieved here in climate issues.
Overall, this way of praising himself - for two years the Chief of the Christian Democratic Union Party has not been able to allow himself so modestly.
It is committed to expressions in order to reach an impulse to people.
And thus it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves the problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke the inner problems are appearances of little value.
Does the poverty of children and concerns for workers with low wages?
The only thing you devote is to talk about this subject using subordinate prayers.
It’s impressive how many times you mistake talking when it comes to the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good phrase.
It begins to stumble "as if it had been in an unknown territory," when it was more concrete information.
The section of attacks.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, made a confrontation in a warm debate on YouTube’s Republican presidential pre-candidates and now they must fear only one foreign candidate.
The tensions between candidates have been noticed from the beginning.
Mitt Romney accused his opponent Rudy Giuliani that he would have turned New York into "a shelter site for illegal immigrants."
Giuliani responded to the former governor of Massachusetts saying he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attacks: as the Republican group so far does not have a clear favorite, the eight presidential pre-candidates take advantage of the debate at CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
Small 30-second videos, shot by internet users that were sent to Youtube, also have a lot of content.
"With this mode of isolation we let Hitler get to power," John McCain reproached his adversary Ron Paul, the only in the meeting that insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives many criticisms from the Vietnamese war veterans when he refuses to recognize as torture the "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation, by letting a person drowning simulate his death.
Public reactions in the hall in St. Petersburg, Florida show that while the most important topics of the campaign are others, not just war in Iraq or torture debates.
The public always applauded very strongly when they praised conservative values and denied the rise of taxes.
So you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
“At that time I mistaken,” explains Romney computed and ask for forgiveness to the people and the television audience for being abortion advocate in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, didn’t know what to say when asked him what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf rules without uniform.
One day after his resignation as army chief, Pakistan’s president turned to swear as president.
Thus the eight years of military government in Pakistan ended.
On Thursday, President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf, took an oath for a second five-year term.
Pakistan’s television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the nation’s well-being.
On Wednesday he transferred his army chief mandate to his confident Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially by the US.
Eight years after he was made with power with an embedded military coup, the former general rules the state as a civilian chief for the first time.
With his resignation to the position of chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the west.
The other requirement is the end of the state of exception, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state prosecutor-general, after Musharraf's oath will soon cancel the state of exception and fulfil the second condition of the west.
Since the state of exception was proclaimed in the Supreme Court there were many supporters of Musharraf. Last week the country's Supreme Court rejected all the remedies before the controversial new elections of the head of the government on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Wathyristan region, five soldiers were killed and four were wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded in one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock return.
The most famous German band of the 1970s follows its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a reestreno, a copy of "Live 1974" was made which was written in the best era of the band.
Already at that time they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three men to an official meal caused the feeling.
Each of them has before them their box, their wires, and above all their buttons.
In the middle is sitting Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and dressed in a white shirt.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
To the right, looking at the audience, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes with their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
It seems that this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock’s passionates was the fact that the Harmonia band would make music again.
What must be rebelled here is the following: questions have accurately shown that the band’s name rebuckled in people’s minds, but it wasn’t so special thing that after 32 years the audience missed her so much.
But why can’t Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because the misunderstanding Krautrock has always been more valued in England and the United States than in their own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a music award "Echo" to members of the Cologne band Can 2003 for their lifework, in the room they could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouth with amazement.
Later Michael Rother spent time on stage during Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are just one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio existed only two years and at that time it did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it was subsequently obtained thanks to the others.
Moebius and Roedelius had made music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the Berliner Schaubuehne basement.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronated by a church.
For a while, Rother had a worker at Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist in the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at the time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed Cluster musicians in the exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could be complained of his position.
That was rather a life of artist full of surprises.
As they say, one day an Ottenstein’s Harmony song association banderin appeared in the garbage, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn’t just to know himself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that, in this recording, nearly 50 people participated.
Then Rother expressed his desire to drive Harmony and do trials from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this demand is against customs.
In 1975, the band announced its separation.
Rother ended up taking into esoterism topics and assured his existence with albums like "Flamende Herz".
Cluster revived the eighty years and since that time has been more successful than Harmonia had.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that should be thanked to Groenemeyer.
His Grienland music company was going to cultivate this own German contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like Roedelius’s work, the band Neu! was again discovered.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was granted with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the English, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all Krautrock's influences to the next pop song are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a position that was empty.
Brian Eno’s phrase accompanied by special music fill the room: “This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future.”
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers in a farm.
The history of the legend’s development is shown in black and white photo projections, where instruments with cables are seen.
In the bottom there are three veterans who began improvising again.
They do nothing but attach the microphones to the organ and battery so they can produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effect apparatus they had built with their own hands.
Electronic music is just as it had to be.
Three people deep into the art.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere it toasts, sucks, and at a good time of emphasis it sings "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!".
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing the artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here screamed "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia keeps calm.
In the scenario, you think very well about what is already obvious.
Where does the music start and where does the music end?
That can break the nerves to one or give a few quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynism.
The two movies "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again dedicated to the war in the Balkans.
But both didn’t have much conviction.
Or the concepts are much fixed on actions and shootings or the two movies are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" cannot help in this case either.
At the beginning there was a good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the mountains of the Balkans, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnia War, was again discovered actor Richard Gere.
We finally lost sight of the most nice man of the 1980s, because no one wanted to watch after his pleasant and little-important roles in women’s movies and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to watch perhaps the movie "The Hunting Party - when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why today the movies titles have to be so long and foolish?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the sight: in the background, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the fate and the film industry would not have been so merciful to him. He was a man whose better times of life have already passed, that as a monument of the ruin of his decay until now preserved most of his enchant.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, it turns out to be only a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated in short words: it's two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbian from Kosovo's snipers, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The sense of the film is lost by actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented once again as the only guilty.
The film is like the German series "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because there was never a good movie about the war in the Balkans.
Another time, with another director and another scriptwriter (Richard Shepard in two charges), the story about American reporters in the war going to detect a war criminal Serb called "zoro", probably could be a new "Apocalypse Now".
So the stories are surprisingly similar: small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army cannot do and each time is a crazy journey.
One reason for The Hunting Party’s failure is when at first they introduce us to Simon Hunt, whom they don’t let him be simply a cynical with heart.
No, the script also predicts a loving adventure with a Muslim Bosnia who will be killing later.
Then "The Hunting Party" is far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters quickly achieved what NATO, the CIA and all the world’s head hunters failed to achieve for five years, which was captured by the war criminal and left Muslim Bosnians to get themselves revenge in a fair way.
It’s so bad that they will appeal to the international court in Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is actually a deeply human.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and stresses that Americans and the French are not really concerned about pursuing them because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to the head a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "I see in the great wrinkles on his forehead, sharing the feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show that it is hard to be good.
The problem is not just the genre of war movies in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiasco.
It can also be added that there has never been a good movie about South Africa.
Almost always worth one rule: when a star goes through a crisis region or through the mine fields, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "Overside of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blooding Diamants" with Leonardo DiCaprio appears.
Perhaps all these conflicts occurred within a short time.
They have to spend at least decades until Hollywood rolls a good movie about the Holocaust, taking as an example the movie "The Schindler List."
Some movies already need more time. Classics like the works on the war in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their times were not celebrated unanimously as the masterpieces.
Nowadays we may know too much about world conflicts, and this is why every killing (Massenmord) is presented directly on two home TVs.
And that's because scriptwriters don't have the smallest repair (which is necessary to be able) to tell good stories.
"Be or not being" or "The Great Dictator" were so good at the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know that the Nazi regime was actually so bad.
Perhaps you shouldn’t be a good person to shoot a movie.
Perhaps you have to be like novel writer Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look from an artist.
When asked him about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That's only because some things never change."
Great cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly killed, and in Yugoslavia war will always rule.
Von Beust receives as an answer the negative criticism of the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms of politics and economy for not applying for the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that you have to be realistic by estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, Director-General of the Hamburg Chamber of Trade, said Wednesday this resignation as “not good for the economic location.”
In the last time, no other project in the big city encouraged as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
"Without this goal, political, sporting impulse could not be kept at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
On Wednesday Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that Hamburg’s ambitions in the organisation of the Summer Olympics will not be held until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports decides it," says von Beust at the World Online.
He referred to the Sports Federation’s decision to be expected early in December on Munich’s application for the Winter Olympics of 2028.
“This preference means for us that in this period of time, which we so far thought to have until 2028, from realistic point of view, we will have no chance.”
Despite all, this dream didn’t end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets the statements of von Beut.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympics.
"It's too soon to let the opportunity be removed, if the plans are now ruined," HSB director Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A resignation of the request is contradictory to the statement of the head of the Senate made at a reception at the General Meeting of the German Public Sport Federation of Higher Schools (ADH).
There von Beust designated the 2015 Hamburg application for universities not as a "replacement" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Higher School Sports Federation appointed Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The Fraction of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) reproached the senate that it did not take advantage of the valuable time for building houses in Hamburg.
“For many years the Senate was delayed with the development of the small neighborhood of Grasbrook, because it was on plans for the Olympic Games or building houses,” said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, German Social Democratic Party (SPD) members.
While the SPD always required integrated Olympia planning for the small Grasbrook and then the use of the houses built, the CDU emphasized the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg’s application for the 2012 Summer Olympics caused great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Who relates the terms Sweden and wood box, thinks of Ikea, but doesn’t think of Andy Warhol.
Or yes?
Currently wood boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow weighing over Warhol’s list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "type" box on this list are false.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" posed doubt about the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of 1968 by Andy Warhol, the Modern Museum of Stockholm conducted internal investigations and reached disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Museum of Hultén and the others are almost.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brill-Boxes" in New York, painted the wooden boxes of red, blue and white, with the same sample that they had "Brill" soap dust cartons.
According to Warhol, at the 1968 exhibition of his works at the Modern Museet Museum, hundreds of cardboard brilliance-boxes were exposed. These did not make them Warhol (because of expenses), but were brought directly from the "Brill" cardboard factory.
It was not works of art, but exemplaries (which were only a few objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed Sweden to produce wood boxes, but were not exposed to the Modern Museet Museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak that almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auction as originals of the "Stockholm-type" boxes authorized by Andy Warhol.
In auctions, some of them were bought for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed nearly one hundred of the wooden boxes Warhol left them to him.
But actually, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At this time, Warhol had already died for three years.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives of the Modern Museet Museum, investigated six Brilliance-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of 1990 shows that the painting was applied with a roller without directly printing the tight silver. In addition, it is not about oil painting, but acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from the official list of Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol," says Lars Nittve, director of the Modern Museet Museum, and added that if the Authentication Commission "Andy Warhol Art" in New York does not come to any conclusion, the Modern Museet Museum will classify these six boxes as copies.
Already in July, the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "grave accusations" that it comes to soap dust boxes.
But from that moment there everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrendered in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had trinched in a hotel in Manila have been given over and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blames the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter she could not respond for shedding blood.
The government-faithful soldiers had assaulted the hotel using tear gas.
Almost two hundred soldiers were drowned in the building for a few hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had Thursday trial for attempting a coup in 2003 that ended in a failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, to suddenly be able to deposit with about 30 sympathizers.
Obviously the military police who had to watch him had gone into their rows and followed his motion.
They entered the Peninsula hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around Hotel Noble.
The president called on an urgent meeting of the Security Office.
Norberto Gonzales, national security counselor, condemned the behavior of soldiers.
“People are tired,” Trillanes said.
"We call people to pass into our rows."
General Danilo Lim, who previously led the Scout Reangers elite troop, said that soon the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
The major government critics called on Thursday for a major demonstration against the president.
For months his government has been accused of corruption.
In 2003, the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention by the dispute that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 in the Philippines, there have been at least seven attempts of coups against the government elected democratically.
United Internet will be Versatel’s largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of telecommunications company Versatel’s shares.
On Wednesday, the company reported that the average price for an equity is 14.46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the capital.
There were many speculation about the company’s absorption.
There are also options to increase the financial share in Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German market of DSL (Digital Subscriber Line).
On Wednesday, the Bank of Brendenberg increased its share of the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market that means that the financial institution maintains shareholders for a third party partner.
United Internet already on the day before made nearly 10 percent of the telecommunication company Drillisch participate.
Drillisch in the extent of capital enlargement placed 17.4 million of the new shares that have a value of 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.

"We strengthen our collaboration," United Internet spokesman explained.
The two companies founded a joint MSP company, to acquire the Freenet competitor.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that at the beginning, the two companies want to be happy with the share of ten percent on Freenet and do not make use of their right, i.e., they make 18.49 percent on Freenet.
That meant that both companies kept all the options, especially participation in Freenet’s anonymous society.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German market of Telecom.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
Until now, the holding of United Internet and Drillisch had directly 6.01 percent of Freenet stake.
Then they had agreed that Drilllich is going to achieve the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company was already agreed in August.
