DFB chief Grindel does not see a foundation for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return from Mesut Özil to the national team.
“This is, of course, a question that depends on one conversation once, one talking to him as well about why he has apparently felt one or another as described in his statement,” Grindel said in the football podcast “Phrase Cutters” of the Bild-News.
Despite the monthly debate on the photographs of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-fold national player Özil.
“I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I’ve also at some point assumed that it would be like that,” said Grindel.
De 29-year-old explained his resignation from the DFB team in July and founded that Grindel did not defend him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism of Özil that Özil was not ready for a conversation with federal coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn’t want to build a pressure, but he knows it from football so that “if you leave a team or switch a club, you talk about it with your coach and I feel it’s a shame that this conversation has not yet come to accomplish.”
Linz: garden cottage in Schreberggartenhaus
At 14.13 a.m. the professional fire defense Linz was alarmed into a fire in the Angerhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line directly leads over the screwing-style settlement, danger was in delay.
The professional fire defense went out and came in full fire when the cottage arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically to the dance and fireshed to the extent necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had infected a battery for the store at lunch.
This may be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to firefighters, the charger was located in the area of the largest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire must still be determined - as is the cause of the fire.
He might, however, be considerable, because the owner had many pieces of collectors in his garden hut.
Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open roads
What did Lindsay Lohan drive to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to remove the children from a supposed refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") streamed himself live, as she apparently wants to remove the children from a family in Moscow.
This reports the U.S. portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial medium of the stream.
Here you can see "Kiss for Luck" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip, Lohan is going out of a car and going to a perhaps homeless family that she wants to be a refugee family from Syria.
When the family fled just before the actress, Lohan pursued parents and their children.
It accuses adult child trafficking.
For all this, she doesn’t provide any evidence in the clip.
“The whole world sees that right,” Lohan is hearing in the video as she continues to pursue the family along the street.
Apparently, she tries to separate her children from her parents.
Sometime, however, the obviously angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan missed a header.
Under tears, the actress declares how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What Lohan has focused on this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is intended to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can suck material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign tickets: Number of dead in Sulawesi rises to more than 400
Following the severe earthquake of strength 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 deaths are reported.
The number of victims can rise further.
The rescue teams have not yet gone into the devastated and cut-off areas of the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Chief Executive Board
At the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla’s chief Elon Musk caused trouble in the stock markets in early August when he announced a retreat from the electrocar manufacturer.
The U.S. exchange surveillance accused him of fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and Tesla’s chief retreats from the Supervisory Board, but Chairman of the Board may remain.

Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("This is not") is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in Brazil is divided.
Thousands went to the streets in several cities to protest the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate and thus stands forward in the surveys.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad from the Left Worker Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
“The diesel task force still exists,” said CEO Peter Mertens to the Automotive Week industry.
Audi’s detainee and lawyer chief Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the taskforce will soon be dissolved.
“In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gearbox combinations are expected to be tested,” he said at the time.
Mertens said, “In early July, we have reached an important stage target in the processing of diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car constructor made "graving organizational changes" so that such a scandal never occurs again.
The VW Supervisory Board had delayed a decision on Stadler’s future on Friday and wanted to further discuss this Tuesday.
The investigative authorities claim the Audi chief to have authorised the sale of dieselautos with false exhaust values after the exhaust frauds becomes known.
He knew of the manipulations or ignored them consciously.
Bram Schot currently leads the company as a CEO of the Commissioner.
Due to the move to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, Schot said the Heilbronner Voice.
Basically, he sees a decreasing demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
“The segment in itself is difficult,” he said.
Scotland relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electrocar, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel seeks to re-selection - Lahm to DFB presidency
Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and Özil affair, Reinhard Grindel wants to recandicate for the office as DFB President next year.
“I’m doing my job and trying to do it as well as it’s going,” Grindel said as a guest early Sunday morning at the ZDF’s Current Sports Studio.
You have to try to re-election again and again, I'm going to do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the union leader would find it "bizarre" if after the addition for the 2024 EM, he wouldn't have to "will work on the future project."
Since April 2016, Grindel has been the leader of the association as the successor of the Wolfgang Niersbach collapsed over the summermarchen affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first complete three-year term.
The next vote will be held at the DFB Bundestag on September 27, 2019.
Future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm is expected to work in the DFB presidency, according to Grindel.
"I would be happy if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that he will also be advised in this role in the Bureau in the future and then, of course, be warmly invited to provide his experience in sports issues," Grindel said.
In speculation whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair about the photographs of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the desire for the future to become a national player without a migration background integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office of the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
“If someone with no migrant background clearly engages in society and football and says, ‘the issue is important, we have to take care of it’, that would also be an initiative to ensure a better foundation for our local associations where integration must work,” Grindel said.
Low weight with semi-clear scale
I have a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat amount.
Muscle and bone mass can also show it.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it is rather for the spice.

Basketball Bundesliga: Clear uptake for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin is launched with a clear victory in the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-master won easily with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing match over 40 minutes.
Rokas Giedratis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliner with 20 points.
Ludwigsburg-committed national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) also showed an attractive performance before 9113 spectators at his mandatory game debut.
Ex-meister Brose Bamberg won at the mandatory game debut by Trainer Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best player with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came to 14 counters.
Last year’s playoff-halbfinalist MHP Giant Ludwigsburg conquered the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New-national player Karim Jallow was with 24 points the most secure shooter at the team of trainer John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new game time with a clear success.
There was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings was overwhelming with the Oldenburgers with 25 counters.
The Braunschweiger, whom NBA star Dennis Schröder has been a majority-owner since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day visit.
Critics to Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan urged the German government to deliver followers of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
“We will not allow sympathisants of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship,” he said.
For the opening of the Ditib mosque, the Cologne city center was partially blocked.
Several thousand police officers were in use - among them also snipers.
The Islam Association Ditib is in criticism because it is considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, Buhruges and Horror
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have announced a joint concert at New York Central Park for more commitment to fighting poverty and disease.
"Engage yourself wherever you can," Mendes told about 60,000 spectators at the festival Sunday night.
Thank you for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with franses and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I sweat, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organisations showed themselves at the multi-hour spectacle on the stage.
In the meantime, however, there was a fearful second when many spectators considered the noise of an encircling metal shutdown for shots, feared and tried to escape.
Shortly, panic came out, people ran confused.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, organizer Hugh Evans said.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin then soothed the people from the stage.
“No one is trying to hurt anyone,” Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were free on the Internet, like every year.
Those who wanted to earn one had to read and disseminate on the Internet texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors, the audience joys and applauses – but for the Republican senator Jeff Flake.
Although he spoke together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke in the U.S. Senate Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, thus hitting many women in front of his head.
At least three women have accused of abuse until attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he denies.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the allegations after two women who, according to their own information, have experienced sexual assaults, faced him on the way to a committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also come together in an elevator at any time," Flake said at the concert in New York.
Freedom of Press: Federal Government Defends Journalist's Draft
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the draft of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
At the Chancellor’s office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had transferred a T-shirt with the Turkish and German entitlement “Freedom for Journalists” and went to the first row.
The T-shirt wasn’t the problem, Seibert said on Sunday.
It was a disruption of the workout of the press conference.
The journalist’s action caused a strong trouble, which was not acceptable.
That's why he caused person protectors to bring the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellor.
This applies entirely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged spying activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Gulen movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threaten decades of detention.
Even foreign journalists are not sure before Turkish authorities: until early September, Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
The cases of detained journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had taken care of an assault.
Although they were free and could return to Germany, they were still proceeding against the two in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz fully drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so freshly and beautifully: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: yes, that’s really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for moisturizing conversations at the theke of the Hamburg Hafenkneipe "Schelfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller, with her guests, puts on some beer, some wine or even higher percentage drinks to appeal to mood and tongues.
Not a few promises also drink courage for the mandatory singing deposits.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time, the actor Florian David Fitz known from films such as "Man Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Best Day".
The Munich trip to the high north didn’t get well.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie – his face is completely cracked at it, his eyes are only two small slots.
The bed selfie shows a completely lazy Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he has only a powerful cat.
He posted to his fans some - probably not very seriously - findings he has now won: "Regularly one: NEVER goes to Inas night.
Rule Two: Never drink the black sauce.
And Spritz.
And the round egg liquor, which sparks Ina around half three, also leave away.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips about fighting the suicide.
They extended from instant brush, fish browns or - probably most targeting - headache tablets.
Others just had fun about the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
How Ina Müller has survived the nightlife is not known yet.
Because it has moderated the TV fun at the Theke since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be significantly tested.
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and unrate
The entry into the 36 kilometres long railway in the Red Kappland in Treysa shows itself difficult to find and bleach.
Recipes against grasping vandalism are searched, but solutions are hardly distinguished.
Scherben, cigarette kips, garbage and unrat, demolished garbage trays and now demolished signals - thus, since long time the entry with a seating group to the cycling path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented.
For the display object railway path in the Red Käppchenland, a more than incredible view.
The topic is employed by members of the ADFC Local Group Schwalmstadt but also by others for a long time, according to the Cycling Representative of the city of Ulrich Wüstennhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the bike traffic council.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the laying of the seat group to regular waste tanks and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think this latter would be the hour commandment - regardless of possible further activities," Desertnhagen said.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he also brought the topic to the local council.
Not only does the garbage drive cyclists and residents around - the seat group is on weekends for regular meeting.
Not only is it often going to be loud, the gears are also destroyed: posts ripped out of the earth, waste bar demolished, signs turned over, seat furniture oil.
Volunteers have been cleaning more often, ADFC member Susanne Klippert says.
But the actions are only the proverblic drops on the hot stone.
You're annoyed that the rastplatz on the bike path is in Treysa meeting place for drinking.
“Throughout the entire cycling path, the focus is clearly here on the Haaße-Hügel,” confirms the Cycling Representative, who now also takes care of the new cycling site in goathain, which is opened today.
"If they suffer the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: “Possibly, this sets the threshold significantly higher to grasp the gemeinde.
However, this would require a police strip to pass soon.
In principle, deserthagen wishes to develop the Haasse hill.
It must be made more attractive.
To date, you can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycling path.
Tourist marketing is still expanding.
Our cycling path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany,” the ADFC members said.
As an extremely critical danger point, ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in the Ascheröder street in Treysa.
There is no bending track on the Haasse hill.
In rainy traffic it may happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of traffic flow," she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but probably for older people and especially for children.
Music Contest at the Cultural Railway Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the Lake
The first call to the musical contest was a success, creative and in common.
"To demonstrate a song for Hiltrup," the call of the Hiltrup district offensive, in the "Music Contest for Big and Small, Young and Experienced Musicians".
A contest "with eyewinds in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family member of coffee and cakes from the volunteers of the cultural railway station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Heilig, a long-living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper star colors", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Wemblen,
This contest, Mayor Joachim Schmidt said, is a newness.
We haven’t seen this in other districts yet.
What were the texts connected to?
In the places, the Hiltruper Lake and the Market Allée were particularly often mentioned.
Rolf Hilig made the alley to the "Kö von Hiltrup" in his bearing-like song.
The cultural railway station was also awarded.
It was always about the experience of each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke lived the short pauses with short interviews with the interpreters or indications about their creation.
So we learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now also teached guitar.
Sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann knew Franke to report that the recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
Meanwhile, Alvin Jasic has all placed on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltrup gastronomy.
There was still something special for the jury’s favorites - so that others can hear their songs too.
A whole CD can play Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Onymous with his hiltrup ball, which impressed Franke especially with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful appearance" with ten children and two teachers on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all the kids went to the final again - and even without electronic support sounded "really good," Franke said.
The jury was led by the aspects of originality, reference to hiltrup, melody's incompatibility and recognition value.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the Westphalische School of Music, Andreas Klomplätze from the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Association, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event due to its ten-year-old existence.
She appreciated the event as a full success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" soon in the very full cultural railway station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams sitting opposite each other.
For each side there is a viewscreen, in which four cards with keywords can be deciphered - the old trick with the red film - until you put them in.
Thus, it is guaranteed that the opposite side cannot read anything in accident.
On the maps, for example, reading from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2nd window.
3. cubes.
4th Fest."
These are the terms that are now to be encrypted.
It is not about the terms, but about codes.
Alternatively, one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card on which may be "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" it is intended to be argued not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "cube", "fest" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opponent's team doesn't as possible; because this wins the match if he manages twice to crack the code.
The encryptor therefore notes and reads loudly: “Publish” for the cubes, “Lose” as opposed to the festival; of course, there would be something like “Party” and “Prag” as he watched at school and knows the window crash there.
This is how round for round, team for team goes on.
Although you don’t know the terms of the opposite side, it can be better gathered with any note that the encryptor gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too turned, the conversions should be, so otherwise you make it unnecessary to your team.
The most cryptic on "Decrypto" is, unfortunately, the rule.
The players probably need to study it quite long and thoroughly until they can finally play.
The explanation video on decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
But whoever first started will be fascinated about how much feeling is in this unlikely game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not as clear as predecessors and genre-primus "Codenames", which also runs an agent theme on a game fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And whoever it's just about rates and not about victory points, it can also easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greetings and harass guests at the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach in the night of Saturday to Sunday.
Only he showed Hitler's greeting in the Upper City of a Passing Police Strip, and later he also fell in a pub in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After he didn’t get a significantly alcoholized reference from the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the detention cell.
In sober condition, he must also be criminally responsible for the use of marks of constitutional illegal organisations.
Pressig was home to the shoblocks.
The railway operation plant in Pressig was the rotary disk in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
“When buffers cracked on buffers, they heard it in all pressing,” recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the railway station.
That didn't excite anyone.
There also the brakes quietly cracked and the wagons cracked.
That was just a pure railway.
Statements that are symbolic for Dinkel's home pressing.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so characterized by the railroad.
Here was the starting point of the steilramp mountain track to the north, which after an increase of about 220 meters of heights has its shell point in Steinbach am forest.
In order to deal with this, earlier train and shot blocks were needed that had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway operating facility with 21 locchuppes, learning facility, guidance and railway mastery.
“Heartpiece was the rotary disk that had a diameter of 18 meters after a reconstruction in 1899,” says Norbert Heidrich from Hirshaid, railway historian and 47 years of professional railway.
The railway operating plant (BW) Pressig, which was undertaken in 1968 to Bamberg, also operated locks for the sidelines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff stock of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed at the time in Pressig.
The electrification of the track in 1939 has already minimized the need for train and drain blocks.
Since 1977, they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 weights were ranked in the month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were disrupted, and the rest was disrupted in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is unfortunate that you have not taken a better use of the site, even in freight traffic."
Even on Pentecost in 1989, the railway office of Nuremberg to the anniversary of "50 years of electricification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig.
“There were 10,000 enthusiastic viewers here,” recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Ranger Station Pressig was history.
“The rangers and inhibitor shoes have done the most difficult work in train traffic,” says Dinkel.
Each mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures are available here in the under-Plus article.
Kerber with success in China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as previously Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against French Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the World Rank-Third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Victory led 6:3, 4:2 against Darjah Kassatkina when the Russian set at number 13 abandoned.
The daughter is now getting to do with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition in Mittelehrenbach was opened on the weekend as part of the series "Kunst und Genuss".
With great ease, registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when in the free area of the property Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach, the Special Vernissage "Windspiel Performance" was opened.
It takes place under the roof of the Tourism Association "Round around Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Enjoy".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A great visitor admission showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now to be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Houselor Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made himself a name as the main organizer and artist equally.
Something surprisingly, but Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he put his task in proven, young hands with a good perspective of the future.
Both have already actively participated in the selection of artists in the past and designed flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of Art & Enjoy, there is a 70-cent special letter brand designed once again, available at any art station.
This year’s poster “Betzn” designed by Volker Hahn can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn rejoiced the high advocacy of the special exhibition.
For the musical framework, Max Marcus Stadler was won from Nuremberg.
When walking through the generous garden, the visitor quickly becomes clear that the title "Windplay Performance" formally challenges artistic imagination and ultimately expresses playfully.
It is artworks made of metal or ceramic, often provided with colorful accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor is waiting on the right side of the "Glückbaum" by the artist Werner Bauer, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, colorfully lightened, playfully furnished with 20 wind turbines, 24 hufes and 24 aluminum tubes as a piece of sound.
With the sun shining through the bush plant in the background, the object looks soundful and invites it to stay.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental, which is preferred in three-dimensional letters dedicated to the event 15 years of K&G.
There are many parts, in the wind moving.
A half-track, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colorful imagination of sound, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Wind Game Performance" to the Sliding through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 Years MGV 68 Watches: Singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And also the watchers made their disgust air at the time.
At least five of them.
They didn’t want to find themselves everywhere with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir “Cecilia” there should be no longer blood life in the district.
In the meantime, it has become a legend: at a bank in the Tinnenbush, they raised the MGV 68 watches from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated largely in the House of Meeting.
“It’s going to be full today,” said President Jürgen Holstiges, and he should retain right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the singers.
In particular, for the anniversary, they had resurvived the Foundation Festival.
It was tradition for years, then there was a break.
At the time of the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball was it to have been asked for festive clothes before.
The guests did not sit in the "house of meeting" in seating rows, but cozy at tables.
In the meantime, movement was announced: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln took the controllers and asked for the dance surface.
The singers of the MGV 68 watched the voice themselves.
Suitable for the occasion, happy songs were announced.
Almost already stated: "A day like that, as beautiful as today."
Suitable to the exquisite grape juice that many had before themselves, there was the "Rüdesheimer wine".
In connection with another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus", which is the Latin name for "hop".

The women's choir "Hohes C" was also guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The Ascender is marching.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of USC Münster under the screen of Axel Büring finds itself really well in Liga Three.
No trace of shame or fracking, the independents do their thing.
And this at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitors BW Aasee really good.
"That wasn't clear, but we've already left impression," says the somewhat satisfied coach.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed to him: “This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
At the evening at a later birthday celebration of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was disturbed.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third sentence, the guests had a setball.
“If you’re going to get the goal, such a game can ever go,” Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routine forces and brought the full output to the target.
“We all know who stands in such a derby on the other side.
This doesn't break our neck.
I saw a very good volleyball in a phase,” Annacker didn’t argue with 0:3 – and went to the agenda immediately.
Where the trip for the independents goes, it seems not expected after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The third league has an incredibly good level.
This is not almost comparable to regional liga volleyball." In the fourth league, they no longer want to look down.
If the vests are not polluted in the next few weeks, they have to look up.
A first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday, we’re going to Emlichheim.
Aasee will arrive in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship" Heide Keller became the star.
Now she openly speaks that the series might have had a co-responsibility to her marriage with Hans von Borsody.
Her role of chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dreamship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left forever from board.
The series that made her become a star could be responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013) with which she was married for ten years.
“That might have been a reason too.
Because I grew up with this work, I traveled alone around the world with a suitcase and many of my admired colleagues saw me at the height of my eyes,” Keller says in a conversation with the Picture am Sonntag.
First of all, she was only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
Now the journalists only called to Heide Keller.
"Whether he liked it so well, I don't know."
She thinks it is possible that her man could have been quite jealous, but “as many men feared Hans talks about problems and feelings.”
Keller has always tried to be the only right one for Hans von Borsody and he did not want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I’ve got myself default,” she continues to explain.
She always felt that she wasn’t good enough for him.
He saw an emancipated woman in me whom I was never really, even though I sometimes appeared crazy and brave on the stage.
I wanted our love to be forever.”
After a marriage with Thomas Härtner failed before, Keller said Yes again, "although I was afraid that it might go wrong for a second time."
On the day before the statutory trust, I sat crying in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
Borsody’s marriage also failed.
Why did it never work with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller's love was then "like in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I’ve got too naive to love.”
The Night Falter, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city at the NZZ resort of Zurich, has dared to the ZFF opening party this time.
Our fold is not a moth, but a little light dislike.
And the bright shine, in which a green carpet is dipped on the six-secured square, blends it over charge.
But it’s a film festival, where more or less famous people want to sunshine in the lightlight.
This Thursday night he turns over the square to briefly easier in the Aquaclean WC oase.
Thus, the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival, is called the public toilet facility: the necessity facility in the parterre of a new pavilion is making a lot of efforts to stream a luxurious atmosphere.
This evening, however, it's stunning to heaven in the Lord's Oase for any reason.
So out here, to the other street side: invited guests who have entertained in the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book" just at the best level, celebrate the festival beginning with a party in the three floors storehouse, like every year.
His name fits perfectly with this film festival: From the whole Earthball comes knownly the works shown.
What doesn’t have to do with an article about this festival in order not to fall into advertising for its 190 partner companies?
The fold bonds a band around the feelers, which has attached a good fearing to him, and two busty doorsteers actually wink him in generously.
Inside, the invited are pressing themselves, dancing far after midnight to live music or pretending themselves by DJ rhythms to which they scream, and rinsing with cupli exquisite pets down.
In the delicate shop in the underground, osterns wait for sweeping munders, next to it, the unparalleled raw chinese Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate sprinkle.
And the hammer is: all the sales shelves of fully exclusive products have not been cleaned for the occasion.
This has been so for years, so it seems to work without great losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The fold study the shield at the roll staircase: "Bring a long dress, please be careful on the roll staircase."
If the two instructions are separate, he has gone into the dress code.
But it's rather a conditional construction, and it's certainly saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the poultry kips a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the festival award.
The price for the best drink is not mandatory for this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents himself.
And George Clooney, who has been advocating for that brand for years, is not here on the evening either.
But as, between local celebrity, cassential and kitchen articles, passes a face that is known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main actor might not be far.
And really: Just like Viggo Mortensen, with soon almost sixty acting like a choir, walks through the crowd.
He's not fitted, he's not fitted, he's not fitted, he's not fitted.
Especially for this restraint, misunderstood as a cleverness, international stars love this movie festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances

Argentine’s football legend Diego Maradona appears to have been good in his new homeland Mexico.
After a 2:0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old trainer danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia rhythms, as can be seen in a video already published on Saturday.

Handball: Associations League 1: ASV Send after last-minute plug "destroyed in the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the Handball League ASV Send, could hardly capture it: "Such a bitter defeat". His protectors were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They didn’t play badly — as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst — over vast phases, the transmitters.
Only the beginning phase “we have totally slept,” the ASV trainer was angry.
The householders quickly led 8:1, even the early break that Bieletzki had taken, did not initially fruit.
“But then suddenly a ruck went through the team,” Bieletzki summarized the second quarter hour.
For the break, the residue was only more than two goals.
Especially sending the best, Marius Hintze, met in the phase once again.
After the change, it became even better from the view of visitors.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst appeared at 15:15, then the season changer led almost continuously.
Four minutes before the sirene, the forefront was still seem to be calming three hits (29:26).
What then?
Take the unpartisans into what happens.
Bieletzki usually takes care of looking for the guilty of others.
But: The 120-second time punishment that Steffen Mühlhoff casted "was a joke."
LIT had laughed well and met four times until the end - while the decimated ASV failed in the last attack.
The boys have fought great, standing well against seven men behind, and repeatedly thrown to the empty gate.
Only you can buy little for the compliments.
“Now a damn victory has to be done,” said Bieletzki.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hugging (1).

Elon Musk, the founder of electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatening resignation as head of the billion-heavy company.
He and the US exchange supervisory SEC made a dispute on misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to conduct exchange-noted companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million per dollar, and Musk gives the office of Chairman for three years, a position comparable to the German Chief Supervisory Board.
He may remain Head of Executive Board.
In the comparison, which needs to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had accused the world-famous manager before the United States Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, also leading the SpaceX space company, is the public face of electric car pioneers writing losses, which is now rated on the stock exchange with more than $50 billion.
Musk is not aware of any guilty
Musk explained he didn’t do anything wrong and be sad and disappointed about the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written his more than 22 million Twitter fans that he might take the company from the stock exchange and pay $420 per share that funding was secured.
Tesla would have been assessed at $72 billion.
Later Musk returned: Tesla remains on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla will now have to find a foreign chairman, hire two independent board members and establish a committee that monitors Musk’s communication.

Surveys: 46% don’t want Merkel to be Chancellor by 2021
After the clusters of the past few weeks, the GroKo has taken several survey depths.
The SPD falls back in a survey behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overcome the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the image on Sunday in the country for the first time.
In the weekly survey of the Opinion Research Institute, the AfD decreases by a counter to 17 percent, the SPD decreases a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27%.
This is the deepest value for the Union on Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15%, the left 11 and the FDP 10%.
If on Sunday’s Bundestag election, the government parties would receive SPD, CDU and CSU only 43% of the votes together, according to Emnid.
Thus, the great coalition has lost the majority in the Sunday question at all major research institutes, except Allensbach.
Government parties continue to reach 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51%).
At the 2017 Bundestag elections, they received 53.4% together.
The bandwidth is also large among the other parties: the AfD, in several surveys, is 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach vote shares from 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is an average of 10 percent, while the FDP is 9%.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down depending on the vote share.
But also the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has declined significantly since the Bundestag elections in 2017.
Currently only 48 percent of citizens find that Merkel is the right in the board, according to the Emnid survey on behalf of BamS.
Only each second (50 percent) wishes to be current, according to the survey, that the major coalition will hold in three years until the next regular Bundestag election, 41 percent are for a new election.
Even in a further survey published Saturday, there were significant losses of popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also assess whether Merkel should again be candidated for the CDU presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47% are against it.
As a result, 64% of the EU candidates do not wish a candidate, 35% do not wish.
Add to Aldi: Reduced Price for Love Luck
Will Aldi be Tinder 2.0?
Whoever says that in times of Tinder there are no romantic meetings anymore - he should talk about potato meat at Aldi sometimes.
Munich - In times of digital “fastfood dating” by Tinder and Co., the supermarket is an anachronic romance for great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced puppy meat, boxershort swing at the washing table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than just a swipe to the right.
The app Tinder is in reputation to be less a contact, but rather a clueful exchange.
We’ve dared the test: How do women react to not talking about the hot grid right away in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
Right Hollywood Lovestory Potential is then if love happiness precedes an out-of-the-eye-lost-and-re-founded plot.
If the guy still reports on the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, it sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the copyright of this announcement in an unknown Aldi firm that she will also find her dream man with whom she has spoken shortly about the “30 percent reduced organic puppy meat”.
For the faith in the magic of analog learning, she definitely deserved her Happy End à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 covers for a life without paralysis

The cause of polyomyelitis, the polyovirus, can so far be isolated only by vaccinations, as it is said in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for goddess
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion on Mario Götze's form and fitness.
“We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that’s not good for us,” said Reus, friend of goddess, after the 4:2 win in Leverkusen at the TV channel Sky.
Zorc had emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not a simple situation.

Football: District League: Researchers appear VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season, where Alois Fetsch went to the court with his hard ones.
Wordcarg gave himself, coach of the VfL Wolbeck football district, withdrew (inside) to feel about the lack of readiness to perform on the green.
All story.
In the meantime, it's going back around the firehove path.
Taufrian evidence is 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrhein, which in the past game time only has passed the ascension.
Yes, I'm very satisfied with the appearance.
“We made the rooms narrow and pressured the ball.
That could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and looked for everyone for the match to simply say "thank you" for so much counter against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerich (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg came - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly over into a 4-2-3-1, where Niklas Thewes was waiting for balls in front.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerich's before his out (17th), the changed Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed leadership.
It would almost have been repented when the SCA in Minute 41 equally twice in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbauer dangerously rolled up in front of the Wolbecker box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his field.
After the break, the VfL took over full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed shortly.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes at a Thewes entry.
With the change of Miles Geske, the left-wing fetch missed a fresh cell course again.
When Oldenrhein Chris Nabertreemer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhue, there was an indirect free shock for the square lords 18 meters ahead of the guest’s housing.
The fould took on himself and demonstrated his danger with standards.
Westhues' thing with the right slide struck down the bottom left from the shooter's view - 1:0 (71.).
Twenty minutes that should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck fled the leather in the criminal room unfortunately to the hand in the 80th minute.
Arbitrator Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately showed the point.
Jannis Schneider did not escape the gift (79.).
Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase before Geske had the victory hit on the push in the 87th minute of twelve meters.
Maybe it would have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4:1 against Hannover 96
Four points after five days of play - that could not be enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintrach Frankfurt finally wanted to take care of the first home victory.
Ante Rebic, who was injured in the start-up for the first time, should help.

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women Remain Rare in Corporate Boards
Only 8% of the boards were female at the date of 1 September, as shown in the report "The Power of Monoculture", officially presented on Monday by the Allbright Foundation and the German Press Agency.
“The companies will have to stand up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass through them,” said Foundation’s business leader Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, Britain or Sweden, purely male-occupied leadership teams - with few exceptions - have long been unthinkable.
The residue makes the German competitors less diverse, innovative and future-oriented.
It is another corporate culture.
The slight increase in the share of women among German stock exchange companies is also due only to positive impulses in the companies of the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8% of the boards are female.
However, last year, the value was 3.8 percent.
With the 30 Dax companies - in the past few years - the women’s share stagnated.
Lastly, 26 women worked in the boards.
"I'm sure Dax companies will recruit women again next year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would not continue to make a self-obligation to increase the share of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture occurs at the Supervisory Boards: on 1 September the proportion of women was 30.5 percent – 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"When you recruit as many women for the boards annually, it would have reached 40 percent in 2023," the report said.
Some even make mice: luxury carosses: Which manufacturer earns most per car?
The best Ferrari deserves.
With each Ferrari sold, the Italians earn 280,000 euros and earn 69,000 euros.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Whoever makes the most wins among the noble providers per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much are the luxury manufacturers per car selling?
This question has been "Autopapst" and Economic Professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
In the first half of the year, Ferrari gained 69,000 euros with every car sold, but Jaguar Land Rover only reached around 800 euros, and Tesla and Bentley even put strongly on it for every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are good in the race with average prices of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros earnings before interest rates and taxes.

The 29-year-old note doctor was also able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another call-in notician tried to do so - but without success.
The three injured were brought to hospitals.
The police in close coordination with the prosecutor’s office in Bonner determines who bears the blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we uncomfortablely
After the blamable Aus in the League Cup, Manchester United is now losing in the seventh round of the Premier League.
West Ham United is subject to ManU 1:3. The way of defeat may still be given to talk.
The scene was symbolically in the 74th minute when the regenerate Marko Arnautovic for West Ham shot the 3:1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had allegedly returned the Red Devils.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel’s passport, all Manchester’s defense players remained, and Arnautovic let the ball pass through all the time in the world at the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative highlight of a previously inadequate performance over vast distances.
This is a very different situation at the United City Rivals of Manchester City.
Mourinhos’ large competitors Pep Guardiola trained citizens came towards Brighton & Hove Albion at an approximate 2:0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the defense rod for the home team for the first time.
Sergio Agüero provided a good hour and a double pass with the former gate sniper for the guarantee of the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus for the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri fighted a 1:1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
Like the Cup Out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man among the Londoners.
The hit of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained the only hit of the game until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his slender.
After the reds were launched with a flawless balance sheet in the week, Chelsea wasn’t going to beat for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the remis in the league, the Blues Liverpool also dropped from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (in front of Watford) celebrated 2:0 victories.
The fans of the Gunners who played through Granit Xhaka, however, had to be patient against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire until the 81st minute.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unfortunately entered Alex Iwobi’s own gate, but only two minutes later, Mesut Özil made the decision with his third seasonal hit.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to the fifth consecutive victory and lies just behind the great rival Tottenham on the fifth rank, leaving a strong impression of Wolverhampton under his Portuguese trainer Espirito Santo.
The wolfs remained unbeaten at 2:0 against Southampton in the League for the fifth consecutive time and ranked the 8th place.
VW core brand missing: Paris automotive salon in the sign of diesel debate
The Paris Automobile Salon takes place every two years with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic but all-in-one: the diesel scandal and the ring of driving prohibitions and rearrangements are probably not allowed by the German car companies at the meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 automotive salon, they show their newness from the next week, together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel no longer plays a big role in this.
However, the possible exchange and replacement offers for diesel owners in Germany, who are expected to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should still be an important topic at least behind the brilliant scenes of the fair states.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have their first pure electrical models, among other things: the e-tron of the Ingolstädters is expected to come on the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarters 2019.
Both were officially presented.
BMW’s iNext will be launched until 2021.
The center in Paris is the new 3rd.
Overall, more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle builders and numerous mobility and software providers are also present in their own halls.
This year’s 120th birthday trade fair will take place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a million visitors came.
In the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami, at least 380 people have died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first earthquake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communications and traffic connections are damaged, there was huge harm in matters.
After the earthquake, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds of people had gathered on the beach for a festivity.
It is worried that the numbers of victims are still going to be clearly high.
The numbers so far are only from Palu.
However, many other municipalities are also affected - along the west coast of Sulawesi.
About 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne on Sunday, with a helper team, celebrated the final service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Werdohl - The place in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the biker’s final service was on the program.
Frank Schröder is responsible for the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and therefore for the serious concerns of the PS-powerful two-bike drivers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle divine service (MoGo) will always take place on the last Sunday of the month at the Haus Nordhelle.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the peace church in Eveking.
There, on Sunday, around 150 bikers were gathered to do anything other than ordinary worship.
From 10 a.m., the Bolides were arranged in front of the church's entrance portal.
First, the biker spring shopper was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cakes or even with a deep curryworst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also involved.
The preaching held during the Biker-God-Service Pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
For the musical underpainting, Singer-Songwriter Valerie Lill.
“Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill suggests rather poeticly calm tones,” said Pastor Frank Schröder.
This was also a novel in the history of the motorcycle divine service yesterday.
Domestic fellowship celebrates a great party: After the apple, milk comes
Also on the actual day of action, Boris was active.
She supplied her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Great interest also awakened Georg Hartmann-Niemerg.
He had his apple press in the luggage and demonstrated his amazing viewers step by step the process from the mature apple to the apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Neimerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples into the large grinder.
With a little muscle strength, a finely cracked mass became from the apples.
Many of the children couldn’t imagine how it should once become a tasty drink.
However, they were also able to look at this important step of work this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in forms and enveloped by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces layer for layer over each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of work was not so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice went gradually into a large vessel.
However, the farmer had already finished specialities.
Thus he opened his "Schatzbox" and presented the latest spring white to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Fuchtorf" was correspondingly large.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came into conversation, while the children were not only able to pursue the process of apple press, but also discovered the built hupfburg for themselves.
Actives of the Füchtorf’s Commandership of former soldiers also engaged in the party and invited some stations to play shortly.
Even next year, the home association will offer an action day.
Then, however, as emphasized Gregor Krützkamp, the home house in the heart of the Spargeldorf will not be the place of happening.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This also lies on the hand because of the topic: After all, it will go around the milk.
1:4 Against Frankfurt: Hannover with the fourth season: "Shipped Situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga lower situation, trainer André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around himself and told them courage.
However, there were many positives previously not seen at 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a fucking situation, but you have to get out there as a team," 96-football professional Pirmin Schwegler said, "that's of course disappointing, because you always think a lot of itself."
The continued victoryless Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) met to connect, stand below with two counters and are a decline candidate in their current constitution.
Led by Ante Rebic, on the other hand, Frankfurt celebrated the first season home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored the gates for the DFB Cup winner, who, after the successful general sample for the European League match against Lazio Roma with seven points in the midfield of the table.
Croatian vice-world champion Rebic was almost involved in every dangerous offensive of the Hessen and never managed by Hannover’s defense.
The long-running stormer after the World Cup showed with his pace and enforcement capacity why he is so valuable for the unity.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan borrowed by FC Liverpool was also the first time in the beginning of the Frankfurter formation, who began with a swing.
A fake headball by Lucas Torró (17th) on the gateway grid put it in danger for the first time.
Six minutes later Sébastien Haller was stopped in the last moment of the 96-defense around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer.
The guidance for the householders fell almost inevitablely and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball after a defeated corner into the criminal room, Haller extended by head in front of the gate, where Ndicka only needed to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga matchman for the defense player coming in the summer by the French Second League AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt was still in front of the break.
This time Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who was able to start up and gave Michael Esser no chance.
In the middle of the time, Hannover’s coach responded to the weak imagination of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
Although the Lower Saxony played a little more courageous forward, flaming ideas remained shortly before the end, as the connection hit still managed.
The Hessens were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then placed on De Guzmán, who only had to pull the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was only scenes for the Frankfurters against overwhelmed guests, even Jovic met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes a party mile
Despite cool temperatures, good mood remained at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The Munich mayor Dieter Reiter achieved it before millions of people at the opening of the 185.
Munich Wies'n with two beatings last week.
Geisingen: Geising Christians celebrate Holy Cross-Fest
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on September 14th or Sunday afterwards.
The religious service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Heilig-Crusade church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross church houses the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year-old war, on which a Swedish soldier, according to the legend, has shot.
Then blood flows out of the shot wound.
From this, a great pilgrimage developed to the shooted Christ, which also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not completed until today, only the altar room stands, the lack of the long house is indicated by the trees.
In his preaching, Pastor Adolf Bühl reminds him that the cross is a sign of hope, consolation and life.
The worship was poorly visited despite the importance of the Geisinger parish.
After worship, the procession to the Holy Cross church was held and the church part of the Crossfest ended with the final blessing.
For many years, the Catholic church choir invites then to the secular part of the festival to the Catholic parish.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food and a wide range of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm ice.
In the afternoon, the parish community offered tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish community about the damage to the façade, roof, sandstone work and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures that will move until next year.
After a few times, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is sure that the renovation comes more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has increased, but it has also been found more, which was only made possible by the inaugural appearance by means of glamour.
Socket putting work is completed, and natural stone work is to be started before winter, and we hope to be able to complete almost half of these works this year.
Opening: New home in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Danube-Iller Life Help opens a new home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That in Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" will be passed on to his destination - there were all the presents agreed at the inauguration date.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers who have already been living in the home of the Danube-Iller Life Assistance for some time are relying on the special architecture of the new construction.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger spaces and accessible access to all areas has taken Rudolf Bader into account in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer building was placed on the test stand for the residents with mobile phones: "The house had come into the years and was no longer contemporary in the equipment," Bader explained.
In 2016, the excavators started to remove the house.
The new building should be made as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, says the architect.
Life Help Danube-Iller opens new home
Around €4.6 million invested the life aid in the new construction.
The free state amounted to €2.4 million, the district of Schwaben €450000.
According to Architect Bader, the construction works have remained in the planned framework - timely as well as financially.
He also thanked the Chief Executive Officer of Life Assistance, Jürgen Heinz.
The spagate between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof design was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom of moving even without foreign assistance.
Likewise, the head of the social administration of the district Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: “The house is oriented to the special needs of its residents that need aids to be mobile.”
The residence and functionality have been well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real case of luck because it is no longer to acquire in today's situation."
Overall, the new residential house in Münsterblickstraße offers nearly 1500 square meters of space for 30 people with disabilities divided into three residential groups.
Pride is life aid business leader Heinz for the 11 full-time staff who are all employed by tariff.
Germany: Silently complains differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of the unity, SPD Deputy Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all people not to meet with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that pain after almost 30 years of unit.
We cannot be satisfied with these differences," the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Prepommern said to the "Dayspiegel am Sunday."
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that eastern Germans worked on average longer than people in West Germany, but 15 percent lower salary.
“I cannot explain this to anyone nearly 30 years after the German Unity,” Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this little dog end the Korea conflict?
The one-year Pungsan Hunting Dog is intended to smooth the waves between the two Korea.
In an effort to relax the relationships with Seoul, Pyongyang made South Korean President Moon Jae a gift in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon’s office reported on Sunday, the two approximately one year old dogs reached their recipient on Thursday.
They then passed the border site Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog feed to facilitate the animals to "accommodate".
The dogs with the thick white feather, thick ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The Friendship has announced the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in the middle of September.
Both countries also agreed to join international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympics and jointly apply for the 2032 Olympics.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test plant for missile drives.
Austria’s moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100-year anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this Memorial Year for almost ten months, numerous new books have been published, which mostly answered this question in the background of the last hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archive, announced in the magnificent "Imaging Book" of Austria, which will appear on 1 October.
New Week, New Chance for Government
Back to the matter - this is the unofficial motto for the working week beginning today of the Great Coalition.
Little an interview, little a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have lastly not mantraly summoned the "return to matters".
Some craftsmen, physicians, cashmakers, and otherwise working citizens in this country may have led to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and matter, but it is so.
If the Federal Government is now ready to devote itself to its job again - to govern - you shouldn't stop it with debates of terms now.
Whether Union and SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and blamages of the past weeks, it may be shown on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the Government parties will meet the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to regularly call up this round to remove conflict early; a teaching from all the dispute.
First, however, conflicting issues are on the agenda again with the diesel reequipment and the immigration law of professionals.
CSU Traffic Minister Scheuer wants to leave the car companies with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the duty of technical repair of older diesel.
While in the diesel crisis over the weekend, Union and SPD are still far apart from the planned immigration law.
The SPD calls for a perspective of residence for refused asylum seekers who work or do training.
The Union is strictly against the "track change" from the asylum system in the labour market.
So there will be again dispute among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not Equal and Equal has joined the GroKo, but three partners with some very different society images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a society that is so diverse and sometimes contradictory interests does not progress.
But in order to be constructive, dispute must not be rebuilt for party-tactic reasons on the question of being or no being.
It’s still about politics, not theatre.
Union and SPD should dispute, but always look at the reality of people.
What is feasible and useful for many?
This leading question makes it possible to pragmatically clarify both diesel and trace change questions - and thus gain confidence.
Especially this is why the people have to struggle now.
Mushroom checks work hours at Hartinger
Minister in Visier
Does the Minister of Labour only violate the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to look at this.
"Really, day and night," her legists worked at the Social Security Reform, an overwhelming social minister reported at the presentation of the Social Security Reform two weeks ago.
At the list-mushroom mandatary Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) puts on surprise - she now brings the matter to Parliament via a request.
She assumes that the minister only expressed her enthusiasm about the use of her team and wanted to announce no violations of the applicable service law in front of current cameras.
Nevertheless, she now has questions to be able to "free Har Tinger from any suspicion."
Police are looking for women’s liquor to a road
Marxgrün - Lange did not want police to speak about it.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been graved.
The route is still locked in the area of Marxgreen until Monday.
The investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with his guide, was finally able to limit the relevant spot to a few meters in several times of use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered in conjunction with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian Monumental Protection Authority.
For more than a year, the Prosecutor’s Office and Criminal Police Court have edited the missing case.
Repeatedly, a bicycle path has been blocked and investigated with sonar equipment in Marxgrün because the investigators suspected that Heike's body could have been dismantled here in the course of the new construction of the State Road 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: crawls in Barcelona before Catalonia year
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will be held for the first time.
But earlier it comes to crawls.
Separatists have not forgotten the police operation in autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, it came to clashes between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence advocates, among other things, with colour powder when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
About 3,000 police officers of Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues who were in use in the electoral locations last year in the referendum classified as illegal.
Attempting to prevent citizens from voting, there was also violence at the time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and central government security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the around 6,000 separatists had then tried with violence to break through the police chain, and officials, among other things, had advertised with colour bags and eggs.
Six people were arrested, 24 more were easily injured, the authorities said.
On Monday, the independence referendum will be held for the first time.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to separate the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under forced administration in autumn 2017.
Regional President Carles Puigdemont fled to exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also went abroad.
Several ministers of the regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, continue to be in sub-detention.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government entered office in May, the forced administration was terminated.
However, the new regional President Quim Torra also focuses on the “right to self-determination” of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westphalia: Collected ratelessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate torlos
Red-White Ahlen continues to go on the spot.
Even for the FC Gütersloh, there was only one 0:0 distinction.
The final light and the third latter unleashed them before 438 spectators in the Heidewald Stadium as gathered ratlessness.
The first half was badly overviewable by the entertainment factor.
Whoever prefers to get a beer or a breadworst could do this without concern.
There was no risk of missing a torch, because there was practically none.
First shot after half an hour
Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) shooting of the entire match in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - possibility had the Ahleners when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling forced to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the criminal space limit.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was in an early change.
Lars Schröder's storm had to be exchanged with injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mutzl was 18 meters little over the housing, and after an hour, the Güterslohers also appeared for the first time in offensive appearance.
After a ballery conquest by Matthew Wieckowicz, it went fixed.
The quickly presented counter about Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62.) with a laughing shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they laid a headball from Wieckovicz (66th) after a corner ball from former Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim Angelo Daut responded, initially brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mutzl (70th).
It resulted - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative, the Ahlenians did not accomplish.
Only in the 91st minute, Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but it didn’t have anything.
Angelo Daut then tried to draw out the positive thing: "I like we played to zero," but unfortunately the zero stood forward too.
"We weren't as dangerous this time as we were against woodwickets and that even though our opponent didn't want to play here," RW Ahlens Interimstrainer said.
Offensively, "shatched everything a bit like that" against a team "which just wanted to defend."
“I didn’t feel like we could get a countergate,” Daut said.
However, as a viewer, he didn’t feel like his team could shoot a gate.
The idea was too poor for this.
Reckenfeld Harvest Thanksgiving Market: Luckily there are enough creemers
This is delighted by Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfeld Tafelausting Centre for which these donations are intended.
The volunteers insured: “These donations remain in Reckenfeld too.”
To open up, the sky appeared brightly blue, and the place was still slightly empty, but that should still change throughout the day.
Because, "Here it's so beautiful, so we're here today," a visitor said.
The festival organizer Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with an ordinary prise humor.
For the couple Brockmann, which should actually be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in short term.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become sick.
But there are enough creemers.
And the "replacement" was not allowed to entertain the increasingly becoming visitors.
This came so well that later, some folk songs were chanted.
"Simply great," Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to place the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is excited about the many actives with their stands, including mostly associations.
“Really, there should not be something like a board at all,” he nevertheless thanked for the action of the men’s choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all who were in use at the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the Clean up action.
Our garden town is a colourful painting - here's something going on.
Then the Maicrone of Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück was removed with the help of the firefighters and brought to the winter quarter.
In many stages, it was worked for physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty was everything to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has lived in Reckenfeld for a year, has become creative in his decupier saw.
Furniture work, beer cover with background motifs and a lot more he had on offer.
A speciality offered three reckfields Imker: "Reckfields honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlütter.
The latter has another specialty.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
As the little Elsa had to access again and again, so well tasted the cake.
The society is that then allowed visitors to stay long until evening hours, even without the stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Local-political lubricants: No successful advertising for skate plant
In Lengerich, unknown people have probably announced in a very little favourable way to build a skate plant.
In several places there are corresponding lubrications, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been charged with damage.
In large letters, the three words “Skatepark für Lengerich” are plagued on signs, among other things, at the Gempt-Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reported that after the voting trade fair on 19 September, a corresponding writing on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt-Bistro was discovered.
Since the short message of his time was apparently left "only" with an edding, it could be removed easily.
“A few days later, but this time it was sprayed,” Rottmann said.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note gets this case just because several large companies are also called on the board of Lengerich.
If the skate plant is built, it will also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann of the urban field School, Sport and Culture, without name.
But it is well possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies on the lubricated board.
Local policies and administration have been dealing with the topic of skate plant for years.
After the old was destroyed at the LWL clinic, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the council expressed a majority for the fire park.
However, this thought was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
Late June followed a turn.
The members of the main and financial committee voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word has the city council.
This year’s decision will be made so that it could be built in a positive vote in 2019.
Aeronautical traffic is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European airline chaos in summer, German flight pilots see no signs of improvement next year.
“This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes,” said Matthias Maas, the German Press Agency before the aircraft summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures was the long-famous staff failure in European airlines, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve quick improvements for the coming year, but the training of new lots takes four to five years," the trade union said.
The market for finished-trained lots is empty throughout Europe.
Only in the Karlsruhe center for monitoring the upper German airspace lacked some hundred people.
Maas once again criticized that various air trade unions were not invited to the summit.
On Friday, representatives of the federal, the countries, the air carrier, the airlines and the airports come together in Hansestadt to address the causes of delays.
“If you want to talk about additional work compression and overhours, this will not go without us,” said the head of the GdF, who has many members at the German air navigation.
Maas once again was responsible for the EU Commission for the Lotsen Misers.
Traffic forecasts for the current regulatory period by 2019 have been too low.
The cost requirements and staff savings in national airlines are now fully in accordance with the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to engage in Brussels for regulations that "not even further deprive the air".
Currently, EU rules will be voted by 2024 and further exacerbations will be worried.
The EU is constantly exposed to lobby printing by the airlines.
"Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues now harvest exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hoped that the high delay costs of the airlines will turn into a rethink.
The GdF will only participate in improving the situation if the German Air Safety (DFS) offers a "voice training and future pact," Maas said.
The announced receipt of 120 lot students annually over the coming five years is just rich to compensate for age-related departures.
The necessary staff building is not connected with this yet.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for Group Reconstruction
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans to rebuild the group.
According to the will of Head of Thyssenkrupp, Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis group is to be divided into two independent societies.
Both companies should have their headquarters in Essen and be noted on the stock exchange.
There is no additional reduction in staff beyond the previously known cuts in the administration.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
These are ten representatives of the employees.
The final decision, however, is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.

Barcelona: Violence in Demos by police and Catalan independence supporters.
Two simultaneous demonstrations of Spanish police officers and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona have taken place in violent confrontations with numerous injured people.
According to the city administration, around 3,000 policemen from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, and about 6,000 independence advocates demonstrated.
The Catalan police have tried with a large bid to keep the two protest tracks away from each other.
According to the deployment forces, however, supporters of independence have repeatedly attempted to break the security lockdown.
They would have attacked the officials with colour and pitches.
According to Rangelei, there were also among the participants of the various protest trains.
According to safeguards, 24 people were injured.
Police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and assessment of colleagues
The police had, with their demonstration, wanted to appreciate the colleagues who had actioned nearly exactly a year ago against the independence referendum prohibited by the Spanish central government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they requested better salaries.
Spanish police and Guardia Civil members feel it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officials earn much more than they.
The demonstrators felt it as a provocation that the Spanish police officers demonstrated exclusively in Barcelona.
"Why have you come to protest here?" asked 55-year-old Catalan demonstrant Manel Perez from the AFP News Agency.
Only to provoke and celebrate the fact that they have spoiled us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearics who wanted to give his name only with Daniel returned the charge.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who have only done their duty last year: defending the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we do it in Barcelona because this is a large European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues were “not coming to provoke,” the police officer said.

Football: Juve trainer praises for top party: Ronaldo's best match
The Portuguese Star-Attacker has "played the best game this evening together with the half hour of Valencia," Juve Coach Massimiliano Allegri praised after 3:1 (1:1) - Victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the trainer, the expensive star purchased was also the decisive man in the main match against the persecutor without his own gate.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and it's good," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first gate - and from the moment we grew up.
Thanks to Ronaldo’s three gate templates, Juve rolled the game after the early remain through the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and dependent on the hardest persecutor earlier.
Real Madrid’s gateway hunter initially introduced the former Bundesliga Professor Mario Mandzukic, who provided leadership with a double pack (26/49).
And Ronaldo also prepared to hit defence chief Leonardo Bonucci (76), who just had to move in front of the gateway.
"He gives a lot of templates," the coach praised.
But, of course, Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record sniper.
"We have to become even better in serving him," the coach asked.
Best Juve sniper is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on his account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the overpower of Juventus seems to become even more oppressive.
Seven victories in seven games are the unclear series in Serie A. At 21 points, the master of the seven years later has already six counters forward to Naples.
The table range trained by former Bayer Coach Carlo Ancelotti was not unchanged against Turin.
But at the latest after the place referred to the already warned Mario Rui (58th), the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to come up against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the square after too hard.
“We played well against a good Naples,” commented the Turin Coach.
It was also possible to feel Emre Can.
The German national player went on to Juve.
The professional coming from FC Liverpool was involved in all seven league parties.
The midfield player also played in the Champions League party against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour" that Ronaldo was flying from the square at the 2:0 Turin victory and was locked for home game against Young Boys Bern on Tuesday.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly ridiculous appearance, Rapper Kanye West provided attention at the U.S. TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral-water costume provided for heads and question marks to the spectators.
The 41-year-old also announced a change of name on time to release his new album.
Let it be called “yes,” says the musician.
"The being, which was previously known as Kanye West," he tweeted in line with the deceased singer Prince, when he denounced his artist name.
The pseudonym, however, is not a news.
Already the 10th album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist explained that "yes" has a religious meaning for him.
“I believe ‘Yes’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means ‘you’,” says the rapper.
Football: Circleliga A1 Münster: Finally!
You got it!
Hoetmar’s trainer Averhage didn’t make a hell from his disappointment.
This was a weak game from us today.
The opponent was simply harder, we’ve put him in trouble as well as never.” Accordingly, the list of Hoetmarer’s possibilities is read thinly.
Degree two torch chances in 90 minutes, so games rarely can be shaped positive.
Football Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first passage, but the first used Maik Krause from an angle to early leadership (7.).
In the 43th minute, Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great preparation of crawler, he was free to stand.
The hosts had only a double possibility when Moritz Höne initially failed to Torsteher Jos Schumacher and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61.), and Heinz Linnemann (69.) spent all.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the gate line and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann could also not use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stocked the ball over the line, the match was decided (81.).
“We’ve been criticizing hard before, that was different today than in the last few weeks,” Florian Kraus said.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.

Football: Circleliga A2 Munster: Spektakeball in Albany: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think about it," he said.
"We didn't have access to this." He supposedly said the wings of Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably all the other green whites that relied on with a collective offensive.
He laughed: "A dirty victory," he still said, turned away and pulled his players from there on the other hand was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Welcome, after a duel of two teams, one, namely watching to play the championship, and the other, Albersloh, to fight the class hold.
With comprehensively mixed feelings, GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"This was our best seasonal performance," he says.
“As we come back after 0:2, as we stand against one of the top teams in the league throughout the entire game time, this was really phenomenal.”
The bitter it works that you need to go home with empty hands.
Lars Zymner's top tort hunter brought the hosts in leadership with his 12th seasonal hit (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this gate.
The 2:0 he placed on the left to Fabian Frähning (39.).
We knew it, but such a player cannot be completely taken out.
"This was already crazy what he has done," Lewandowski acknowledged the quality of the opponent envylessly.
Shortly before the side change, his own eleven gained the compensation: McGill's free strike sailed from the left between Hövelmann and Concordia gateways to the long Toreck (45th).
After the side change, it was again McGill who achieved the compensation (59.).
Afterwards, it went back and back.
It was a crazy, action-loaded game.
Nubel shocked again (64.), just five minutes later, like Patrick Horstmann (69.).
Despite the overwhelming number, Albersloh failed to recontain the last Concordia hit (80th).
Now we have to focus our full focus on Wednesday.
“The game against scap, that’s what we need to win now,” Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Frähning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nubels (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Renowned guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers approximately 80 meetings until the middle of the next year.
In the meantime, France’s President Emmanuel Macron has signaled to wish to pick up the tolerance price in Tutzing personally.
For Christian Wulff, the term was too short: as the Federal President he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was guest there.
The academy director Udo Hahn proudly said, “All Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us.” The fact that at the academy at the Tutzing Castle repeatedly appears renowned, but was also a topic at the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, lieder Konstantin Awacker participates in a meeting on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, on September 29, writer Frido Mann, at a meeting on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, France’s President Emmanuel Macron has also pledged that he wants to personally receive the “Tolerance Award” awarded by the Academy in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television moderator Dunja Hayali.

“The pension is not safe!” he says in a meeting title.
"SOS at the borders of Europe" - the Academy describes the "risk and deadly route over the Mediterranean".
"And at a meeting about Syria: "Barbarie without Limit."
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - the war confuses every human idea."
From structural racism in society to the scissors between poverty and rich, to the radical change in work through digitalization, the spectrum extends.
Academy Director Hahn convinced: “A free democracy needs places where a citizen society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions.”
At a 200 meeting.
Karl Marx’s birthday soon expects one more visitors towards capitalism criticism, others rather a tendency “from left out towards the middle.”
What does it look like neutrality?
“We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Landes Church,” said study director Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, “so we are not 100 percent neutral.”
Music Cabaret: Gender Communication with Heart - Wolbeck - Westphalische News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the room of the Christmas Church in Wolbeck.
As a Cabarettine, Teubner prepared gender comprehension, not only with humor and heart warmth for the (fetched) woman and the (fetched) man and whatever else may be, but also with music.
The mini guitar put her in and mastered her violin too.
On the wing was Ben Süverkrüp.
He is, on the one hand, the male saving ring partner, which sometimes comes to words even until the end of the sentence, on the other a true pianist: So congenially harmoniously accompanies Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wanted a solo.
It was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, that is, as it fitted to the red thread of the evening.
Then Teubner had brought a paradox in the game: the man’s satisfaction comes if he had a partner, but they didn’t open the door.
A closed door without a partner, however, does not benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates that: What would have come out of the composing of Mozart if "the Nannerl" would have opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus Süverkrüp passes through improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt full of blood and wounds" into the "Lied of death", and from Mozart's g-moll symphony into a playful dance.
There were great applauses and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers delivered Karlheinz Kleintje, the treasurer of the association, the chansonette.
However, Chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck could not take an additional thank you.
She had the idea of giving the duo alongside performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt also in Wolbeck.

Handball: Women's Landesliga: Ahlener SG retains white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlenians had problems especially with third-league player Carolin Stallmann, who marked ten hits alone.
“I was actually satisfied with the defense, only one player has made too many goals.
We haven’t managed them,” said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more angry about the many lost opportunities.
The concentration at the end was missing his team this time.
Therefore, the ASG ran behind almost a residue until the end, laid to the break at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45th) behind.
Only to the end, the wider bank of the hosts became decisive.
Additionally, Aydogdu placed Merle Klement on the left, which then made “extremely clever the decisive gates” (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top Performance of the BSV Eastern Bevern at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the BSV Ostbevern volleyball girls have again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd West League.
At the second-liga decreaser VC Allbau Food, the blue-white wined with 3:1.
“This was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz playing in the upper third of the league.
Now we’ve done that,” coach Dominik Münch rejoiced after his team’s almost unprecedented performance at the dropped table guide.
The first passage was dominated by the guests almost as they wish.
About 4:1, 16:10, and 22:12 he went to the vicemaster of the previous year at 25:15.
Food has been accepted in the two-roll but has not come into play.
We've been very busy.
Our opponent has set up with a high risk, but also produced a few tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led with 12:8. "Eating has changed the acceptance to three rods.
We couldn't keep the pressure.
“Eating has sucked up, and we’ve left a little indulgent,” Münch said.
At 18:17, for the first time the volleyball women from the Ruhr area had their nose forward.
Although Eastern Bebeverns refrained four set balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a better class," the exercise manager was at the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and, finally, Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV to turn the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Munich: “We played consistently and quietly.”
About 7:3 and 15:13 the blue white brought four passage to their side with 25:22.
Vera Horstmann was elected to be the most valuable player, but also Maren Flachmeier had taken a great day.
BSV women: Egghouse, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish Municipality: Mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way of the opening of the great Ditib mosque in Cologne by the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The mosque opening in Cologne has left a sharp cluster in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be hardly turned together," said TGD Chairman Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German side would have missed the opportunity for a common, reconciliatory appearance.
“Aside from German leading politicians to emphasize the belonging of Muslims to Germany, Erdogan has used the date for its purposes,” Sofuoglu said.
The widespread exclusion of the German public “strengthened many reserves.”
Home association Nottuln: Offer has already established
After the long summer break, there is finally the folk-treatment time again.
On October 18th (Tuesday) at 19:30 a.m., the home association Nottuln will organize its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace of the Old Amtmann.
Almost exactly on the day, it’s a year ago that we performed a folk meeting for the first time.
Meanwhile, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln,” says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our folk meeting is blind in Nottuln so quickly.
Whether deep storm Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace of the Amtsmanney was always fully occupied.
“The program at the next Folktreff is, as always, a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and sea songs, folk songs, Evergreens and old slagers,” Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites to Nottuln to repeatedly friendly musicians.
Klaus Spellmeyer pledged for the first "birthday" folk meeting with his accordeon.
He was a member of Gaitling for many years, a group from the neighborhood of Steinfurt who played music with plated German texts.
Now he's on the way with an Irish-Folk band.
Folktreff’s makers are pleased to remember the last event in summer, when Christoph Schulz from Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song “Frösche in the Night” enthusiastized the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
“We are expecting many happy guests to spend a society and humorous evening again,” the home association invites.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to engage actively is invited to participate.
Since the desired seats are always quickly occupied, it is recommended to be there in time enough.
The folk meeting starts at 19.30, but entry is already at 19.30.

From pure fruit to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125-year-old existence of the Circle Association for Gardening and National Care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show at the Kulmbacher Vereinhaus, the last founding impulses for the Circular Association for Gardening and National Maintenance Kulmbach were set, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a large anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
Of course, he was called differently at the time: as the "district agricultural association Kulmbach Stadt und Land" he was raised from baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-building association also differed from today's work - it was actually about fruit-building, flowers and gardening at the time no one thought.
“At that time, in the era of enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elite,” said Kreisheim Career Günter Dippold.
Fruit trees should lie on remote roads, so-called industrial gardens were installed in schools.
Today, the building is also responsible for the 55 gardenworking associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7,000 members.
However, the spectrum is far not exhausted.
Naturally gardening, biological plant protection, village beauty and nutrition plays as much a role as providing knowledge, healthy nutrition and youth work.
How versatile are the tasks of a gardenworking association, the members of the Hutchdorf Youth Group "Maulkubs" showed entertaining on stage.
“Youth work is urgently necessary in particular in the digital age,” said the circle chairman Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm, emphasized the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The gathering of castan was a huge thing for us kids, I doubt that you can gather like a lot of joy with smartphone & Co..
Schramm promised to plant two trees for the anniversary along with the land council of Klaus Peter Söllner.
"Where to stand, the circle association decides," Landrat Söllner added and emphasised the special importance of the garden associations for the villages.
The circle association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
That this is a genuine concern of the many garden associations in the district, also left no doubt of circle managers and expert advisor Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with a picture talk through the long history of the Circle Association and reported, among other things, of the need for self-support after the war.
Earlier everything came from the garden, for the winter it was endowed.
In the late 1950s, however, the utility garden turned into a decorative and residential garden.
“The nature has a presence, it has been there before us and we have to be oriented on it,” said the specialist for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, there is an encouragement for the garden associations not to refrain so that our home remains beautiful and worthy of living.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations, added the president of the Bavarian National Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
“We have to stop the eclatant decline in insects, that’s why we are guilty to our children and grandchildren,” Günter Reif concluded the successful festive act that was celebrately framed by the turmbells of the music association Thurnau.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister moves UN-Speech
Mexico’s government wants clarity in Nafta: they make both trade partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives the trade agreement absolute priority - and shifts her speech to the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure during the struggle about a re-edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has shifted her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of today’s Saturday, the minister will only speak before the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen announced.
Meanwhile, she focuses on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican economic minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that the negotiator Canada and the US would have 48 hours of time agreed if Canada would actually join the trade agreement already reached between his country and the US.
The U.S. and Mexico had agreed to a re-resume of the Nafta regional free trade agreement in August.
U.S. President Donald Trump said Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.

Until Sunday evening (local time) they will now be concluded, Trump’s government wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before October 1st.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico’s appointed President Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday to strive to a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro injured in a knife attack left the hospital.
The former right-wing military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, according to a report from the daily newspaper "O Globo", where he lives.
After his resignation, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will take public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked on open roads in the beginning of September during an electoral campaign event in South Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Elle no" (in German: "Not"), women's associations had called for protests against the former military.
Also in social networks, the associations against Bolsonaro mobilized racial and women’s violent statements.
In the Economic Metropole of São Paulo, several thousand demonstrators were expected.
In the capital Brazilian capital, the protests are mixed with a meeting of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Labour Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He came to the position of former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and therefore cannot be nominated.
The presidential elections in Brazil will be on October 7th.
As a former citizen of the million town of São Paulo, Haddad was in surveys so far behind the extreme right candidate Bolsonaro.
Although the "Trump of Brazil" has been mixed in political operation for a long time, it presents itself recently as an anti-system candidate.
None of the candidates reach absolute majority in the first round of elections, there will be a majority election on October 28.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro won't succeed in this - no matter who he argues against.
Bolsonaro is known for his defeat against homosexual and black and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Repeatedly, he shocked with verbal discharges.
Another time he said that the followers of Lula’s left workers’ party should be shot.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsen's website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician has been in treatment since early this year because of prostate cancer.
Larsen became familiar with the Gasoline band, which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is today the best selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen honored Larsen on Sunday in a statement as "road boys" who was "to everything but in all hearts".
He also recalled that monarchy opponent Larsen took place in 2010 at the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: Volume at press air hamper level
"We are here, take the bone saws and ignite a concert evening with the strength of a tiger." Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" put a rewriting of the rocky live musical experience on Saturday night in the hall of the city center Shohfabrik.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert start, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in combination with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loudly enthusiasts about 120 visitors to the "Mint Mosquito" night.
Even the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows to convince the start of the concert evening with the latest unknown pieces of his own spring and the nearly appearing CD.
Before the stage, the band will be danced as the voting and pressing match of the band during the appearance.
Although "Add-on" call is not to be overlooked, Tiger Bonesaw then leave the stage to the "Here We Stand" trio.
That Hardrock is not equal to Hardrock, demonstrating guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich am Bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternatives, sometimes reminding classic rock of the 1970s sounds.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" in addition to the "Here We Stand" guitar rock, in fact, also a synthesizer is used.
Not only does the desirable, pretty balladent "Take Me Home" make sense of switching from melodic passages to the guitar-loaded rock riffs of the multilayer songs.
However, the "The Ignition" quartet made of tonnischöschen has played a special degree of renownedness since its foundation in 2005.
Full agility, the band presents its hard rock on Saturday.
That "The Ignition" with its appearances before a large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis on the 2017 tour in China - has special stage experience, is obvious and unheartable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also plays his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 1980s.
For the sound that he felt even higher than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a surrounded solo while running through the audience.
A certain volume related to gender belongs to ei nem such a hardrock concert of course: At the Mint Mosquito Rock Night, according to the Mixpult team’s triple concert of Here We Stand, Tiger Bonesaw and The Ignition, it is approximately 98 decibels.
This is, for example, press air ham level, but therefore is still significantly below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitval", pointing to the "The Ignition" on their website.
However, the Ahlen audience does not need 120 decibels in nozzle drive volume as commonly used in the annual metal stationery in the north of the republic, at this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky movement have long been convinced with their sovereign, virtuous game and their own compositions.
“We stand here, we have taken the bone saws and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger,” all three groups can say, however, in the transmitted sense, at the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of visitors.

Trump says to Kim: “And then we fell in love”
That U.S. President of North Korea’s ruler Kim is quite comfortable in spite of nuclear crisis is no secret.
Now, however, Trump made a true declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim’s “beautiful letters”.
At the delicate age of 72, the married U.S. president has become a new flame.
The tragic thing: it is a remote relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un an unusual declaration of love.
Before followers in the U.S. state West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half so old splash of the ruler dynasty of Pyongyang, although it proved to be relatively tender broken in the wing of North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
“I was hard, he too, and between us it was going and going,” Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote to me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
His personal connection has also been politically fruitful: Trump pointed out the stop of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics see little more than lip confessions behind it so far.
That the affection for his famous martial threat "Rocket Man" - Trump's spitzname for Kim - should not be horrored by everyone - seemed to be quite aware of the U.S. president.
In any case, he took the anticipated criticism of this in his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling right away: “Donald Trump says they have fallen in love.”
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That's so unpresidential.
But he did not take care of this, Trump explained, and then directed his display finger to the crowd: “I’ve always told you that it’s so easy to be presidential.”
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people pushing out there into this full-filled arena, but we would have only 200 people standing out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Bests visited, atmospheric, and above all tired of sun: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfestflair, Baesweiler's city center was pushed out on Sunday.

Refugees Saved from Libyan Prison
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their disastrous detention conditions in Libya using a phone video, thus enabling their rescue.
The group had rotated the recording in its cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under risk of life and spread online.
"You refuse to send us back," a man in the video message said.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alarmed the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flew to Nigeria at the end of August.
“Without the video, we wouldn’t have been able to return to Nigeria,” said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, from the AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya when he attempted to reach Europe through the Mediterranean.
With the video, he put himself in danger of life according to his own statement.
One of his co-fighters was almost beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the detention conditions were catastrophic: "They hit us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary return of refugees who are stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were returned to their homes this year using the program, IOM spokesman Jorge Galindo said.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the poor detention conditions in Libya.
He hasn’t heard of a help call via phone video yet.
International organizations have long been criticizing states in Libyan refugee camps as inhuman.
The North African state, which is dominated too much of militia, is the main crossing country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.

Laschet urges the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne, NRW Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has in discussion with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own statement, advocated the rule of law in Turkey.
The relationships of the two countries are currently “overshadowed,” Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This is mainly the waves of arrest, the freedom of the press and the freedom of religion.
He has therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relationships are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for it.
According to his own statements, Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression be respected.
Erdogan once again emphasized the independence of Turkish justice.
The conversation of Laschet and Erdogan has been moved to a building of the Federal Defence Ministry's flight readiness at the Cologne Airport in the short term.
Originally, it had to be held at the Castle Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected it from political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan continued to travel to the opening of the Ditib mosque in Cologne after the conversation.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
He said, "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contact persons - not the Turkish president.
Lack of trust in the U.S.: North Korea demands disarmament
While U.S. President Trump is not tired of emphasizing the success in the negotiations on North Korea’s denuclearization, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington's meeting.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the U.S. government of the UN General Debate to block the negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its ongoing sanctions.
"The latest stop is therefore that the United States relies on forced measures that are deadly for trust-building," Ri said in New York.
A disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
“Without any confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way to disarm ourselves as the first,” the North Korean Chief Diplomat said.
That North Korea could "force the knee" penalty is "a dream of people who do not know us."
In order to build trust, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear system, Ri stressed.
However, there were no “equivalent reactions” on the US side, the minister said.
Due to North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council alone has decided three times on sanctions against the internationally isolated country.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo in recent days urged the United Nations to strictly comply with criminal measures.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on an approach.
In June, Trump had first met North Korea’s ruler Kim Jong Un.
Following the first summit in Singapore, the U.S. president will seek a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will again travel to Pyongyang to talk about the end of the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
That they actually were in a youth meeting, of which the many visitors to the house of the open door HoT received nothing: white ceilings and flower jewellery on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after the harvest thanks service.
The HoT teens had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank for food.
The start with the new facility was not just easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had our refrigerators already before the summer break filled with food and ingredients and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break the evil surprise came: an electricity failure had set off the huge, two-piece refrigerator, the food was corrupt and had to be removed.
"Now we had to start again from the beginning: although we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, the children and young people wanted to do it alone," Westbuer said.
And so they all packed.
The result could be seen, the guests were excited.
"It can't be better cooks," a visitor praised, while Hokkaido soup was served or the guests were allowed to serve quiche, liver cheese or cakes.
“It’s really great what the children and young people have put on their legs,” emphasised Pastor Frank Beckmann, while the wizard Stephan Lambs made surprises with card tricks and other pieces of art.
Jürgen Sator leaves NRW of the Table
With frustration about criticism from his own rows, the head of the Essener Table, Jörg Sartor, issued his post in the Landes Association.
Sartor became known nationwide because the Essen board had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He resigned as vice-chef of the NRW boards in July, said Sartor the "World am Sunday".
Too many of me have fallen in my back.
The head of the NRW Tablen-Landesverband, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed understanding of the decision of his long-standing deputy.
The criticism took Sartor.
"I can understand his step - people who didn't know exactly why the Essen boards do that."
But Sartor is still active for the Essen board - "six days a week, because nothing changes," said Weilerswist.
Sartor in turn criticized colleagues from other boards in the "World am Sunday".
One cannot follow the approach, “without us the people in the city will be hungry.”
It is the task of the state to ensure that people are not hungry.
The Essener did not participate in a congress on Friday in Berlin.
"There's too much sweet thing to tell me," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis that criticized me at the time.

SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Nearly a year after the marriage entered into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave the jawort on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered living partnership had not come into question for them, Kahrs had previously said the "Bild" newspaper.
"If we get married, then right." He's been together with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesman of the SPD Bundestag Group and one of the spokesmans of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD flight.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, on June 30, 2017, Kahrs excited an anger.
He accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of being “injured” on the topic.
“This was your Schabowski moment,” he said in a random statement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
They had previously been able to register their living partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the law of adoption.

There was a lot of work before the members of the Citizens’ Association Children’s House and the Society for Lepra.

Due to the hot summer, we are late this time, but luckily, it's just a shape section.

“All of them should remain in force,” Walter Schröer said.

The 29-year-old launched a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympic Bronze for three hundreds of seconds.
I was well prepared, had enough rides on the plant here and everything has fitted today,” the London Olympic Third said in 2012.
In the goal, he threw his paddle away from joy and turned both arms victoriously to the height - well knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.

Luckily the perpetrators failed.
The days are going to be shorter - that will be used again by breakers.
Thus, the police inspection Gauting reported yesterday the first attempt to invade this autumn.
That it remained at the single-family house on the Königswieser Straße attempt is due to the alarm system.
It went on when the perpetrators put their hands on Friday just before 20:00.
The invaders really knew that the inhabitants were not at home.
But the alarm system apparently surprised them so much that they took the escape without prey.
Notes to the PI Gauting, Phone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Pleite at Hertha: Recognized by reality: Bavaria Required Against Ajax
The predict is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin wants FC Bayern to "not fall."
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate facility for Niko Kovac's term.
The first small performance dial under the new coach Niko Kovac is not to be increasing to the larger autumn depth for the Munich people.
“A week ago we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now we have a little bit of the reality,” said Thomas Müller after the earned 0:2 downside at Hertha BSC and asked for a reaction to the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Whoever knows us knows that this is really annoying us and we give gas towards Tuesday.
For the first time for more than a year, no own gate shot outside, as at the same time of the previous season, two mandatory games in series without victory, the table leadership in the football club previously lost Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation has not long been as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record master must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its laufintensive Mann-on-Man-Tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle sticks over the outside have delivered within three days equal two blue pauses, as the latest surpowerful Bavarians are to be cracked.
“Those who know FC Bayern know that we don’t like it and we’ll do everything to succeed again,” Kovac said.
Otherwise, he went surprisingly gently around with his losers in his birth town and scored his first defeat as a Munich coach merely on the lack of dealing with opportunities again.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still make the first intermediate facility of his term be positive before the country’s pause – otherwise the sound would likely be exacerbated.
Thus, Kovac did not take no extraordinary measures before the second royal class appearance of this season after 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After Sunday’s free day, the short preparation for the second pre-round match against Ajax, which had also conquered AEK Athens with 3:0, begins as planned.
"Now it's gone to us in two games, but we're going to make our gates again," National Team Captain Manuel Neuer announced.
Just like after the lost final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke cleartext.
The legal defender appeared in the role as a reminder.
"I don't think that's all bad, we've got to work it again because we don't make the many opportunities and make the mistakes behind," the 23-year-old said just before departing from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous game time, the Bavaria even had five counters behind Dortmund, which now took the peak again with a point of advance.
And so Kimmich at least positively valued that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now ended.
“Yes, that’s good,” the national player said.
It's good for the league.
Boss of the DFB in Shooting Line: Özil Cause: Scarf Attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With heavy allegations, Turkish President Erdogan claims an exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for interpretation highness in the permanent dispute topic Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president to open the large Ditib mosque in Cologne heavily criticized the deal with the former World Champion in Germany, the DFB Chief defended the association line.
On early Sunday morning, Grindel personally sharply attacked at the Mainzer ZDF "Sportstudio" announced consequences from the cause.
“In the future, because we have many players with migrant background in the U teams, we have to draw very accurately conclusions that such a thing doesn’t repeat,” said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without migrant background as a further integration official.
At the same time, Grindel once again explained that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and DFB.
He had complained with sharp words a racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our born and grown Mesut Özil in Germany and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they allowed them to photograph with me in England,” Erdogan said Saturday in the Domtown.
Honestly, as her president, I could not digest that our two young men, who went up to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan’s statement that, unlike Özil, after the World Cup affair, which had started with Erdogan by photographs of the two, he felt “reasonablely treated by the DFB.”
At the same time, he announced to want to stand before players in the future.
Someone says, "If I win, I'm a German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - that can't."
“I’m very sorry that he has such an impression,” Grindel said.
We had to defend Mesut more, I've always said.
But he doesn’t see a foundation for returning Özils to the national team.
As a result, along with the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, will now be called an additional integration officer.
"If someone with no migrant background is clearly involved in society and football and says, 'The topic is important, we need to take care of', that would also be an initiative to ensure a better foundation for our local associations where integration must work," Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup exit and the Özil affair, he wants to reappear for the office as the DFB president next year.
"I'm doing my job and trying to do it as good as it's going," Grindel said.

Your wishes are then available in the event of Swisstransplant.
The new procedure doesn't change that institutions can continue to be taken - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
It is expected that 15% of Swiss people have a donor ID, says Franz Immer, director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases a card will be found at the decisive moment in possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
“Then you have to decide in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdening,” says Ever.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
There are considerations in Germany to store information on the possible organ donation on the healthcare card, as spokesman of the Federal Center for Health Enlightenment says Marita Völker-Albert.
"A register in which people can enter their wishes - per or contrary organ donation - there is nothing," she says.
Federal Minister of Health, Jens Spahn, pronounced a new regulation of organ donations.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be considered organ donor, unless he or his members oppose.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is World Champion in Headqualification
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is a world champion in the head.
On the weekend in Wolfsburg, he ran against 39 co-conflicts.
Martina Flame-Jasper announced on Sunday from the Science Museum of Phaeno, the place of exhibition of the competition.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Greetings from Germany occupied the third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as chief army judge Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor in Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
For example, previous tasks were: 14,130 214 x 17,981.822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Since viewers were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon where participants came against guests from the audience with pocket calculators.
Wenzel demonstrated greetings from lastrup how he holds a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for competition.
Greetings have been in Bielefeld two years ago than 14-year-old.
With terms such as superbrain, genius, or miracle child, organizers Laue can start little.
“They can train your head account,” he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even computing competitions focused on stages.
The disciplines include, for example, the square root drawing from six-digit numbers.
The candidates receive surprise tasks for which they quickly need to find a solution strategy.
The Germans also had good opportunities here, the chief arbitration judge said.
Otherwise, Asians are often advantageous because there, in the early childhood, header calculations are learned more intensely and with other effective methods.

Polar cold air brings snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle shake her beds in the west for the first time: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit at the beginning of the week drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters – in narrow valleys, it could snow down to approximately 1,000 meters at strong intensity, it said.
From Bregenzerwald to the Hohen Tauern, 20 to 40 centimeters of new snow is expected above 2,000 meters.
On higher-situated passes (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertfarmers, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) therefore, the road conditions become winterly.
Farmers are allowed to start with annual knick care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein’s farmers are allowed to begin with annual knick care on Monday.
The unique "green walls" in Germany have shaped the landscape of the poor federal country for about 200 years.
The up to five meters wide tree and straws are "walder replacement" and for many animals and plants the last retreat spaces.
Knicks combine habitats scattered as corridors through which the exchange of organisms can still work, as said the managing director of the German Nature Protection Association (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski.
Knicks are living boundaries
The Knicks were created on the basis of a command of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, which ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living edges" were not only field limiting and cattle edge, they also supplied the farmers wood and beams for their specialized houses.
From that time, his name “Knick” also comes from: due to “knicks” of the easts, the dense, connected delimitations could develop.
Today, between the northern and the Baltic Sea, around 45,000 kilometers of hives extend and give the picture of a varied structured landscape.
According to the NABU, around 7000 species of animals are now used as a replacement living space.
In a kilometer of knick, up to 1800 different species could live and break up to 30 birds pairs.
Its ecologically important function, however, can only fulfill the knick if it is maintained accordingly in winter.
Otherwise, he will confuse to a light tree row, which also loses wind protection in addition to biodiversity, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, knick care may only be operated outside the gross period from October to March.
Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about local situation
In the interview with the editorial network Germany (RND) the local situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Have you been on site during the tsunami itself?
No, I was just in Jakarta at that time on Java Island.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called to me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because after a flight I had to drive more than 20 hours of car because the airport was closed at the time on Palu.
What is the situation on the island now?
The National Government has reopened the airport so that help goods can also be flighted.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that are all completely destroyed.
Our "World Vision" office is also destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have housed other people as well.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many are running on surrounding hills, where they still endure from fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they don’t have access to water and food.
Some stand up in front of their homes, there are still tremors.
Because many food shops and also the fuel stations are completely closed, people are partially clogged food and gasoline.
The public service has been completely shut down, the national government helps out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners are partially running freely, and searching for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island?
At the moment we have phone reception, but before that it didn’t work and we only received information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors, and others, whom they don’t know if they live and where they stay because people were not at home during the earthquake, but on the job, for example.
The tsunami warning system has not worked properly.
Do you have information about it?
We don’t know the reasons, but when the warning came, many thought “okay, no tsunami” – and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was a misinformation that a tsunami is hit the region and they are running to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Fire Ring not prepared for earthquakes?
There are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must long refrain from Aogo and Donis
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo at 2:1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday attracted a muscle fiber rise in the back left thigh, the football club said on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games even after the following country pause.
A forecast of the failure time was not given to the VfB Stuttgart.
A muscle bundle rise usually cures within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber rise usually cures a little faster.

In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to pick up the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Pyeongchang Olympic sprint to grab near the medal.
Seven tenth seconds lacked bronze at the end.

The Pinzgauer is more motivated to repeat the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a major event with the Constitution, win something.
Sometimes you have to beat too.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI survey in turbotempo
Time is extremely short and the number of planned hearing is very limited.
With a turbotempo FBI investigation, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the thin majority for the controversial judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline until Friday to inform the alleged incidents that were more than 30 years later.
The recent turn in the drama about the appeal accompanied by a cultural struggle Kavanaughs was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing from Kavanaugh and the first accusator Christine Blasey Ford, in the course of which the lawyer expelled angry tiradas against the oppositional Democrats, the Senate’s judicial committee should free the way for the final confirmation of the Conservative Judge at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of the Republicans seemed secured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared he would agree against his original announcement, but required an FBI investigation.
According to tumultuous scenes, his parties agreed.
President Trump, who had called the heavy pretensions on Thursday as “beschiss”, initially contained further attacks against women and spoke on the contrary of “happiness in disaster”.
In this way, the last doubts could be removed, he said.
Trump later attacked the Democrats sharply in a election campaign because they refused Kavanaugh: “They are trying to block and destroy.”
Trump orders FBI investigation in Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of the investigators.
One will be targeted to investigate the known accusations of two women, no longer, a government representative told the Wall Street Journal: “They don’t go on a fishing trip.”
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses will be heard.
The mobile, installed in a "civil vehicle" radar device of the city community Ried for monitoring the speed limit, according to the city community, is stationed on the garden road from Monday, 1 October.
There is also the federal school center.
The municipality also operates several fixed installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You Fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is large after the first season win.
Nevertheless, the factor of time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - Meanwhile, Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football games.
This was not different in the home game against Mainz 05.
“I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and lots of balls in our criminal room," said Schalke 04's sports board and breasted.
Finally, the king’s blues still succeeded in bringing the scarce 1:0 against the Rhine Hessen over time and thus the first seasonal victory under the roof and track.
It could have actually happened differently.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11. the team of chief coach Domenico Tedesco had given security: "In sum, the first half-time was good, both playful and pressing."
Doesn’t create a headball monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," Heidel said, "if the team was just half as nervous as I was on the bank, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore they continued to withdraw.
And with man and mouse defend against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
“We’ve all fallen a huge stone from the heart,” Schöpf said, who didn’t have an essential share of this with his headball hit: “That’s why I’m actually the worst headball player in mankind.”
But in the end, only the victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start with pressure in the beginning stage and make it a fireworks," Schalke's chief coach said.
The victory was important.
We can finally look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligent, quiet and courageous, so we have to go to matches over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest manco of the afternoon: Royal Blue missed it to be worried rather for clearer conditions.
Finally, the possibilities were there, for example through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
“Then it wouldn’t have become a victory of the zipper,” Tedesco said, “you have already felt the fear a little bit.”
That's why I'm glad we've won.
He wasn't the only slaughter.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: a discussion at the height of the eye
The author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani, stands ahead of them.
He repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it a task for many years to bring interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfeld Meetings" - that association who cooperates in the orientation of the evening with the alliance "Culture Policy".
El-Mafaalani goes very quickly into the reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic understandably.
With a lot of gestures, hand-resistant numbers and jokes, it brings listeners closer to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why, despite successful integration, there are increasing conflicts?
The Syrian author serves in answering the question of a metaphor.
On one table the German society sits, on the cat table the first generation migrants.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to be at the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they always sat at the big table and now want to decide.
This leads to conflicts.
It is therefore not crucial whether you are politically arranged on the right or on the left, but: “I am for or against an open society?”, he emphasizes.
Initially behave rather, then the round of discussion is always going on.
And there is need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration with students.
El-Mafaalani is present, not on stage, a symbol of discussion: it is at the height of the eyes.
The sociology professor does not urge his opinion, emphasizing that he speaks of the average, not of individual destiny.
He is pleased that there is an interest in the topic because “first when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions,” says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signature hour he was also discussed an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, in prepared Kurdish specialities, further intensely.

Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The need is apparently huge: over 100 stakeholders have advised to purchase one of the land in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first land in the Landsham-Süd New Building area on the free market.
Mayor Roland Frick said that.
Furthermore, the application phase is completed for those 20 lands that the municipality offers at favourable conditions or prices - similar to the previous local model.
There have been 100 applications, says Frick.
"The documents are currently examined" in terms of application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the Mayor of Pliening, the objective is to create the candidate list for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit it to the municipal council.
Then the award can be made.
In total, 50 plots for single and double houses are created on the area in the south of Landsham, as well as four areas for multifamily houses with eight residential units.
The development is now as well as completed, and the roads and paths are to be asphalted soon.
A single ground and two of the multifamily houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells most of the free market, 20 plots in socially compatible model.
The two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built as an affordable living room according to Frick.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments supported by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Grow estimated on the area of the Landsham-Süd New Building Area is created living space for about 200 people.

It is intended to accommodate three children’s garden and three crystal groups as well as a multi-purpose space.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, for the launch of the next kindergarten year.
Schalke's Naldo "Grand Sport" is also successful on the bank.
For the third time in the start-up, Naldo is grateful to Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not sit for the third time in a row in the Schalker Startelf, but on the replacement bank, the understanding would have been great in many people if the nearly two meters large Brazilians had talked about the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered after the 1:0 win over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual in the middle circle and chief coach Domenico Tedesco thanked to all his professionals, the 36-year-old, whom all call Naldo for simpleness, told him, "We have to thank you, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction to his vice captain, who, despite his re-reservist existence, did not hear any angry.
Naldo, who was celebrated as the best Schalker last season, knows that he didn’t actually fall on his trainer’s trainer--but for good reasons he receives a break.
A reason called "load control".
It was not easy to tell him.
"It wasn't easy to tell him what I'm telling you honestly," Tedesco told the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the start-up.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it’s always about the thing, it’s about the association,” Tedesco founded the step.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can go through at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat,” Tedesco explained the rotation, which last caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by showing himself on the bank as an exemplary team player.
The mood in Austria’s industry continued to speed up its valley ride in August compared to the eurozone.
The shopping manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month depth.
Nevertheless, behind Ireland and the Netherlands, Austria has the third best mood across Europe, the Markit Institute announced on Monday on its survey among 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro zone’s PMI increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, but the index is the 13th month in a row below the trademark of 50 counters.
Only Ireland industry cracked this threshold with 50.9 points in August.
The Greeks were the final light (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer dropped slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index at 44.0 points reached the highest level since March.
"The slightly weakened valley ride could mean that the worst has survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, the industry remains, in the third quarter, growth brake number one.
A quick return to the growth zone is not in view: export orders in the eurozone have no longer fallen as strong as since November 2011.
Companies therefore set up jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China also declined more than initially.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts first expected 47.8 points.
The shopping manager index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, the developments in sales, employment, camps and prices are increased.
