The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the fast fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions of ČEZ shares reached approximately half of their value in a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of Tuesday, immediately reacted to the fall of Monday when it dropped to approximately 6%.
The decline this time is due to the fall of stocks on Wall Street.
Here also the market reaction is expressed to the result of the American Assembly of Representatives' vote that refused to support the stabilization plan of the Secretary of the Financial Sector.
Decline of stocks in Asia
Asian Stock Exchange stocks experienced a dramatic drop on Tuesday, although throughout the day the index finally mitigated some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index over its financial day marked nearly four percent, although later reduced its losses by reducing the decline in virtually 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that follows the movements of Chinese stocks in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange dropped by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai markets were closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange shares lost more than five percent, but in the end, the losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange according to the Secretary of the Index dropped to 3.6 percent.
“Rescue actions scheduled in the U.S. are insecure and this influences the financial market around the world,” said Chief of the Hong Kong Currency Office, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, that is, without reliance on China’s Central Bank.
Hong Kong interest rates are at the same level as those in the United States.
American legislators should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody bathroom of American stocks
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the financial system assistance plan to be devoted to $700 billion (almost 12 trillion crowns).
Legislators, in this way, ignored President George Bush’s invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, American stocks lived a bloody bath and mainly the share rate collected the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped to almost seven percent. A similar volume drop was last recorded in 1987.
The index dropped already before it was announced, but soon it was shown that the assembly’s proposal did not go ahead, the index began to fall freely.
Congress withdraws: U.S. government can inject $700 billion into the bank
The highest representatives of Congress and government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial assistance to the U.S. finance system.
Their vote will be held early next week.
U.S. legislators brought a gap in talks on the approval of the rescue plan in their form of help to the U.S. financial system with the amount of $700 billion (about 12 trillion of crowns).
However, it is not winning yet.
Congressmen must define some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and that it is voted.
The financial system assistance plan will be discussed at the Assembly of Representatives on Monday.
He said on Sunday to Reuters agency, Barney Frank, chairman of the Assembly’s Financial Services Committee and Banking.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be made in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, the “disambiguation” will be achieved thanks to the complex mechanisms whose market aid will also be achieved in practice.
Paulson: The Plan Should Be Effective
“We have made a great progress.
We resolve our discrepant views regarding how the package of measures for the stabilization of the market must have," Democratic Nancy Pelosia told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of legislators met Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a definitive shape to the Government Fund.
This should buy from financial companies unselling mortgage assets that lead financial companies to heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are about to close the plan agreement, which will work and must also be effective on the market.
It’s still necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we’re already in it,” Paulson said.
A signal for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis expressly affects the market of stocks that fall rapidly.
According to Democratic Senator for Nevada, Harry Reid, lawmakers are doing everything they can for Congress to definitively approve an agreement on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors’ businesses in front of the Asian finance market as these are those found in the first time pitch and where Congress could influence trade on Monday.
For now, however, there is nothing clear about when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote and, not even, if they will not stagnate at the last moment with any problem.
Legislators believe it will be approved in the coming days.
The law, however, will suffer a number of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system should be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion have to be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, which would be another $100 billion and later the last $350 billion.
Bush appreciated the progress of meetings
On the other hand, the president can veta this decision, but Congress can exceed his veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was retained to gain financial resources for repurchase of bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to finish paying their mortgage.
“We’ve worked everything.
The Assembly of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote for the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday,” said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with Saturday’s advance and values “the endeavour of both parties to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy.”
Limitation of the Armored Contract
The president of the Senate’s Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, head of negotiators, said legislators decided on the responsibility for the taxpayers’ tax protection of their losses, a relieving closing of the scheduled finance plan.
The new law should also limit so-called armored contracts for directors of the participating societies of the programme, and create a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This would have to be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked hard on this, and have made a great progress towards the agreement that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also helps homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree with the new mortgage payments it purchases in order to lower the monthly burdens of payments at the deadlines of the debtors and enable them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological aid
The proposed plan is, according to Chief Economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be achieved but rather difficult.
“And that’s why we don’t know what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government,” Marek said this week, for iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
“More importantly, this week, congressmen agree on their support and give them their good visa everything as soon as they can.
This important and psychological agreement that this approval will be reached is, at the moment, the most important thing,” Marek said.
Armed fight: the MP3 Player against your mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
What seems clear is that it is better to buy only the phone.
Still there are enough reasons for man to acquire only the reproductor.
The choice depends practically on how it is used and the demand of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for you to purchase the most modern toys to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
On the other hand, these types of musical products such as LP discs no longer come out, and in terms of their quality there is neither a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If the vinyl records with art rock music, jazz or blues are taken up on your shelves, you’re probably dreaming at least about this type of plays.
This is the same with the music that is on the way, i.e., compressed, simplified music - MP3 music.
And here are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, the same as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the market helmets from twenty crowns.
Two extremes, among which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
Also decides the battery life
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even what not even most mobiles.
No current apparatus is as universal as the phone.
In front of the most elementary functions such as calling, sending messages, playing music and video, recording both, having a better or worse photography apparatus and even can browse.
And when we take into account the smartphone and the PDAs will also have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a small miracle as no refrigerator can make a grilled and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobiles also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on the mobile before the screen indicator will be illuminated by requesting to be recharged.
And playback of music is one of the biggest energy tragons.
Few are the mobiles that play music more than ten or twelve hours, most of them much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest) clearly have greater performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobiles will not play more than two hours.
If in addition to this above, they constantly call themselves even, for more safety, a charger for work - this is also valid for the most expensive devices.
With the MP3 player this problem won’t have, as even the worst stand at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens when recording music on your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a portion of the devices has the universal USB connector and, in addition, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only on some unreduced reader units can the small memory cards that are used on mobiles are connected.
In players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Just fill the apparatus with music through the computer USB.
Most mobile phones and players create their order in the music library alone according to the interpreter’s name, album title, genre, or also according to user rating.
Some devices only show a tree structure directory similar to a Windows Searcher and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific equipment interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to the music as a background and you will listen to it every day just a while, as in the tram, then enough for you with any mobile you play.
What gets virtually any mobile.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or player plays music.
The MP3 plays it all, and virtually all the music that comes to you will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and except the absolute majority of apparatus play music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by Apple company and its iPod).
The best mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy online music.
Simply through the mobile’s internet visit the operator’s competent pages (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could be on its own a weight argument for purchasing a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and most is limited only to the fleeing success issues of radios.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, in general, it is assumed that precisely this way of sale of music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always have a cell phone on top.
Whenever you want to hear something, you will find the mobile in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile even though it is at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobiles with music will be their price.
The cheapest costs usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will limit the absence of a classic headphone input.
The best, even with regard to the technical part, such as phones equipped with an input of 3.5 mm. for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - in no way necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - really handles them anyone.
The minimum functions, their handling similar to the previous current casets or also to the touchboards are obvious.
It does not pose a threat in the sense that we mistakenly connect to the Internet with the mobile and, consequently, gigantic counts by data drop.
Which apparatus to decide
Even cheaper mobiles (e.g., Vodafone 527) generally have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a proper card, it will reach the two thousand crowns.
Be careful, however.
The basic models are usually equipped with only a 2GB card of maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
According to the capacity (a maximum of 2 GB) there is no need to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are considered among the most demanding music lovers, hand the most specialized mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles on the walkman line have almost the same use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same price category, over the four thousand crowns, but with greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator capacity (usually 15 hours, with maximum performance up to 35 hours), the brand cited most arries brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator is going to arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western Europe partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It's probably not too long to arrive.
That Czech operators are part of the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it on mobile.cz.
The rest also confirmed this by the Czech Telecommunications Office (Czech Telecommunications Office) which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is the most expensive in the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming fees regulation it will likely reach a paradox situation - for some Czech mobile operator customers the SMS that they send from abroad will be cheaper than if they send them from home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical, as we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to regret that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (Czech Telecommunications Office), Pavel Dvořák, said that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operators.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with their own network no longer has too much possibilities (for the rest, it would be difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still one possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought an outstanding decline in prices to which classic operators should also react.
At the same time, even before sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entering the UK market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It was shown that there is place for these types of operators and that they can succeed.
In other words, we don’t need to look for examples too far.
In February this year we inform you about the launch of the virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
Only after half a year, this operator managed to obtain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking is the Penta group, which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on many more specific target groups.
Furthermore, in order to work effectively, many fewer customers are enough than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively large expenses in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world, these types of virtual operators are usually profiled with low expenses - offer cheap SMS calls and messages that nevertheless often counteract with the more adjusted service offer.
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in Britain offers SMS at least half cheap in terms of competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good hit the bet for a no-trivial target group.
This operator is directed specifically to the man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - it's the operator who likes and who can be trusted," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works on this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether similar concept as Poland could engage in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický said: “The Czech market is relatively small for access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
Furthermore, from the point of view of the service offering is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost sure that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic that will not be Mobilking.
“We’re talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech R. doesn’t seem too hopeful.
Rather, it’s about the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region,” said Jana Studničková, spokesman for the Penta Financial Group in a telephone conversation for mobile.cz.
Indirectly he assured that current mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything they can so that no potential competition arises.
Interest on the launch of a virtual mobile operator already shows it the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step later to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
“We have a great interest in this, to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telephone services but also mobile telephone services.
And how much earlier, better.
With this possibility, we have repeatedly met with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have managed to move forward at the meetings,” group spokesman Pavel Kaidl said.
So, perhaps better times.
It seems that, for non-official information, the first official operator would possibly have to arrive at the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
“At this moment we believe the situation is suitable for the appearance of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
To date, no one has addressed us with some complex and serious project in this field,” said Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesman for Telefónica O2.
The specificity of the Czech market refers to other operators.
T-mobile spokesman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional conformity with O2's opinion, added: "Until today we have not registered any viable commercial projects that, bilaterally profitable, can continue to develop."
And he adds, “In the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find some virtual operators until the end of the year.
At this point, we should already have a specific contract on the table that would be possible to study at such a short horizon."
Vodafone directs your attention rather to the compliance of the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický adds: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this regarding the distribution of spending and infrastructure.
We consider it as the biggest contribution from the customers’ perspective.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this field is in the partner with whom setting up a shared network for a fast internet on the mobile.”
Responsible offices - with operators nail and meat
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition, leading to a decline in prices and thus to a decline in profits.
So why make it easier to enter the competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull out of the same rope, proof of it is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the biggest pressure to ČTU was at the time of U:fon entry for T-Mobile society.
This is a testimony of public information accessible on the CTU websites.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds to this: “In addition, not long ago the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was open to a fourth operator.
With regard to the character of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player to the market would suppose to him and, above all, to his services.
That is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
It is not only about the position of the ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (ÚOHS).
However, this expressed its typical position towards this problem.
“The entry of a virtual operator to the mobile market would be possible after a convention was closed on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator.
No agreement has been closed until today since the offer of the potential interested rather was not interesting enough for classic operators,” added Kristian Chalupa of the U.O.H.S. Foreign Relations Department.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For the offices that should represent consumer interests is more than consideration, besides it, no one should take advantage of their position in the market.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa added: “Abroad where virtual operators normally work, we can observe that their entry into the market contributed to the low prices of mobile phone services.”
Obviously, the pressure regarding the proper functioning of the market media and the price drop does not fall within the interest of the UOHS.
Really the dramatically shocking in this entire case is in the dissonant reactions resulting from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a chance, it is offered by itself.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline in petrol stations because it is clear that it is work of chance and a hard struggle for competition.
"The Office in this regard has not found signs of unfair competition and has therefore no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position therefore do not have a corresponding rise in responsibility in their market actions.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators, rather, are missing, as well as telecom regulators,” Chalupa said.
Interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many conflicting points.
Obviously, there is an analysis of relevant markets prepared by the CTU that telecommunications are from the point of view of the commercial bidding a single market.
In this type of market naturally none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to emerge it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile phone operator - with all his logic - has the monopoly of his network.
Therefore, in a specific segment, it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for UOHS should represent a warning that three mobile operators rise flawlessly similarly.
The current complaints of stakeholders (including the GTS Novera society) show that in all negotiations with the operators, there are many similar obstacles.
Loading responsibility in the CTU is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications of which the UOHS washs hands in this entire matter.
We have met him already in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, recently, a new amendment to the telecommunications law was submitted for the expansion of the competition of ČTU in the field of commercial bidding that was not carried out, even when a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This must be known perfectly by the representatives of UOHS, but it is obvious that their interests are found elsewhere.
Everything's okay when no one looks
At the same time, something unnoticedly continues to work like a pseudovirtual operator that there are already a few in the Czech mobile networks.
They are companies that put their own prices on mobile phone services which, however, only a portion are public.
It is usually about companies that are dedicated to multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a few selected people get the price list of these companies.
The magic is where the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the company ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer, you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that trade conditions in all Czech mobile operators forbid that type of reselling.
"If cases such as those mentioned were discovered, we could talk about infringement under contract conditions that could be translated to the end of collaboration with the given society," Martina Kemrová said.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity performed by mobile phone operators would not reach responsible people.
In the case of the three cited companies, thousands of customers can be reached.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies, they obtain no negligible profits and, at the same time - unlike real virtual traders - they noway threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of the possible problems: "The law allows speculation of this type, however, the services of this company are used only by a desirable so much percent of customers.
They must also agree that your phone’s SIM card is not on your name so they cannot absolutely have it as a normal customer of the operators.”
This is exactly what should look like the minimally strange.
There is also a new question for the UOHS.
If mobile phone operators turn their eyes into this type of procedure, why do they block the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the UOHS has enough competence to discover this type of activities and if it is not going to want to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this story and that its business conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive
As was already clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant decline in service prices.
At the same time, virtually in all countries where the virtual operator emerged, classic operators attempted more or less to protect themselves from this irruption.
The arguments used by these were almost all identical - too small, a market, eventually, too saturated, problems with the quality of the service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, regulatory bodies have intervened at this time and in no case defended operators but their customers.
Whether with formal measures or informal pressure, they managed to emerge the first virtual operator and others began to emerge with him.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body all this case happens as if it was a burning nail.
By our experience we cannot cease to impress us that the confusion of attributes in these cases suit you.
But let's not despair.
If this information between frames is correct and the virtual operator really arrives in these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market probably begins to move again.
If any of the operators enter virtual mobile phone operators, it will be difficult for the UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the official Czech anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek on the day of official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, my home.
The new anthem recorded it from the National Theatre orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solo, one to male voice and another to female voice, another with Coro and another instrumental.
The song is commissioned by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to the four versions.
Bělohlávek considers this national Czech song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio has already said before that it intentionally chosen for singers alone with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning, I have tried with both and then, also, with the Choir that were fixed in the diction so that the text was well understood, so that it was consistent," he said.
The Czech official anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, my Home sounded for the first time in 1834 on the tables of the State Theatre in the original Czech work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with the music of František Škroup.
He gained popularity and people made it his own.
The first strophe of the song after the Czechoslovakian emergence in 1918 became naturally part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
Prague MHD takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, it is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company the date when the first passengers enter the subway, tram and bus with an electronic bonus in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can now be purchased by almost one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual bonus (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously load it on their chip card at the info centers and posts of the transportation company at the stations of Metro, Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Kolýl, Andšlyl, Roztyl
Bonuses can be purchased on the internet from yesterday on the transportation company’s pages, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than 400 people.
Those who begin to use the internet as a form of trading may definitely begin to forget the ticket sales positions at the subway stations, where they so far had to regularly tail to get a normal ticket out.
The bonus is purchased on the internet, and the Opencard card will recharge it at one of the 13 subsidiaries of the Municipal Library.
“In these places there is available to passengers a window with prepared staff that helps stakeholders with purchasing online and also with the recharge of the bonus purchased on their card,” said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic bonus on the Opencard on the automatic sales machines located in some lobsters of the subway.
How are these sales machines?
They are red, they remind us of a ticket picking machine and travellers probably have already been fixed on them at the stations of Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
“There are now five in the city but by the end of the year it would have to be eighty,” Opatrný said.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will begin to work tomorrow, is simple.
Just enter in it the Opencard chip card and the previously paid bonus will be loaded only on it.
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in circumvalation trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 that mainly use the inhabitants of the localities of Central Bohemia.
“In the trains enrolled on integrated transport from Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reader card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the bonus zone,” Filip Drapal of the Ropid organization sets the timetables for collective transport from Prague.
Circular buses have their reading cards mounted on the driver’s box.
When you enter, you need not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany it with the Opencard at the place intended for this on the side of the Box.
As a result, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
“If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the obligations there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information,” Dr. Drapal said.
Passengers who do not travel in surrounding buses and do not remember when the validity of the bonus is finished may be directed to the sales machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown information about the validity of your document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the U.S. in a referendum
The German Sudetes asked in 1945 to be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Southern Bohemia Scientific Library.
If we cannot be a part of Germany or Austria, we at least want to live under the employership of the United States of America.
With this desire they presumably addressed some groups of Sudetes Germans to the president of the US in 1945.
It is from the letters that are stored in a particular file and that are today stored in the collection of the Southern Bohemia Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov asked in a letter to the U.S. president not to allow the return of the "Sumava land" - occupied by Hitler based on the Munich Covenant - again to Czechoslovakia.
“We have correctly understood the situation and really want his word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators,” he writes in the letter, signed with a “people who carry the fate of Šumava in their heart.”
Given that the union of Czechoslovakia with the Southeast Germans presumably presupposes - according to these the national Czech character - a hope only in brutality, contemplation, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors beg the letter to the American president who takes Šumava for today and forever under a protectorate.
“We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants gives us to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that at all collaborates with the victory of allies.”
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president presumably doubted about this idea of the Germans šumavos, it would suffice to organize a referendum in the šumavos lands about whether its inhabitants want to be part of the U.S. or live under their patronship.
Despite the fact that the text of the letter, with the current knowledge we have of post-war history, may sound a little childhood to us, according to some specialists thoroughly painting the expectations of the Southeast Germans of then.
Although the Czech Germans had to mind that it was to be dealt with about their expulsion from the republic only a few admitted this possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate for the Sudetes some clear form of autonomy.
Others believed they will stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed even by Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was in the war, as the German of Budějovice, wrapped in the Baltic Marine.
When the British arrested him at the end of the war and placed him in the Holstein prisoner camp, dozens of Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, the Czech would be good for them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, counted that on the basis of the Decrees of Benes would be away from the Republic.
You don't think - pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could characterize the emotional campaign that the Ministry of Transport decided to launch on Wednesday.
The minister’s office, Aleš Řebíček, promises that it will dissuade drivers of dangerous behavior on the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will be felt on television, radio, cinema, internet and brochures.
It would have to dissuade the driver from high speed and alcohol at the wheel.
And also to remind them that before starting, the belts are attached.
He wants to reach awareness above all of young drivers, drivers, pedestrians and ultimately also of professional drivers.
What can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories that embrace emotions.
And for this, the "sanguinary" ads are testifyed throughout the entire campaign:
You don't think - pay!
The word "You don't think" is written with large letters in the enrollment.
And in a blood shell is the word "payments."
This must symbolize that a man at a time of waste can get to pay with his own life.
The ads are going to "meet fear" of the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of victims of accidents can be seen.
Promised that this will reduce accidents and the number of dead on the Czech roads.
The announcements were drawn up by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and lattice for drivers
"For drivers the sugar and lattice system is worthwhile.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a semaphor is spent in red and thus saves time.
The latigue is a threat of fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks,” says transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital Martin Kořán.
And that’s why an informative campaign in the press is needed and mainly negative advertising, specifically the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
“If there is a panel installed warning of some danger, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay you more attention,” Korán warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The president of the provisional government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, pronounced the restitution of almost all lands occupied in 1967, i.e. the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Highs, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper.
“We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we must necessarily restitute almost all (occupied) lands if it is not all,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“I’m sure we’re going to stay with some percent of these lands, but we’ll have to give the Palestinians a similar percent (of the lands of Israel) because without this there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that in case of restitution this Jerusalem would also be included.
“Whoever wants safety in Jerusalem and therefore doesn’t want tractors or excavators to pass above his legs as it went to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem,” Olmert said in reference to the two July attacks in the city where there were several dead and dozens of people were injured.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find “a special solution for the Temple Hill, a sacred and historic place” that is located inside the ancient city.
Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he insisted later.
Removal of the Golan Highs
Olmert was also pronounced for the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Highs which from his point of view is an inherent condition to close a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also involve concrete efforts by Damascus.
"I do not propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of the Golan withdrawal," he said.
“The Syrians know what they will have to take off to win the Golan.
They must abandon their current relationships with Iran, they must abandon their relationships with Hizbullah (Chita movement), they must be deprived of the permanent support caused by Hamas (Chita movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq.
Questions after the accident: Are bushes illegal?
The law is unknown, you cannot walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near the Italian city of Padova, we have a question of whether traffickers and passengers can move by the bus during the journey.
“If we wish to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the officer is opposed to road transit law,” said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the twenty-twenty-year-old died last week was obviously caused by the truck driver only that the bus crossed on the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the least safe place of the vehicle despite having booked two other sites.
However, the bus may suddenly have an accident or brake, and at the precise time when the coffee or newspapers are distributed.
Here the role plays is if the bus is equipped, according to technical permission, with walking places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must go sitting.
Long-distance buses from Student Agency do not have places to stand, which the company’s director, Radim Jančura, confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
“We have solved this with the ministry and in principle passenger movement is not allowed.
“This finally withdrew it and we arrived at the agreement that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat,” he told us.
The sheriff doesn’t know the law.
“There is no evident legal interpretation of the role of the officer – no legal provision clarifies this function.
Even no legal provision prohibits transport agents to perform any service.
The road transport law only knows the term "Vehicle Reviewer", whose rights and obligations are not defined," said Hanzelka.
The Director of the Ministry of Transportation’s Road Vehicle Traffic Department, Josef Pokorný, thinks on the contrary that the law sufficiently fulfils this problem.
“It depends on whether the bus has the approval permitted to have sites on foot.
That’s all,” he says.
Buses are divided between urbans, where there are places to stand and at limited maximum speed, interurban sites to stand with higher speed permit and long distances without foot, with higher speed permit and seats equipped with safety belt.
As in the plane, the expert says
BESIP Expert in Transport Safety, Jaroslav Hořín, sees no major problems with the movement of the sachet in the bus.
“During the development of the trip there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared to aircraft service.
It is not even here that the turbulences will come and the shelter can be hit in the head.”
“However, if the bus suddenly brakes obviously that physical laws are valid.
The same as on an urban bus or on the tram.
The safety of the carrier must resolve it by the carrier’s rules of procedure,” he says and also believes that from the point of view of law this problem is unsolved.
Jančura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the housekeeper service.
Employ in it to two hundred.
The director, neither after the accident, considers that work risky.
“However, at the time you have the impression that the stewardship position is risky, then I will suppress it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, when entering.
It would even save costs,” he says.
In safety interest, Asiana is why she lacks shelters in her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
“We don’t have households, we’re against them from the beginning.
Before or later this will end in a deadly accident," he said less than a year ago to Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy happened.
In the line accident that joined Naples, a young Pilsen shelter died who had worked for the company two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably rotated from the parking rail by blocking the passage to the bus without using the intermittents.
His driver tried a quick maneuver to avoid it, however, hit the front right.
Jančura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the rest of the shelter were sold.
"These sites are not possible to book them for long distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait on the judgment judgment on compensation for the girl’s family, but expects the financial expenses also from the guilty.
Reform of the law?
No, for now.
The reform of the law could bring greater accuracy about the housekeeper’s movement in the bus in which for a year thirty experts have been working in a group of members of the Ministry of Transport.
“However, they have not reached any concrete conclusion.
They are not devoted too much to buses, but rather to the point system, maximum highway speed and mobile use during the drive,” says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the shelters something that threatens the safety of passengers significantly," spokesman Hanzelka concluded that safety control in buses is the competence of the police and the Office of Safety at work.
Dusseldorf’s hope is based in Frankfurt
In the letter of the West LB Bank Board for its employees there are no great words.
By merging the Düsseldorf bank units with the DEKA bank can be formed `a central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group', as written, published Monday
The West LB bank, breaking the ‘competition block’ with sustainable profitability would enter such a business.
Furthermore, such merger can be a beginning for subsequent mergers in the area of regional banks.
Thus the text comes to be understood, when a board of directors wants to show ability to act in hard times.
Because as before the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only is the part of the European Union, but also the federal institute for the surveillance of financial services that recently made the North Rhine-Westphalia government clear that little time is left to find a solution.
For a while, also from Frankfurt, we have talked a lot about the binding of such a kind between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know for their investment funds, and the West LB.
In truth, Franz Waas, the head of DEKA bank, presented the data after a half-year to the end of August let him know that he sees no sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Street, with a regional bank such as the Helaba or the West LB.
But the DEKA Board of Directors, which is now made up of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, commissioned the Board of Directors to start negotiations with the West LB on common business activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or some parts of it.
Of course, negotiations have just started, so it is said on the financial site.
It’s not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the field of Sparkassen the name of the DEKA bank appears that with its 3000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003 at a time the situation seemed like the DEKA bank could merge with the Rhine-Palatinate regional bank and with the Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union has left no results.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hesse government expressed itself against the Helaba’s participation in this project.
The other two banks did not find the same language either.
Instead, the Rhine-Palatinate regional bank began the dialogue with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But finally, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Helaba Board, said he was against the plans of coexistence with his bank.
Independent of that it seems to be clearer that the union of the different banks in the area of public law is necessary.
Well, when the elections of the Bavaria parliament will be passed, the BayernLB’s union with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
For the Helaba that is not necessarily a good news.
If the pressure continues to merge will increase, Helaba will miss partners to do that.
In the south the bank might be just a young partner, although so far it was much better outstanding from the financial crisis that the properties in Stuttgart and Munich did.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85% of the Helaba, earlier this year avoided plans for coexistence with the West LB.
In any case, the Nord LB is left alone.
But such geostrategic reflections are just a part.
It is also about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June, Merl asked a fundamental question about a commercial model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband so far gave no answer.
In the end, the West LB can be broken down, but that, of course, is not the desire of the bank itself.
Thus, also in the letter of the bank’s board is said that it would be attempted to find a complete solution for the entire bank.
As the coexistence between singular parts of the bank and DEKA can be combined, that’s going to show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the Italian weekend"
For Elena is the first time, for Luca is the third or fourth.
But this time, he assists Elena as his girlfriend, and that’s why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-liter Kaiser branded beer barrel is built a huge bear tiger that shows nearly 200 Oktoberfest participants that low sounds know how to produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a palm, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from parking next to Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 23:45 three buses leave, ` direction Munich, the beer party', predicted arrival at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are planned above all for Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking next to their flag, the South Americans are singing, they had already started to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for the Italians.
At Marco, which wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver sticks, these buses belong to him.
For five years they have come to the Oktoberfest, taking into account that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the road there, during the day in the grassland, at 22:30 the turn.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome receipt with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the Bavarian purity law, disease insurance and the German guide- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the direction "Brennero"
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly the tranquility reigns in the bus, travellers are sleeping.
It's all right, they'll still need the forces.
It is going to Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian registration make another break on the 8th highway shortly before Munich.
Finally, when the Marco group has the expected arrival at 6.30 in the morning at the parking next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put a yellow cake.
There, on the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to the gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "connocersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the tent of the campaign are opened, that means marking!", Marco screamed in the morning.
"March!" Walk and occupy the back sites in the campaign tent.
"Don't take the places ahead, because we're going to block, and all with yellow caps don't sit on the same bench, spread throughout space!"
One liter of beer, Marco rug, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the propine
Show safety people that we have a good tone!
Only leaving his place, he will be busy!"
Third: "This late exactly at ten and a half you have to come here!"
And now everyone goes to the Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the path, ties the yellow caps on the trees, traffic signals and even on a poster of the elections of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
We want to be able to recognize the path back.
It's the second weekend of Oktoberfest known as "the Italian weekend"
There is no accurate data about the number of people; it is about 50,000 people traveling over the Alps and stormfully entering the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend in Italy.
Munich police receive help from seven police officers from the autonomous province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross making a statistic of the present nations, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 assistance) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The favorite tent of the Italian campaign is called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
Germany’s banking system is relatively stable, he stressed only last week Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück.
Well, that the politician would use the word "relatively" and added that the German banking area will also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich’s real estate financial, listed in the DAX index, receives from a consortium of German banks a billion credit to be able to resistance to turbulence on the market.
A person who knows the situation very well told Reuters on Monday: credit aid amounted to 35 billion euros.
The portion of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate will use has to cast interest.
The money comes from private banks as well as from those of public law.
The cause of this is the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to a report, state financials with the money that was borrowed for long-term projects funded them only a short period—which now, due to market distrust, is no longer possible.
In the first half of the year, the cash bank’s capital reserve has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the share of its own capital delayed a little from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, continuous financial investment revenues and net profits from financial transactions fell to zero, debtors’ imputation revenues and some securities also those of credit business provision dissolving tended to drop by more than 70 percent, by 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and many revenues of the compensation expenses for the restructuring of the former Defa group, as well as the refund of interest under the federal tax code and organized businesses for the consortium companies, the negative balance could charge a deficit with approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financial initially lost in speculation with industrial credits for real estate, which served as a reason for the founding of the Aareal bank.
Since much money could not be earned from the financing of state projects, the Defa began to intensively dedicate to projects in the area of infrastructure and community project funding by private and state investors (PPP-Private-Public-Partnership) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to carry out amortizations on the subsidiary value that will have a "essential material effect" on the group's consolidated account of losses and profits, it is said very inaccurately.
It is a fact that dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007 they were canceled to two-thirds.
After the acquisition of the Depfa, the Hypo Real Estate became a major state and financial financial in the field of infrastructure.
Since the bank does not possess customer deposits, it turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbanking market compared to other banks.
With the bankruptcy of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank credits dropped essentially because banks were saving their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs nearly €50 billion each year to fund a portion of Defa credit portfolios from its short-term measures for refinancing.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with a credit the need for the group’s funding for a short time and the company is assured of “the influence of international monetary markets that are now essentially unable to work.”
Other sources say that thanks to this money refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need monetary markets for the predictable time.
The German Central Bank and the Federal Financial Services Surveillance Institute (BaFin) depart from the basis that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group from now on is secured.
That’s what the bank’s shareholders and creditors have to wait for.
But because of the dynamics and the imponderability of the crisis there is no evidence.
It is even imaginable that you don’t need funding in your full volume.
But the opposite case cannot be excluded.
It was the voice that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvent, so temporary salvation cannot reassure at least worried people.
The share price dropped to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Loan courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While priority debts almost do not change, loan courses depending on the position in the property registration clearly tend to lower.
In particular, the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are affected and the loans whose duration exceeds 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While emitting banks, governments and banks that are little affected are still ready to support the system, while it can be started from pension amortization within time.
Or something will happen, which no one risks to imagine - the financial crisis will overcome in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-news about partial statization, now the security that is already within its limit has become a justified hope.
That’s going to be a reason, because creditors will spend the nights without sleeping, breaking their head over the decision about their isolation of enthusiasm.
Short-term investors can still put the endpoint and use the new account of the losses for upcoming benefit compensation tax payments on change in the future.
Sylvana and the Secrets of Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at Tachibana High School, the girls began to laugh: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on the exchanges she tells Japan.
“The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before going to school, I was afraid.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the Kawasaki direction and I go by train 40 minutes to Highschool Tachibana.
Sola had to find the way, luckily I didn't miss.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not as strictly fixed as in my house, in Lower Saxony.
From eight o'clock in the morning students come, at nine o'clock at least twenty starts a small meeting with the teachers, the home room.
Before the class started, I had touched to present me.
Besides, I’m not a person who speaks with pleasure in the public, especially in a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform, I put an old skirt from my host family's mother and also a bluse, blue socks and black skin shoes.
Well, so dressed I put myself to the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - I'm called Sylvana, I'm from Germany and in a week will be my birthday.
At this moment I was very happy because I had started studying this language for two years.
All 31 girls in the class have cuchiched, laughed and made signs and all the time I have heard the word "kawaii"
I knew her of my sleeves.
That belongs to the vocabulary of Japanese girls' survival and means "moon, beautiful"
Then I quickly slipped to my site.
The girl next to it had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I really felt assaulted.
Everyone spoke at the same time, laughed and asked many questions – at the same time it is very difficult to understand English from Japanese.
Then in the recreation, everyone took their blessings out.
My host family's mother also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something else than boring pieces of German bread.
He had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and something like meat in mass tofu.
In most cases, I don’t know what it’s like here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new flavor.
What is sure is that everything is very rich.
Well, perhaps with the exception of marinated springs in the salt, buff!
In Japanese schools Bentos are not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a beautifully done in a very artistic mode for a boy and gives him in hope to get to know him better during a recreation.
I read about it in my Manga Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see it here too.
"Why exactly Japan?", my friends asked when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school one year.
Then he always answered:
"Well, because I'm fascinating."
For many years, I’ve preferred to read Sleeve.
To better understand comics and culture, one day I started studying a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely sure that one day I’m going to travel there.
Also because I have a little bit by tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is a severe, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I haven’t yet felt lost here though Tokyo is the largest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Rats also have feelings.
It is said that a rat or a cocktail feeling the danger runs away, why is it also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can you control if they, behaving in the same way as us, feel the same?
In an internet magazine called "Edge" for many years, the contributions of famous scientists are published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think what is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or someone else could prove it until now, although we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we devote ourselves to other species and include the questions about the sensation and in general about consciousness, we enter the unknown area because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as the other animals: it makes the dead, flees, or attacks.
People behave in a similar manner of what some scientists make conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course, I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to contaminate our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with the human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the brain cortex (because of their participation in short memory and executive functions that lead conduct).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of people than that of the other primates and seems to be absolutely missing in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects referred to our consciousness that depends on the prefrontal lobe of the brain cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from the other primates.
Another particularity is found in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is connected with the tongue, that often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even if consciousness would not depend on the language, it would influence the consciousness of animals, created as any, in many cases would differ from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as an interesting and subjective thing, is not allowed to measure because it has the special hardware, nor is it allowed to analyze it through our experiences, so its research presents big problems to us.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of the conscious experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
Animal awareness processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that’s what happens during primate short memory studies, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick the essential goes rather to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two can be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the brain cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what does that result for feelings?
I owe the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for that, as happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when brain activity occupies a space of the defence system (or its consequences such as body reactions).
In view of this point of view, the feelings are very attached to a part of the brain cortex which distinguishes primates and, above all, man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature follow classifications of fine sensations because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar in order to be able to describe the states of others to ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damascus, on the contrary, thinks that feelings are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the brain cortex responsible for the bodily feelings and the headache trunk, the same Jaak Pankseep thinks, but focuses more on the headache trunk.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can absolutely refer to different types and their feelings.
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as afraid, possibly that feels like this in two cases too: But how can you control whether rats and men behave likewise feel the same?
Seeing the danger a cocktail runs away, can you be afraid?
I am of the opinion that the likeness of behaviour still doesn’t prove the likeness of experience.
This is true that neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have similar headache trunks, cockroaches on the contrary do not have at least one brain.
Is the trunk of the head head that is responsible for feelings?
Even when it is possible to test it for men: How can you test it in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also the cocktails (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I rather investigate emotional behavior of rats rather than emotional feelings because their feelings supposedly differ fundamentally from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and tongue).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here as well as rats and men are measured.
Because I don’t investigate the language and consciousness of rats, as well as feelings, I don’t know if they exist.
It can be said that I don’t see beyond my noses, but I prefer to move forward than working permanently without results.
Well, I'm practical emotionalist.
UEFA Chairman Platini: Grace Deadline for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the supplementary Prime Minister, said the preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
“The government looks at UEFA’s decision in Bordeaux as the trust proof of Ukraine’s capacity to organize the European championship along with Poland,” Wasjunik said.
“But that’s not an amnesty for our country.
Now the job is about to start and in the two countries there is a lot to do.”
The hours of construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in host countries are cozy.
The number of stadiums will possibly be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste more time.
Now we have to do high-speed jobs,” said the president of an Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
“The UEFA will not remove the eyes of us.”
In Poland, a more radical step was agreed.
Following numerous scandals, the Olympic Committee of Poland suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
“There is a serious danger that the PZPN is unable to follow the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
“In a letter we assured the president of UEFA Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that.”
Only in the last season many first division clubs were convicted of declining manipulation to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be delayed.
Contra-attack by Dennis Quaid
She wanted to promote a new movie, spoke in an interview on private life--and has problems with her former husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her former husband as an adulter.
He's angry and counter-attacked.
The late war of the two roses in the former spouse of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan, he first spoke about the reasons for marriage failure: "Dennis was a long time infidel to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of a marriage failure is told.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to the designation of him as an infidel husband was clear: “This is unheard of how many times Meg tells the story of our relationship in another version,” the 54-year-old man told New York Daily News.
Among other things, it is very "lamentable" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, "goes again to remember in public the pain and changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan after a divorce lives alone, Quaid is again married and recently he is twin daddy.
And thus ends his statements highlighting: "Let my life be as it is continues.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that's okay."
Prices of plane and hotel tickets are dropping
In the first half of the year 2008 plane tickets and nightlife in Europe were cheaper compared to last year’s tickets.
According to a current study, plane tickets in Germany were cheap even up to 50%.
Plane tickets and nightlife in hotels became cheap again - this is the results of a study from American Express’s travel and financial service provider.
The company has analyzed its booking data from the first half of the year 2008 and after the price rise in the first quarter found a major change in the second half.
After the prices on the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnights in many sites became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe rose on average to 6.9 percent.
From April to June prices already dropped to 3.6% compared last year.
The trends were more perceptible in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for this was the weakening dollar course, which was the cause of "the interests of American tourists on traveling decreased."
The decline in hotel prices is also noted much more at financial centers such as Frankfurt or London than at industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent and thus beat a record in Europe.
In the first quarter plane ticket prices also showed rise trends:
Due to the rise in kerosene prices Economy class travelers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long distance flights even became more expensive to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the prices of plane tickets in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, dropped on average to 12.5 percent, but price changes for the Business class and First class were small.
In Germany, price change was more notable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices rose to 11.9, in the second half down to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even dropped to half.
The cause of price change is from one part the rise in the slow economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the travel market with the plane, demand is decreasing.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes aircraft trafficking between the US and Europe.
The signal of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit flights in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines who declared bankrupt in the first half of 2008 - alone in Europe were 24 airlines.
The HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes the leader.
Luhukay of Borussia to him does not yet go to make the first tenth goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented the forcing landing of the national selection player Marko Martin.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed making a goal.
Everything I meant exactly reacting to what happened, I could read it clearly from his lips.
I just knew I was right.
"We need a second goal," silbated Hermann Rieger at the Hamburg Stadium cabin entrance.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time ended and most of the present were on their sites again.
Rieger was almost for three decades HSV physiotherapist, enjoying very high reputation as one of those who were part of the group.
That’s why his request was noted by a responsible person.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol ascend with his head and raised his fingers as a sign of settlement.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the main coach of Hamburg.
His order was the same: Way, the second goal!
But that was not done.
“Not everything was nice to see today,” Marcell Jansen added.
Also Bastian Reinhard had wanted to have it "more relaxed."
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) for his head impact; and also the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
“That was a dirty victory,” Martin Jol said.
On Monday, Hamburg’s SV will be 121 years old.
On Saturday, the viewers had already celebrated their own, the blue sky over the stadium and the table change on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it," said Marcell Jansen.
It predicts that the partial ratings in the table correspond more to the league's veility than to the dominance of your HSV.
The chipo with his forced players late like the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen who was taken from FC Bayern needs time to join, but still the chipo cannot shine with his successes.
“We need more feeling and dribbling,” Jol claims.
After the defeat of vote
Fear spreads on Wall Street.
The first news about the failure of the bank’s salvation package left Down Jones down to 700 points a certain period.
That was the loss of the biggest points for a day in his story.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little bit.
About 20:30 a.m. one of the world’s most important bag barometers scored a 5% deficit in 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and remained at 1548 points.
At this time, the largest loser in the Dow Jones was American Express who lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could gain value.
Goldmann Sachs’ stocks lost almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago, a big investor Warren Buffett had financially participated in the company.
The salvation plan plans to make resources available to buy so-called “podrides” mortgage shares.
But the sum will be paid by blow but step by step.
As a compensation for that, the state has to receive the share option receipts for financial associations that during the course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state’s cash.
Action courses in Europe and the US continue to drop
One billion aid for banks in Europe and the US does not reassure investors.
The course of stocks of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate low and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the salvation of the financial market projected by the state, the U.S. Dow Jones index continues to fall.
The losses of the speculated stocks of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the fall in the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite the rescue shares of the federal government and private banks, Munich’s real estate financial action a period of time lost two thirds of its value, the Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly fell under the psychological limit of 6,000 points and scored a 3.7% deficit in 5,839 units.
Throughout the world, financial markets have suffered a fall.
The opening of the Wall Street Day in New York began with notable losses.
Investors fear that the US government’s $700 billion salvation package is not enough to give financial markets impulses.
At the first hour after the opening the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent until it was 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the salvation project, the senate vote may be the first of October.
Also the other European balls knew only one trend: at first the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the main Japanese index Nikkei after profits fell to 1.26 percent by 11,743.61 units.

In addition, the commercial and tourist consortium announced that shares in the company Thoms Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the path of space probes
For many years a mysterious phenomenon causes dissatisfaction to researchers: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to manoeuvre.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s Relativity Theory cannot be so correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because fuel pipes are now healing threatens a cold death.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, anomaly during gravitational assistance to manoeuvre, causes dissatisfaction among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a manoeuvre of the path of space probes during which they obtain acceleration using the energy of a planet’s gravitational field, for example Earth.
This allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as did the Ulysses Sun probe.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave 100% as expected according to the venerable law of gravitation.
They rather frequent speed irregularities.
Improvised probes have greater or lower speed.
Physicists could not explain this effect so far.
It was called anomaly during gravitational assistance to manoeuvre.
Experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein’s general theory of Relativity that describes the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space cannot be as correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, solemnly believes now as before that Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what astronomers remained in the universe.
“The reason for anomaly may be Dark Matter that may also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Researchers in the universe know the existence of Dark Matter for only ten years.
It supposedly owns the strength of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
The Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible, meaning it does not send and reflect no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, Dark Matter makes at least a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Kidnapped tourists in Egypt are free
As the Italian foreign minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, kidnapped tourists in Egypt must be released.
Sudan’s kidnappers had required millions of rescue.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on rescue have already begun.
The Germans always fall back to the kidnapper’s attention point.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper tells about the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are freed.
About that the same information presents the Egyptian state television, the Arab television broadcast Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After the news about release at the Italian station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, confirmed the release: “Our co-citizens and other hostages are released.
"Now we control your health status," Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanians as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well and are in safety, Egyptian state television reports.
The 19 participants of the expedition in the desert are on the road to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible is the reasons for a shooting before the hostages were released: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudan army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed with the rescue,” the guard said.
It was just about "receiving the hostages" when suddenly came "this surprise."
On Sunday, the Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and two of them detained in the border zone between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded Germany to rescue six million euros; the money had to deliver the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom," referring to a German mediator, reported that release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their security.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after receiving the rescue.
The men had to stay detained until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected taking the position regarding this report.
Father abuse "took suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by her father-in-law led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after admitting eight charges of indecent assaults.
The Royal Truro Court, through an investigative study, knew he had regularly tied his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was aged five to seven.
Trerise wrote in a confession role: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court knew that Ms. Randle suicided at her Mutley house in Plymouth, April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tick her and blow her eyes before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working at a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to Cornwall.
His daughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court knew that Mrs. Randle, who used much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse she had been inflicted twice a week.
In 2006, Attorney Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Mrs. Rande had said about her, that after being a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead," as if she had "renounced to life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in her apartment in Plymouth.
Mrs. Rande was supposed to have killed herself by blowing up with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's father, who wrote a confession letter concluding: "I used to tick her and sell her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: “You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a terrifying experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking off his own life.
Even more clearly, it is that if she hadn’t done it, the matter probably wouldn’t have ended in courts.”
He added, "I noticed the effect that, according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother, the abuse was on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future.”
An officer charged by the loss of data
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents in the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a job trip by the Ministry of Defense, left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is certainly the least serious charge under the law and does not indicate the intention of criminal offence.
BBC Defense Correspondent Frank Gardner referred to the conviction as a surprise for many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause relating to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the official must be accused by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive entity of his work in the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information on Al-Qaeda and the capacity of security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and immediately moved from his home to a secret place.
Building companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face at a price of more than 80,000 pounds after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley bank.
Indeed, the government provided 14 billion sterling pounds to protect deposits from the bank’s 2.6 million savings.
The interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the savings money, including 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers that societies and their members have to pay.
Eventually, the 14 billion loan should be refunded after Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, the interest that arises in the interim is assumed to be charged every year to the 700 financial companies having deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that all 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved with prudence ... are called to pay today the price of the institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
That is, each of the companies had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and mediation companies had to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to £450,000 in 2009.
This means that societies will have to recover 81,000 pounds to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Commercial Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
“It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those that were much less prudent.”
According to the BSA, there is no data that indicates the failure of some society since 1945.
“We will have the need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction societies and their members from what could be a relevant price,” Cole added.
The interest in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of payable interests, which may be almost twice more.
Being the mutual construction societies organizations and not having shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest in their savings.
The price of milk rises five pencils per liter
The inhabitants of the Jersey street will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper announced that the highest price for dairy products will rise by an extra five-penny liter from next Monday.
It is the second price rise this year, after a two-pence rise in February and then research conducted by a consultancy company.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had risen before February, it was in 2002.
Denied freedom under bail to former prime minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladesh court has rejected the request for freedom under funding for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be led to prison when returning to her country.
His advocates said the court did not grant him the freedom under borrowing, accusing him of extortion of 50 million taka ($729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the various accusations of corruption at his office.
His long-term political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released under bail early this month.
Sheikh Hasina’s return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has required that the country’s government, militaryly supported, first grant him full freedom.
Correspondents say that as long as she was given conditional release to go abroad and receive medical treatments, it is now unclear what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Their attorneys say they make appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Superior Court.
“The Supreme Court rejected the request for freedom under borrowing for Sheikh Hasina arguing that he could not get freedom under borrowing why he was already in treatment abroad under conditional liberation,” said attorney Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will file an appeal against the Supreme Court order."
Her advocates argued that she needed bail freedom to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to his homeland after October 17, according to what an Awami League leader said last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the provisional government, supported by the army, took over power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatments.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges they are accused.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan, the UN says, have not been able to take advantage of a recent vaccine campaign against polio due to the violence of the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination program in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said it occurred despite the promises made by the Taliban that would not have attacked or hindered thousands of officials while carrying out vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge at ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission after the decision that forced the company to reduce its participation in the rival ITV broadcasting.
BSkyB has been informed by the Court of Appeals that it will have to reduce its share in ITV by 17.9% below 7.5%.
Precedingly, the Commission said that BSkyB’s interests hindered competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopolio Office reported that the acquisition of ITV stake by BSkyB was doubtful about ITV’s independence, and promoted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin Chief, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom regulator, opposed purchase.
BSkyB, commented that the forced to reduce his package on ITV was not reasonable and was a disproportionate remedy, particularly why, said BSkyB, would have delivered his voting rights.
New investigation in the assumption of U.S. lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Department of Justice's inspector-general criticized the administration officials' action.
The report criticized White House officials, legislators and former Producer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Attorney Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials interrogated during the investigation have lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Grave reports of possible criminal behaviors have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas said in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from their charges by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for low performance.
But later it was found that the lawyers had not been assessed worse than their colleagues, and many observers led to the conclusion that the dismissals would be motivated for political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked to pursue some Republicans, high-profile members of the Congress, while others had refused to investigate electoral fraud claims against Democrats.
These attorneys investigate and prosecute judgments for government
and can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The subsequent head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure for the resignations, resigned from his position.
A number of other officials of the Department of Justice did the same.
The Attorney General's report is very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in the matter, and underlines how he had a "primary responsibility" for the dismissals, which "abdicated" from his leadership position and was "notally non-collaborative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, Bush’s former collaborator, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf with a lot of honor
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for its epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will win the special prize next week at the ceremony to be held in London, said that getting this recognition will be "an honor".
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf won in 1977.
The Coldplay group is carrying nominations for this year’s awards and making the ranking of all four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-chief of Q magazine, said, “There are some songs that transcend time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them.”
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal capacity like that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and became number 15 in the classification.
However, Bat Out Of Hell of Meat Loaf remained around nine years in the rankings and came to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including a surgical surgery for his heart rhythm in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst in his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply in service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-term local residents, are difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends to the north of Primeira Calle – before I found the Second Street – between the Bowery and the Second Avenue.
This street, more than or less than 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty street road more than one active path.
There are no signs.
It is practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on Primiera Calle
who wants to repair Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the stores and boutiques that is expected to open in the new buildings.
Other fans include old-date neighbors who commented to be delighted by the trunked rail simply because it is one of the last remains of the past block before the appropriation of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development of the City, which has street control, has no interest in possessing it.
At the meeting of the Community of Victory Committee for Land Use that took place this month, representatives of the Avalon agency drafted a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to stay in the city, asked for a new plan to be presented next month, as said Susan Stetzer, Community District Manager No.3.
"The city is owner of very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," Mrs.
“We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage space, but we also want to guarantee public access to the street.”
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install a few seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea Avalon could buy the street emerged for the first time during the meeting this month.
But Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that even though the company wanted to use the street, he did not necessarily want to own it.
"The primary concern of Avalon Bay is the renewal of this abandoned street and the possibility of turning it into a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman of the Committee for Preservation, confirmed that it was a city wish to sell the street and noted that the agency’s mission is the development of property more than the management of it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a footprint in history.
Some believe that he obtained his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large property farm was divided between his children and this narrow land strip was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, was opened at Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that comes out on the cover of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
"The environment was great," said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"I was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers writing about East Village abortion, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, even modest they are, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare, virtually unchanged piece, a city rack that should be guarded.
Jeremiah Moss, who leads a blog named Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a city story talk about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a slightly narrow and unleaving street, dark also for the day and marked by doors of oxidised iron warehouse and counter-windows, with old weekly newspapers blowing along the channels."
With few exceptions, the street seemed more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat was cured through the back of the street and stood near the door used to enter the CBGB and now houses a luxury clothing shop.
Graffiti on the walls and a bottle of 22-oz empty beer were near a new lot of dismissed newspapers.
Some passengers said they rarely paid attention at Extra Place, but suggested they could be cleaned.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in his current state.
"I've spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet, and sharp places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Calling Hispanic voters effectively is a difficult business.
The proposals on education made by Barack Obama are the example of that.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that “African Americans and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and this is a very certain consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama’s education plan specifically advocates, among other things, “the bilingual transitional education” for English-English students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which he prefers in classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in cancelling the distance in the final results.
Let’s take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern region of Los Angeles County.
At this school, the vast majority of students are Hispanic and family lower-income:
More than a third of the students, many of whom newly arrived, are learning the English language.
However, an amazing 100 percent of the fourth year’s students have been positively evaluated in the 2008 mathematical exam.
and almost an equally amazing 93 percent has dominated the English language test and arts.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama’s favourite.
The Sixth Street school emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of skills and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
Furthermore, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the main of the Sixth Street, the school’s approach to the instruction of English to students is in “total immersion.”
Immersion in English means the nearly exclusive use of the language in the processing of the contents of the instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We have had extraordinary successes with students like this last who has arrived from Mexico and that if you enter class 12 months later you would not be able to pick up what was."
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model of replicating by other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of the politicians of its party on the matter of education (the Associations for National Education have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their same constant support for dark bilingual education the prediction of Mr. Obama's answer.
While it is that immigrants should learn English, Mr. Obama has recently trivialized the issue leaving people should stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English.
And instead, he said, "you should make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well, rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil Price Falls Suddenly After Renewed Economic Fears
The oil price was dramatically reduced on Monday because of the concern that the American rescue plan for the financial markets may not be able to reactivate the economy.
Raw oil shares decreased by 7% reaching $99.80 per barrel in the morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped by more than $20 per barrel since Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had dropped to nearly $90 per barrel early this month, before retreating again because of the huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
The anxiety grew up on investors on Monday, despite Congress leaders who said they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the rescue plan, the biggest in history.
The news was obscured by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from ending.
The evolution that took place in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the bank operations of Wachovia Corporation, according to what the government said Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said, on the frenetic weekend, negotiations that led to the rescue agreement “seem to have not been able to reactivate the feeling of the market.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected to reduce the demand for commodity, including oil.
“The prospects for global equity, interest rate and exchange will be increasingly uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
“We believe that commodity will not be able to escape this contagion.
From the perspective of the products, our most acute concern is the assessment of whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, such as low oil consumption due to the economic growth crisis and forecast of oil and gas price reduction is by 20 percent by 2009.
Second quarter of madness: team set record
After having passed, over the last eight seasons, longer than anyone in Jets' uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw things happen in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets turned a match unnoted into a game of desinflating.
“I’ve never seen anything like that,” Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played lazy under the dark clouds.
At this time it came to pass that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles achieving a 12-yards target and suggesting the perfect presumption for a afternoon, when the relationship evolution between the players had a great jump forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the room, one when one cornerback fell and another came with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't leave my way," Favre said from all the steps that went to Coles.
“He’s a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people can think.”
While Favre and Coles were played in the prison, the defense of the Cardinals abused quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed to another pass and intercepted him.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to miss by Warner.
In the last turnover, the faults forced by Bowens could have been the best.
The Cardenals had taken the possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yards hit to win a final 34-0.
These are the bigger points the Jets never made in a quarter.
The team coach, Eric Mangini, asked him to describe the madness of this moment, said, "The second quarter or third quarter?"
When both were answered - the Jets allowed 21 points without answer in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can say I liked the second quarter much more than the third quarter.
They have earned a lot of points in a very short period of time.”
Rested Gebrselassie leads its world record
Again, Ethiopia’s Haile Gebrselassie has demonstrated because many consider him the biggest corridor in history, surpassing his own world record in the Berlin marathon Sunday and guessing the first person capable of running the 26.2 miles race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the accommodated flat race at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has destroyed for 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, earned last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has established the 26th world record in a race of an impressive length so he has established a world championship or a world record for any distance, from the counter-watch race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, retrospectively - that air pollution will aggravate its problems with asthma.
Instead, he pointed out to run in Berlin.
In virtually perfect conditions - sunny and at 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, employing on average 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has decreased in more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa de Brasil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the victory last Sunday, Gebrselassie told journalists that he had suffered cracks in the crab two weeks earlier and that he had lost a week of training.
It is obvious that the suspension left it fresh, not oxidized.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told journalists.
“Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but at the end everything was okay.”
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism - especially in Kenya, the African-Eastern rival of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating too much his careers, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, based on the marks as if he was a race track, and putting the records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not decrease the greatness of Gebrselassie’s abilities as a runner.
On Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half the race at 1:02:04.
Two Kenya elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebrselassie after their markings decreased.
But shortly before three miles of the goal, Gebrselassie took a last boost to separate from Kwambai, who ended second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for nearly five minutes.
Kamathi arrived at the third place at 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, native to Kazakhstan but now German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Britain owns the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko, was a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She also never took part in the Beijing Games so she was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and establish her best record staff in nearly five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He did an intelligent calculation race, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners doing head and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia won the second place at 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop from Kenya ended third at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and testing of color life
Hidden by the expansion of the park to the theme of the great Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colosal city, is a quiet village, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first entirely inhabited city in the country and childhood place of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "The city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 colourful men, 300 good swimmers, many guyabes, two schools and neither a prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs Hurston, Harlem’s most famous Renaissance writer.
And, however, in many ways, the city she described – also making it a tourist stage by inclusion in the Florida Travel Guide produced by the Project of the Federal Writers of the Depression Season – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the '30s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resist to sharing their true ideas with the white man, "he knows so little about us and he doesn't know what is going to lose."
Even now, in the year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to start a dialogue on the race issue, many remain cautious in front of the alien.
“We are very cautious about how our story is told,” said Jones Hortense, 59, a resident of life and a member of the oldest church in the city.
"It's got to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and fight.
It is at the same time a historical model of black claims and a community of nearly 2,400 people living under a double poverty level of the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the black south - sometimes denied, others praised - that was born from slavery in America.
No wonder if those who live here are at the same time proud and reserved.
And the concern about the image of Eatonville really began with Zora, as no one calls Mrs. Hurston here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the center of Florida often forgotten into the history of blacks and human drama.
Having a face of cement both in life and in literature, Mrs. Hurston led her readers to the ownership store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then inside more private areas.
"Away from the road to the left," he wrote, "there is the modern monster public school with its white finishes, its well maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions the new husband of the widow Dash and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes away with transient rooms."
Thus, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston puts Eatonville in relation to the autonomous government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the girls Johnson that Mrs. Hurston immortalised quoting men who were singing colorless songs about her beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a living eccentric who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, he did it without notice in a big Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still today is proud of dressing with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many were laughing sarcastically.
"People were always rejoiced to see Zora," Mr. Franklin follows.
But, he adds, rolling on her chair in a rear courtyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never remained too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer stamped.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten her.
Although he was a literary star, a contemporary Langston Hughes and the only colored woman at Barnard College in the 20s, he was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he had been living.
In Eatonville there were no great commemorative ceremonies, nor great public readings.
“I don’t think her contribution to the world or her inheritance has been understood,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a biography from Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane road across the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane street of the working community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended it relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the '50s, the struggle for racial mixture led hate about the community.
"During that season, a group of white boys went through the city shooting oranges and everything against the people who were sitting next to it," Franklin said.
“They also killed a girl, once.
He was thrown against a car sandwich."
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted instead of honoring my race."
R Residents say today that the desegregation of schools, positive in some aspects, had weakened Eatonville’s cohesion and undermined the trust of their young people.
“Black children were used to be embraced – I remember this – they used to embrace the teacher in the morning and in the evening,” said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins’ daughter and Executive Director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"I wasn't embracing your teacher because it was white - there's a cultural gap there," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors, and artists who passed above prejudices, just like she did, with boyant, trust and lines like: “How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to the anonymous tomb of Mrs. Hurston and began to fight to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Ms. Hurston made by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the libraries, reintroducing it into American canons.
The road project came right at the time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again under the reflectors.
And this time, Ms. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of admirers arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return to the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
“The resurrected idea of the five-way road would have been to put in what you would call curvature speed, a true civic pride,” Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd said it simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the same city.
People outside town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to the church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historic Register in 1998.
A new library (bearing the name Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, over a repaid and beautiful Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from the center of Orlando, can sometimes feel like in a past street under a summer rain, in a city as small as that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Foreigners who come in search of the history of Eatonville, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A prior permission is needed to do most of the interviews, and some things - such as the walls in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has weakness for bright red, still fears that her island community can be misunderstood.
And, however, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of native pride has also emerged.
The young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville as Mrs Hurston saw her whole race: beauty, and all problems, not better, not worse, and also other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, worker, foolish and mixed.
It’s a honest civic sense what you can hear in Mr. Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins of Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville properly.
"Most people, in case they dare go to here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other," says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at your story, it’s a very nice city.”
Here, in New York, everyone speaks of finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If Manhattan tourists stayed away from the kiosks and the giant TV screens on Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the hurricane’s eye.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the bees nest offices that are above their heads, the bankers and speculative fund managers that monopolize New York face daily the worst "bad day of the office" since the fall of 1929.
Boys for home delivery continue to resonate their metal carts for tea through the steaks and carry muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin men continue to draw between charged apartment buildings, just like human mules, with 50 excentric printing shirts hanging on a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers still wait on the tail for their morning meals, and it remains impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on working days.
Employees are still waiting for their bagel tail to the carts of the sellers, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon in the days of the week.
I seemed like there was no crisis at all, until this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts there, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the calm afternoon at my local affiliate of JP Morgan Chase, a tail of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not ahead of the employee’s window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but ahead of the customer service bank, where customers of life order their check heels, tourists seek instructions to go to Macy’s large warehouses and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my “trustful personal banking,” and were in tail for the same reason as I.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places where they had switched them from, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money out of the so-called savings associations (a little bit like a construction society), the credit units and the savings boxes of their hometown whose whites only work within the state of belonging, and who claim to treat customers as their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion assets, went into failure, and as New Yorkers were heading home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with a saving deposit of $440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The workers of the offices and shops left in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank to what is considered a safe shelter, which is doing most of the rescue in Wall Street.
New York’s ordinary people have become finance experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking by phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and her afflicted aspect executive director, Dick Fuld, was familiar to comment on the matter as if they complained of a colleague’s inactivity.
And Lyn, fifty-five and something in my apartment block uniform, has changed the normal direction of our talks about Brad and Angelina or my purchases to the tender.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my monetary market fund savings.
Switching is done, I'm not taking any risk.”
Muslim tubes profaned at the time Austria approaches to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the Extreme Right Party for the Freedom of Austria and Belgian Filip Dewinter, affiliated to the Extreme Right Party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They carry traffic signals representing the mosques with a red line that crosses.
Police are blaming extreme-right extremists for profaning a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that the political parties of the extreme-right had made huge profits in the country’s general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at Traun’s cemetery near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning, in which police believe it was an organized action.
Criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as David’s Star over some of the tombs, but researchers think this may have happened by the attempt to hide the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident was somehow related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of profanation, which came to the Muslim religious when the Ramadan month was going to end.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the turn to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two extreme-right parties who held nearly 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Austrian Alliance for the Future, had conducted a campaign focused on anti-immigration veemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headwears and burkas, and also expressed his opposition to foods considered related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties aim to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the extreme right as the strongest political block in the country, indicate that the change occurred primarily by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel prohibition for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of sexual abuse of children, from traveling to France and Spain.
The judges imposed Glitter a six-month ban after he told surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police made the ban on traveling abroad last Thursday after the judges had produced evidence of the previous Glitter convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, a real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing in the Ashford magistrate court in Kent, but was represented by attorney Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: “On Thursday, September 25, at the Ashford Magistrate Court in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd’s travel abroad as to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad, under the registration of sex criminals.
He must inform the authorities in case he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
It is also necessary to inform the police of the planned date seven days in advance of their departure.
Kent’s police said they would not discuss the individual case or the possible location of Glitter in the county.
A Kent police spokesman said, “Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent police spokesman said, “Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
“From our point of view, it’s easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
“Safeguarding the inhabitants of Kent is the main concern of Kent police and we work closely to monitor the behavior of sexual criminals registered in the county and minimize any risks that may exist for the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls aged 10-11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
He said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and finally flyed to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied the entrance and he fled back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he returned to Britain.
He probably arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on August 22 and remained there while his attorney David Corker went to the Court of Justice in Uxbridge, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sex criminal.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of child abuse images.
A source from the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of Internal Affairs, was reassured and rejoiced to know that they had forbidden Glitter to travel to France and Spain.
"I can get the master out of scene to remove his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
Neither buckets nor flyers nor premiere costumes.
The essence of the great teachers of flamenco, stripped of concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the side of the artist.
To the other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, at those times away from the public, when finding the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look, or the expressivity of a hand, unpreoccupied because they’re not going to come out to scene.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some stage launches with singers, dancers and guitarists with that least known side of these teachers.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular flamenco iconography from different areas.
Included in the schedule of the Month of Flamenco Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of Flamenco, greater every day," explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be anyone but, seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed "in the street" are artists able to transmit on scene passion, sadness, joy... captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don’t have to take photos from the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco.
With the taste of the "Mine Chance" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plaque camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and material, remember classic photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classic base of the image, confiding him to modernity, which reflects how Bauer himself understands the flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day."
It is not the action of dance, singing or touching itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which captivates his art to the public.
The search for an encounter with the essential, with the duende that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work presented these days in the gallery El Photomata.
Known figures of the Flamenco such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of nearly seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of Flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the sample.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, meet them and be able to enter an instant in his life, whether long or short.
I think in photography the portrait is the hardest genre.
You meet or face people, characters, you sometimes do not know, or leave you just a few minutes to be able to take the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas reality.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco entitled "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the El Photomata Gallery, located in the 20th Street of la Mata, parallel to the Hercules Alameda, where you can visit until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is “a fearfulness”
Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to pushing forward the new project in which he works, a novel that has as protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The ever-favourite Nobel Prize for Literature confessed yesterday in his passage to the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today occupies him is "a fear" and that "everything indicates that he shouldn't write" the novel.
"If I was wise, I wouldn't, but I hope I'm going to finish it ever," he concluded in his intervention at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that he has seen for four days go through the city of the Acueduct to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and Dogs" was one of the highlighted figures of the third edition of the party of the word and complied with the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival Award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an ancient edition of "Our mutual friend", by Dickens-, filled the aphore of theatre Juan Bravo.
Presented by Felix Romeo, he found to himself a audience given to whom he was very short the hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, revised how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the “extraordinary adventure” that is inspired by the “pleasing of reading” and “living more than he lived”;
The Hispanic American novel acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that this "has effects" and "makes people more incompatible," so he asked the writers "not to leave responsibility."
The climatology deteriorates Pozoblanco fair that also remains untouched
The gateway party that closed the subscription of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the gateways announced that the floor of the square was not in the best conditions.
Thus, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
Weather inclemences have rained with this fair, as two of its three celebrations have finally not been able to celebrate.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bull race.
The cartel composed José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a Castilblanco enclosure.
Only Friday was there a feast.
In him, the triumph was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and came out to the shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante went out his two steeps with greetings and one ear, which gave the steeps more than his toreo.
Yes, even worse was El Juli, which passed through the cow of Los Llanos without penalty or glory.
In his second bull, after a faena of relief, he won the broke of a large part of the audience.
Control in Álava is jumped in a van with two thousand kilos of hashish
Five at least ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipal term Armiñón (Alava).
The agents give up the two occupants of a truck and they take the flight.
Their cargo, more than two tons of hashish, was not like to stop.
The agents pursued and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male, identified as A. A. J., according to the Basque Government's Department of Interior.
The arrested person has been accused of drug trafficking and counterfeiting public documents.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the Arab Traffic Unit carried out a transport control at the N-1, as they passed through the municipal term of Armiñón.
They were ready to stop a van for their inspection when the driver disobeyed the orders, suddenly accelerated, and the control was leaped.
The agents started their persecution until the vehicle stopped a couple kilometers later in the arc, time when its two occupants armed to flee to the race through a forest area.
The Ertzains finally reached one of them and captured the 2,178 kilograms of hashis they carried and found after inspection of the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with hashish burdens, so they moved to police offices for a comprehensive inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, officials found that the registration was "doubled" as it did not coincide with the collection of the van's documentation, so an offence of public document falsification has also been charged with the arrested.
Ertzaintza continues with the investigation to proceed to the detention of the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as said, and to determine the origin of the captured drug.
The detainee, 28-year-old A. A. J., was transferred to police offices to carry out the corresponding diligence and will be available in the next hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the effects of some drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medicine.
A witness saw her perform strange manoeuvres when trying to leave her parking in Montecito, a spokesman for the California road patrol has revealed to the People magazine.
The witness has detailed that about 16.30 hours, Locklear “was stepping deeply on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to take the car out of the parking space forward and backward, and as she walked back, she went several times above her sunglasses.”
Shortly afterwards, the witness, who apparently had not recognized the actress, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and left the vehicle.
This person was the one who warned emergency services because “he was worried about Locklear’s life.”
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, who was partially blocking the road.
"It seemed disoriented," so the agents brought her to the specialized drug and alcohol center to perform a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and excess alcohol was dismissed from the first moment, although “according to the officers at first sight, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drugs.”
Locklear was arrested as a suspect of driving under the effects of some substance that has not been specified and entered the local prison at 19.00 hours although it was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where she recovered from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Calling urges the Andalusian Federation of IU to assume its competences in the case of Silva
U.I. General Coordinator and Left Unida Deputy Gaspar Llamazares said today that it will be the regional formation federation to make a decision on the case of former Youth and Sports Councillor of the City Hall of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of making family treatment.
“I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to take over its competences,” he said on the action that the party will have to take with which he will so far be councillor in the Sevillan consortium.
However, the UI leader advocated that the need for “transparency” to be present in possible investigations on the irregularities Silva could have committed: “UI has always advocated that such matters have the maximum degree of transparency.”
In the same line he stressed that training has "strict ethical codes for all public offices".
'May Blood', Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French in Blood of May, which is the most ambitious film in his film with nearly 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried "to illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" which he has always admired in the work of the well-known novel, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the front of a wide range of interpreters.
Blood of May, with a film of more than two and a half hours, is released on Friday in the cinema halls, to become the future in a mini-series for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
The great fan of Galdós literature, José Luis Garci, assures that he had accomplished this film "a childhood dream", which should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Madrid Community three years ago told him to shoot a commemorative tape for the second centenary of May 2, which he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budgets that the Community of Madrid has entirely provided constitute Garci’s “one opportunity” to settle the portrait of “an atlound Spain that was wrong to fight for, as the struggle for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII.”
But the filmmaker regrets not having financed such as Alatriste or The Ghosts of Goya – more than twice that of Blood of May – so he has not been able to shoot some scenes drawn in a script signed next to Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost his entire career.
Therefore, the director of Return to Start has focused on how it is his usual form of work, staging with the actors, with whom he usually tries before starting the shooting and whom he doesn’t cast, because he seems “humid” and considers that “part of the director’s office resides in going to the theatre and film to know what happens in the industry in which he works.”
Many of the interpreters who coincide with in Sangre de May repeat before their camera, such as Miguel Rellan, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
A Oscar candidate four times – of which he won one, Garci believes that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year in front of the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, Seven French billiard tables and the finally selected, The Blind Sunshines, do not represent a young generation of Spanish film, "which is the one to be known."
With this movie, Garci does not expect awards.
“In the beginning you think you’re working for posterity, then you realize that you’re only working for prosperity, and now you’re pleased to make another movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional path.
Isabel Bayon regains the essence of dancer sevillana Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer is going to honor a Sevillan dancer too.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana district and when he was three years old moved to London with his family.
She was a free dance dancer and specialist in eastern dances.
He had an exciting life, pioneer of the release of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the Corse that prevented free female movement.
The life of this woman who marked a dancing and aesthetic revolution in the Europe of between wars fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character and it seemed amazing to me."
According to the dancer, “we do not intend to tell his life but pick up his spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested me flamenco stacks.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" suggested me a guajira, or "the snake dance" a few tangos.
His dance was sensual and to me have been told that my dance is also inside this aesthetic.”
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: the of Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one in her shows, just like he did in the "The Open Gate"; and the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whom her student was.
"Matilde makes Tortola larger, the character of maturity.
I am happy because I have agreed to act in my work and I feel very honored for it.”
The assembly also features the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "which makes the role of the eternal accompanier of this kind of artists whole and all in their extension.
In the work, the life of this woman who developed in such far-reaching places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, in addition to all over Europe, is also somehow counted as she habitually resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her because I think it’s among those women who have a huge influence at a given time and now no one knows and much less puts their work in value,” says Bayon.
The show will start today at 20.30 a.m. at the Lope theatre of Vega.
The publication of "Diary of a newly married poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Reciprocated Poet" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is framed within the activities scheduled by the Nobel Cultural Council of the Board of Andalusia and the Board of Literature both to celebrate the "Threennium Zenobia and Juan el Ramón" (2008).
In this way, the "Threenio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-editing of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum House and with the roaming exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That chopo de light", which was inaugurated last May and that, after traveling through the various provinces of New York.
Also, the Council of Culture of the Board of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Recently Married Poet", published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Lack of Malicia," and gives the idea of the American film’s and all of America’s disappearance, in front of the stunning idea that Newman has gone.
Look, it cost them to give them an Oscar.
It has been retired since 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
It was still a massage for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels is beyond every expression, and I’ve now lost a great friend,” Robert Redford cried, “my life and my country were better thanks to their existence.”
No one was afraid of making ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and homeland had died at a particularly dark moment, fearing terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem for the grounds, looking desperately for reasons for dignity.
When the time is so hard and without virtue men and very few beings to admire you are left, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for everyone an almost platonical ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the formal enemy of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and earned causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his firstborn dead by overdose to his brand of home and organic food.
A whole gift to a country that has cost a lot to overcome a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of Hollywood admiration barried without attending nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, found that no man has died but an era.
Another English, Oscar director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was neither more nor less than the summit of his career.
The evil boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his biggest inspiration.
“We’ve left the list very high to all,” said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few daring to try to live as Paul Newman lived today: keeping the demand for probity high and having a serious and private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in today’s media jungle.
But someone tries, and Paul Newman is his example.
He once divorced but then was married fifty years with Joanne Woodward, who was faithful when he surely had the opportunities to not be.
"But why am I going to eat burger outside of the house, if inside I have a filet?" he used to joke himself.
In the sky he assists him with the pride that his daughters on earth coincide with his fans, something not so common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, no one was as proud of his devoted husband, loving father, solitary grandfather and dedicated philanthropist,” he said.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is to celebrate Olympics in Madrid and, after the failure 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday’s race, I say no!
The perfect race was called her, and in my opinion it's been the worst race I've been in.
A full of disproposals that, of course, if they considered it as an assessment and I would examine it would be a very clear suspension.
But let’s go through parts and from the beginning.
The disappointments begin with the collection of the backbone, which makes you have to go earlier.
What doesn’t seem bad to me, but if you already get to give everything (including the chip to avoid tails in the race).
Well, no.
Here they just made you go to pick up the back (first disappointment, go only for that) and (behind the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second disappointment, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live?
Or have they decided to buy only small shirts with less fabrics and cheaper?
Well, these things are a career compared to those of the race day.
Apart from having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the tail when it comes is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
More than 35 minutes was waiting, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as it was to be expected, the race began and we had not left the backpack yet, although once achieved, the pick up was worse.
In addition, the rain relieved the waiting for more than 40 minutes, which was joined with popular rebellion conates and assault to the cassette.
I think about 500 people will surely have lung tomorrow, and some like me, will not even appear with the right time in the classification, because of the chip that, I guess, didn’t mark the output correctly.
Of course, if I was asked about the perfect race, this would not enter my thoughts.
So I think we will keep dreaming of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft searches for receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft has shown an advance of a new system of human image recognition and interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a launch to move through the company’s campus) by listening to the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receiver" can know how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group those present according to conversation groups.
In the video show, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to her and is not an employee of the company.
Ask him if he’s there to visit someone and tells him he’ll answer him soon.
All without blue screen.
Wonderful.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week has been talking much above a strategy change in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essential instead of charged commercial rubbish, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
One entire find in mind that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is grateful.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, as well as software.
When Google Chrome left the network, I was one of the ones that joined the theory that it was Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Many pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the layer essential for hardware and software to be understood.
Fulfill the same role as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but one must think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute, but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People increasingly pay less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts only to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the windows environment.
What are half of the applications that come in the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and which are ultimately an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
The picture of this post took it in one of Microsoft’s employee resting rooms, in Redmond, early this month.
In the refrigerator a poster asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft’s employees were using Google to search on the network.
Last week, by the way, a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also confirmed.
It won’t come in early 2009, but in the end, rather than shooting in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more and more computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, will pass invoice.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried her on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio looked like a "Blood Diamond" by Edward Zwick, the same as Al Pacino in "El Padrino" by Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the uniform of the musculated gay parish.
And if we start to listing star appearances, we can go back to the picture of that forty pointed mud that raised weights in an ambulant circus.
In essence, it is only the typical male interior t-shirt in cotton, strained and sleeves-free.
The tank, which calls the Anglo speakers, but the Fabuloux Marcel de Bruxelles demonstrates over all the others.
First, for her shocking name - although it is familiarly known as 'Marcel' - it has to do with the sport because he receives her name, according to the legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out over others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the most iconic shirt models carry as a detail in the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm is not only focused on its tank tops.
Also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marine shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Wears designed for comfort underwear.
It is a pity to leave them like underwear.
They're too charming.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry."
His huge resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the sisters Cruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than some beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that Mango makes at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards than the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, wins in short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I’ve come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have designed for Mango this new autumn-winter season, as well as attending the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the Opera’s dinner in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day but at the same time, exciting.
What is your new collection for Mango based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the movies of the 50s and 60s; from there we draw a lot of references.
Then I really like to lose myself through a city and watch women as they are dressed, as they combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very polifacetic woman, right?
I think yes, but, in the end, everything joins and have many ties in common.
I liked clothes since I was little; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to hurry in my aunt's wardrobes and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the attraction park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I was dressing.
You know that dancers like to make our stylisms for classes and essays, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when you get the clothes is when you really find the character.
Then, everything goes together, that is, with a lot of respect to designers and professionalism.
You didn't meet 30s long ago, have you come into crisis?
It's all right.
I feel better than ever, I like all 30.
I find that a woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
The biological watch doesn’t scare me.
I have done the things I wanted since young and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think of being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because the body asks me for it and, moreover, I want to be a young mother; this I don't want to lose it.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give a lot of happiness to my son and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the movie, you’re looking for several premieres you played last year.
That's how it's and I'm looking forward to seeing the light.
I, who am a woman coming from theatre, I am very impatient and disturbed, everything I want for already and of course, can't be.
I’m looking forward to ‘The Last Minute’ and ‘In search of the tomb of Christ’.
Seeing you look like...
You debuted a few days ago on a gateway with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, well, don't say that.
I'm not going up to a gateway to make a model.
Simply called me Naomi Campbell, whom I know for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a beneficial parade for his organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we exhibited - I took two pieces from our collection for Mango - he was auctioning to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi.
They say so many things about her that, I know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I’m with that good part she’s involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he comes to ask me to make the pine, so too.
To benefit women from the third world, whatever is needed.
Alcohol-recurring drivers must install the 'alcohollock'
Interior wants the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcoholemia, has to install a system that prevents the drunk vehicle from starting, or if it does not blow.
The initiative has already been announced last June and is now included in the annual memory of the State Attorney General, according to which it is a pilot project that will last a year.
Their purpose is the driver’s reintegration, so the driver will also receive a road reeducation course.
In the experience, in addition to the Vial Security Prosecutor’s General Office, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers reported more than once for driving drunk to take the car again.
The alcohollock would avoid it as it is a vehicle-connected system that measures the rate of alcohol in air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow abdomen; or when an alcohol concentration is detected is higher than the allowed.
Its cost is greater than 1,000 euros and would run on behalf of the sanctioned.
In this regard, a study conducted in the U.S. in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce offences during the first year of deployment by up to 65%.
In Spain, it is estimated that it could save 115 people every year.
The measure relates to administrative sanctions for two reasons: addressing these behaviors before they lead to criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, as legal reform can be made by ordinary way, and, however, the necessary criminal reform requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial modality, although it has already been deployed experimentally in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of the Members will vote tomorrow on a PSOE initiative in which it is intended to install this system in school buses, as has been held in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
At time, at 17.40 p.m., the time planned in the program, he landed at the Benito Juárez airport Presidential Hangar at Mexico DF the Spanish air force plane on which the Princes of Asturias travelled.
The sun was withdrawn but its rays still forced to use the hand as a visa to see the real couple descending from the plane.
The Spanish Ambassador and other authorities.
Hours before I had asked the taxi driver about the street if he knew the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very good, then you can't go to the airport to load at that time... she's from here or so...
- No, no sir, she's a Spanish, but she lived here a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the journey.
Many are waiting at the airport hangar stick to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 navy soldiers who interpret the savings of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the Princess, melent to the wind, very sobriety, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps had reported her in the DF threatened storm.
They give photographers a smile and a squad stop before going to the room in which the official committee awaits.
At the door of the hotel where you stay, one of the four largest in the city, a Mexican TV reporter is waiting for you.
The best equipped fashion award
Perhaps there is no place in the most appropriate world to present a fashion award, that Paris and possibly there is no more exquisite and bont living designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of The Boton-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is awarded a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, the Belgian winner of the first edition, Sandrina Fasoli, looked at her designs at the Mango showcase at the number 54 of the Haussmann boulevard in Paris and almost crying about the excitement.
By the way, it is the second largest shop in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first one is in London.
So many events, united to the desire to thank designer Valentino who chaired the jury of the contest, made us finish at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the Mango-prepared presidential gala table looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with the heart broken of pain and making hearts, for the recent death of his brother, was wearing a suit of the House and a few ELAH adhesives, who cut the breath, and the arm of his son Luis - a nearly two-metre-length canyon - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his homage dinner.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, made the honors and he was so gentleman that he ended, next to the baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had borrowed them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the shop with pants and shirt - of his own design - and for dinner he was transformed in a black long sexy dress, was excited when on the night ride by the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, was taught us the ballet trial room and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a lover.
Inés Sastre did not walk through the departments of the palace, but taught us on the mobile phone photos of his son.
The next morning we could rejoice the view with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another motorcycling canyon - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels, and having previously asked for no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are no 1000 but 1000 more one way to forget the chaotic and frenetic daily life.
And if little, they are all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to the libraries on September 30.
The awakening almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse to imagine being wrapped in the stirring pace that imposes today’s life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and disconnection problems with the labour world.
No, the number goes up to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Besides yoga positions, classic massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together a whole 'menu' of possibilities tailored to the taste and minutes of each book pages.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 Ways to Relax' and its calm will reach the handbooks of editorial Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone considers that it is not possible to reach calmness in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this ‘manual’ disobeys such belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in touch with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the sofa, disconnect your mind and focus on reading.
Speaking asleep
Some children talk at night.
I don’t mean those who are awakened to tell us something that happened the day before, but children speaking asleep.
The first time it happens, you might have a fear, but it really doesn’t matter.
It is a benign sleep alteration that is called sleepy.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one has told him he spoke at night.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadicly (once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (all days, once a week, once in meseS...), the following day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause to determine its appearance.
They often relate to other sleep alterations as are usually nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis, or sleeping, but they don’t have to be so.
As already mentioned above, they may also be associated with very high fever paintings, stress or overexcitation situations.
It is, however, a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It may be that I speak in a quiet tone of voice, loose words, a murmur or all the opposite (crying, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the demonstration is very intense, it would be appropriate to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check whether there is any issue that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives him out of this way.
We have said it is a benign alteration, therefore you have no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep alteration that can be treated (e.g., if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress painting).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to sleep.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are afraid or a little violent.
With very nervous children and which cost them a lot to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a certain inner calm.
This will encourage the child to have a calmer dream.
Once the sleeps appear try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day they won’t remember anything of what happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and he's therefore resting.
Remember that if you are very anxious during several episodes it would be appropriate to consult or find out what is what generates so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what it says (which is not the most common thing), don’t fall into the temptation to interrogate you for information.
You won’t get anything, because when you’re asleep, you’re not aware of how to organize your thought.
Also you will hear what he says, but you don’t know what he’s dreaming to say that, which is very careful about how you interpret the information and with the conclusions that you draw.
You never tell the child who can interrogate him at night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That causes a lot of anxiety.
In short, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s an episode that lasts just a few minutes.
Illhaeesern finally!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the path of victory in his field after a long period of shortage.
Without making a good match, the team created many goal occasions and was able to make a goal to win the match.
The pace was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann who sprayed the squad with a shot from a distance, Illhaesern was almost taking the "power" and by turn Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn up, Romain with the foot tip or also Diebold came to stop Dannemarie's defense.
Ahead, we didn't let the midfielder pass and only left Riahi in an attack position.
The beginning of the second time was crucial, first with two occasions of goal from Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the scorer for the Illhousians with the goal of Marais, well located to pick up the ball rejected in a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Illhousian goalers will not be able to taste their happiness long and will be forced to return to the wardrobes a dozen minutes later and thus leave their teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie won't take advantage of the occasion and it won't be a problem for the eleven Illhousians who went back a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after a major farfull, the ball went very close to the cross-country field.
Sarkozy finds fishermen furious
Before leaving to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a rodeo for Britain.
Faced with the manifestation of resistance by the fishermen who heavily disturbed the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the president of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to meet his representatives there.
These promised to welcome it "in a constructive spirit " and hope that it " comes with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general board of the " crisis committee " established by the Breton fishermen to achieve measures against the increase in gasoil prices, which marks a record when reaching €1.14 per liter.
According to Eliseo spokesman David Martinon, the president “will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies re-competitive and to save the conditions of jobs and remuneration of sailors.”
Fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy on foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce circulation in the Morbihan and in the Calvados, which thus led to nearly 10 km stacks.
Quiberon’s marina has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-île have not been stopped.
" A filter barrier" has been placed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning, scratching the dawn, tires and wood pallets in front of fuel tanks in the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Mancha, such as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the boues stayed in the port, or in Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of trade vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantic region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the major Total Donges refinery.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until the Wednesday meeting that will take place at the ministry to think about eventual actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think about the development of the movement and its participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris on Tuesday.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the national fishing committee, which did not sustain their movement.
"The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not leave " and " they do not want to move to Paris ", for example Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on gas oil, currently pay about 50 cent per liter but believe that the financial balance point of a ship can be reached only with a gas oil at a price less than 0.30 euro per liter.
The Magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of " Two Men and One Destiny " has died from cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes greeted the film legend and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who has died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession in the world economy.
The world’s fourth aeronautical builder, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 delivered equipment, Embraer’s president Fredrico Fleury Curado reaffirmed.
During the first half, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian builder has a lot of trust in the Chinese market particularly to sell aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to sell more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, who has been taken out of trouble thanks to U.S. monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets with the aim of reimbursement of its $85 billion loan, according to the Financial Times Sunday edition.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international living insurance and retirement insurance in the United States, the newspaper needs.
The AIG Board met last Sunday afternoon to examine eventual sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
AIG’s assets are intended to separate include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share in Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, the Financial Times added.
No final decision has been made about these sales, the Financial Times pursues.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to reimburse its 85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve at risk of seeing U.S. authorities to take 80% of its capital, diluting it with the proper proportion of current shareholders.
Analysis of the historical session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98 percent, that is a loss of nearly 800 points ever seen in the Stock Exchange, and the Nasdaq 9.14 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial index dropped from 777.68 to 10.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most significant fall in his history (684.81 points) had been recorded last September 17, 2001, i.e. the day on which the exchanges started again after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The technological dominant Nasdaq index dropped back 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the wide index Standard & Poor's 500 by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 units, according to the final closure figures.
Already depressed by the crisis in the early session, Wall Street dropped after the unexpected refusal by the House of Representatives of the plan to save banks that would have allowed to recover some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives denied the media he requested to U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.
Nearly two Republicans in each three rejected their plan.
“That’s not a good signal sent to the market, which Congress sees unable to adopt a plan,” Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial, said.
"This shows how much the market had this plan," Lindsey Piegza added, fearing a project adopted within several days will come "too late."
“If the project is really dying (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take the relief (the American central bank, the N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would further press the credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, head of Economics and Finance at Global Insight.
And increasingly emphasizing the feeling of urgency, "Every passing day is announced the fall of a financial institution " in the United States, Ms. Piegza emphasized.
After Washington Mutual’s bankruptcy last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s bank activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, causing emergency interventions in the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, showing that markets face “not only a crisis in the U.S. but a global crisis,” FTN Financial analyst added.
The obligation market has risen dramatically.
The 10-year-old treasury bonus yield declined 3.632 percent, compared to 3.827 percent on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year-old bonus declined 4.161 percent, compared to 4.357 percent on early day.
Obama, winner during the first television duel
On Friday’s first debate between both candidates at the White House, another happened to find out who has triumphled between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this television duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, although honorable, was not “so bright” to allow him to stop his decline in polls to five weeks of the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion survey published the past Saturday grants five points of advantage for Obama (49 percent against 44% for McCain), judges that it was the Democrat who went well.
Among the undecided voters, which are those who count, Obama came to win with 39% of respondents, while 25% of respondents grant McCain victory, according to a CBS survey.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the good expected benefit of his member of his same candidate, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
“It has good instincts,” I warn, however, Bill Clinton this weekend.
The septuagint McCain pointed out his indisputable experience in foreign policy, emphasizing his adversary’s “ingeniery” on these issues that were at the heart of this first care.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president,” he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television advertising.
Obama said it represents the future.
Without disappointment, it was concise and accurate.
He boosted his ability to make the right decisions, and restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done it," he replied this weekend, a Democratic television advertising that blamed the Republican for not having considered the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans.
“During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had met for an electoral meeting in North Carolina in a deep rain.
He did not pronounce the words "middle class" or "workers". "Financial defeat clearly favors Obama, which is considered by Americans as the most able character to save the economy that is on the edge of the precipitation.
"Next week could be a decisive episode," he estimated yesterday, influential and Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration limb, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster "is the final eight-year consequence of a bad economic policy enforced by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that it would come despite reducing taxes of 95% of Americans despite Wall Street’s outbreaks, Illinois’ senator also noted that the realization of an eventual energy independence from the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the creation of a health and safety system.
McCain wants to build a 45-nuclear power plant park by 2030.
Clearly, both candidates avoided issues relating to the $700 billion ($470 billion) financial rescue plan adopted by Congress yesterday afternoon and extremely unpopular.
" In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated last Sunday afternoon at the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of legislators in advance.
Some hundreds of Belarus gathered Sunday afternoon since the closure of electoral centers in Minsk central square to protest against the fraudulent character of legislatures.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexandre Lukachenko: "The dictator, he has to resign."
Some acknowledge that they have not voted, "why, since they will do what they want with my vote," a young man says.
They do not believe that the regime that made foreign observers good face in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to make a democratic change.
Sanctions, including the ban on visas for 40 Belarus leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered clean for observers.
It was not according to the opposition.
"We have been placed next to the electoral committees and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of the votes," said Youri Potemkine, the spokesman of the Union of the Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate to the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, is the executive power.
If some members of the opposition enter the parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
"But their entry into parliament may mean appearances on television, meetings in the regions and bill proposals."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must be started.
Because if our economy, which has many debts in front of Russia, comes into crisis, and if we do not reform, we are at risk to become a Russian protectorate.
But we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the vote.
It emphasizes that participation figures seem too high, and that the generalization of vote in advance (26 per cent of Minsk voters) favored manipulation.
"Have you noticed the elections? He interrogates the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the electoral centers.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition to the parliament, those better suited to power.”
The silence of the night returns to the October Square.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the electoral central committee congratulate themselves for their success.
Interview - Blood Returns to Safe
Hema-Québec celebrated his 10th anniversary of his foundation yesterday, and his president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice because Hema-Québec has again become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he regained the trust of the public that had been seriously emptied by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this drama and the discontent of the public, the government of Canada made in February 1994 a public survey, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, intended to clarify the circumstances that had led to such tragedy and formulate recommendations so that such disaster was no longer reproduced.
While Judge Krever took a long time to present his relationship, certain provinces then created a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mission.
As a result of the reports by Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began her activities, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Decary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
After making a lot of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work over the years following, we have recovered the public’s confidence,” he says before proudly claiming that in the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population had the subsequent confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that " trust is something extremely fragile ".
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec applied the principle of precaution.
At that time, we attended in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of the mad cow’s disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease, Decary counts.
And we didn’t know if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
Then we support one of the main recommendations of Krever and Gélineau’s reports, according to which when we don’t know and when a serious illness can arise from that, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that is characterized by a brain degeneration that inevitably leads to death, we introduced exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had remained more than a month in the UK since the 1980s.
But a few years ago, it has been proven out of doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
This episode showed us that the principle of precaution that was applied was meaningful.”
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique of detection of HIV appeared on the market: nucleid acid testing that allows donors to detect directly in the blood the presence of the virus and not the presence of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
Nucleid acid tests allowed to shorten the period between the time the person has been infected and the time the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
We could reduce this period to less than a week.
We thus substantially decrease the risk that certain donors are infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements allowed significantly to lower the risk of AIDS due to blood transfusion.
Today, one per 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-polluted blood.
“This means it will have to distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected with HIV.
Thus, since Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products every year, they will spend more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood product occurs.
I think today you can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without concern,” said Hema-Québec’s head of management.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Meeting, which, for example of the Western Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant,” Dr. Décary follows before emphasizing that in addition to safe supply, Hema-Québec should also provide sufficient supply.
“Needs increase because the population ages.
Since more aggressive anti-cancer treatments, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has consequences on the blood donor network that groups on average only 3% of Quebeques eligible for blood donation. "
All persons with good health, 18 years of age and who meet the eligibility criteria can however donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who propose their blood are not accepted because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they traveled in a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
“With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Penuries are very rare.
But members of this donor network must be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to don their blood, but above all to hold them and encourage them to be regular donor.
Since today’s life is very unfreeful, we rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate your blood,” Francine Decary said.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eye balloons and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burned.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was previously considered biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of stem cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
“We have celebrated a few weeks ago, the placement at the bank of our thousandth sample of blood from the umbilical cord and it is expected to take out more than a thousand of them a year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts at the beginning of next year," precises Dr. Decary who describes this cord blood taking program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they are unable to enjoy this," since Hema-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - The Impact on the Semi-Finals
The Montreal Impact was qualified for the semi-finals of the eliminatory series of the first USL division, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 finals in short) victory at the cost of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday during the second and decisive match of the quarter-final series, at the Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without goal anywhere, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many goal occasions.
Roger Levesque was the only che destroyed Matt Jordan by the Sounders.
Remember that during the first game of the round-trip game series on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the Seattle suburb.
The impact will be measured to the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-final.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the back match to take it for 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless agreed to the semi-finals for 5-4.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps on Friday and next Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
Soon – The Victorious Goal of Kovalev
Canadian number one trio is willing to start the season.
The composed unit of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a 3-2 Canadian gain to the barrier free shots in front of the Florida Panthers yesterday night at Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec gathered two aids, and Kovalev gathered a pass on this winning, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian said.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play the maximum in the first time, said Guido Carbonneau.
But I think it appreciated the end of the match.
He had a beautiful ovation."
Charest takes care of the North
Prime Minister does not exclude launching elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest went yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new minister of health, Yves Bolduc (left) tries to be elected during today's partial election.
Reject the boundaries of our last large northern border: this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength leaving in the large lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
On three immense screens, they showed spectacular images of hydroelectric, mining packages, Quebec viewed by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great media as during the election period.
The prime minister thinks the elections will take place this fall, although he saw his schedule was very full.
The "North Plan" is the fourth side of a "vision" that the Prime Minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which comprises an agreement on the labour with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in recent Prime Minister's speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory to 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
Nevertheless, the Prime Minister was limited to explaining why the North was "a jewel to the immense potential " but did not give a term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could mostly be more developed is: particularly hydroelectricity, forest, but especially the mining sector, dominated by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond," according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This " twice large territory like France ", " is our home, is in Quebec.
Not only is it home ours, but it is in us,” he insisted, as to show that he requested a national founding myth.
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relationship with the North, he emphasized: the laughter towards gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
“It belongs to us, it’s our future,” he added, after having taken a theatre break to look at the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of the Quebec territory, comprises a portion of the Labrador that Quebec always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
There is a border line in which they haven’t agreed for a long time, and when the occasion is presented, I re-establish that position of the government,” he said.
Furthermore, "with climate changes, we must rethink our vision of the North," he declared speaking of the Northwest passage, which will open every year due to the casting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that occupating the territory is a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and the project would benefit them, particularly to young people.
Two former ministers coming from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the Ungava Quebec Party), have already begun consultations near a thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role began some works.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " but a meeting in which " a common vision will be given ".
Northern development would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan " will be concerted, ordered and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a vision that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought otherwise to transform challenges into new growth and development occasions."
This was one of the recurring weekend issues, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to emphasize the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s arrival to the power of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes rebuilding the Central Beauharnois in Embalse Adélard-Godbout.
“De Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa that made the James Bay our party known to forge the future,” said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Touching the theme of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric packaging project, Mr. Charest stressed that its implementation is scheduled for 2012.
"This remains between us, but I predict to be there," he entrusted his militants, raising applauses.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that they would not take place elections in 2008 and undoubtedly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, which law allows him.
It emphasizes that its schedule is nevertheless full, particularly because of a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York Summit.
The general council provided the liberal chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " which had no problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec in particular claims the recognition of the " Quebec specificity " in the Constitution.
He also wishes Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto right on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcome the major lines of the North Plan with skepticism.
The head of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, reaching power in 2003, resigned to apply it.
If I had done so, "we would have progressed today," said Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (voting today), Françoise Mercure.
Quebec's Democratic Action seemed to support the adoption of a Northern Plan from the government.
“But what is desired is that this isn’t just a show,” said Sebastien Proulx, in replacement of Mario Dumont, who returns on holiday today.
Letters - A Dishonorable Country
He is Mr. Vic Toews, former "justice minister" (oh irony!) at Harper's cabinet, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "shame" for Canada.
In this way, dishonor this woman who has led an incessant fight for justice and deserves all our admiration what he says about the relationships of Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated his national who is locked in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are recruited to him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, rejects its promise and lets a child-soldate live in inhuman conditions.
The only one who holds a false justice to assess the guilty of the accused.
Remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers particularly support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to enjoy the benefit of an equitable process in Canada.
It is this government that closes eyes over torture: it doesn’t care if a young adult is psychologically destroyed, undoubtedly forever after so many years of exactions.
We don’t realize that yet, but at this moment we attend an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy,” that’s the word Harper continues to repeat and it doesn’t make sense.
The time has already come when no moral exists any more: we can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the minority chief of government so far wants (what will happen after October 14?).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that praises Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what was doing the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews' shame is caused by this resignation and for nothing else.
Free Review - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In his September 17th edition, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice President and Director of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world’s largest author company tried a defamation of six million euros against three authors and a small editorial house in order to provoke a “transparent public debate.”
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of persecution for defamation, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to carry a public debate would be to harm anyone who dares hold a position contrary to his?
The outcome of the trial is little important, the authors and the publisher of the Noir Canada book must spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and to fight against an army of lawyers held by almost backgroundless pockets of the mining.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, often consists of ruining the defendants in order to impose a friendly arrangement that will bother the opposition in addition to frightening anyone who will dare to examine the issue again.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it is before the public opinion that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, Canada’s debates are usually done for the change of ideas and not clutches.
It was therefore enough for the mining to open its books, files, and to establish a true debate, through newspapers, media, publications, and the funding of independent search teams that would have been able to clarify the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust public opinion and rejects requests and support letters for Noir Canada’s authors.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he can ask for a "public" debate despising his opinions?
According to the Vice President, this word seems to name only highly paid lawyers and not all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What he doesn't understand - or what he doesn't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the audience that supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does so above all because he rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but having as a basis civilized changes in arguments, and not in the framework of what many people perceive as a persecution-mordial (persecuting the " public debate," Barrick Gold has just filed a request with respect to Noir Canada's authors by urging them not to use this word anymoread).
In addition to Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s process is a direct attack on university and truth search freedom, essential by all democratic societies.
Denies the right to cite credible sources and make a debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that disagree with the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under penalty of many persecutions, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, I could do it according to the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
He has a right to answer.
The university world, to which we belong, knows for a long time to manage debates and disagreements and solve conflicts.
The unmeasured persecution of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what he intends, he does not want to make a transparent debate.
It’s a loss for the university world, but also for public debate in Canada, and it’s time for governments to place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and Congress leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement on yesterday’s most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
The new version of the US $700 billion plan that aims to stop the financial crisis that has stripped Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Chambers of Congress.
It particularly provides for better control by the elected of their implementation, of new mechanisms aiming to ensure the refund of invested public money, of the new provisions to contain the number of houses embarked on the lack of payment, as well as a right to control the salaries paid to the leaders of the supported companies.
American Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative at the negotiation table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a negotiation marathon lasted two days.
"We have made great progress with a view to an agreement that will be effective in the markets," Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
"Everything has been done to cover the economy and ordinary Americans before the current crisis in Wall Street," the Democrat said.
“It’s the fundamental point: if we don’t do this, the trauma, chaos, and disturbances on Americans’ daily lives will be immense,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they were afraid of the effect that would cause a new failure on investors' mood.
The last hour was the opening of markets this morning.
The two candidates in the U.S. presidential elections, who have late joined the negotiations, showed themselves rather favorable to the deal, not forgetting yet to express their dissatisfaction of being forced to reach this extremity.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama gave him certain provisions to achieve the agreement, particularly that would enable owners to preserve their home and on the wage of the leaders of the surviving companies by the state.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, we must not congratulate themselves.
But these measures are necessary,” he said on American television.
His Republican opponent John McCain, asked in another chain to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote."
"The important points I read [show] that it is something we will have to digest and with which we will be able to advance.
He said the option of not doing anything is not acceptable.”
The 700 billion plan aims to purchase with taxpayers’ money doubtful debts, risk-to-risk and unselling assets from the U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the outbreak of a real estate bubble that first led to the sinking of risk mortgage credits before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and causing a liquidity frost and a dismantling of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of Republican elects who had changed the first agreement project last week.
We believe we have left stagnation since Democrats agreed that certain “toxic” assets of difficulty companies are only insured by the government rather than purchased.
In order to relieve the grief for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that if the government had to assume losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would intend to help him regain money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which another 100 billion can be added if the president seems necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote from Congress.
Instead of his aid, Washington will get shares in the rescued companies that will be dividend in case of profit and that will be able to sell again when the storm is passed.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay embargo procedures concerning housing obtained with real estate loans according to this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and metal compensation paid to the leaders of businesses affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see them submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives since today and the vote of the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all its efforts, it is still not sure that your plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest against this project yesterday, both from Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Chamber’s Finance Commission, told his voters that “with all evidence Washington does not want to understand.”
“We have a very serious financial problem.
There are a few solutions.
But not what is to take advantage of taxpayers.”
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is encouraging a small group in Congress, presents the problems otherwise, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred economy teachers, among whom three Nobel Prizes, wrote to tell us: We ask Congress not to hurry and carefully examine the path to be taken,” he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we again had the test of the world nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for €11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced he resigned to buying his failure competitor since she lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) during the crisis of risk-risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
“This is not lost money,” said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
Instead, we recover a voting right at the bank and influence.
It’s just something that the savings and families will appreciate now that times are uncertain.”
During this time, on the other side of the Mancha, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all lending loans at the Bradford and Bringley bank and more than €41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it was the one who would buy the British bank’s branches and bank accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
Had the American actor with a charming smile released from his narcissist side?
Yes and no.
His pudding, sensitivity, and a talent that was obvious will also have removed him from the record of power that the true sacred monsters have.
But what a big background runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday, 83, due to lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the latest icons of American films of fast years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, who looked much and was for a long time considered a rival in the cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic conventions.
Mixed bloods often make magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin.
Of these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No unmeasured ego, the latest brand of quality.
Because there was projected an entire country in love with self-made man, the fighter of the Pacific War, injured in combat, who in the early 50s studied dramatic art in Yale, then frequented the New York Actor's Studio, before succeeding in theatre, television and soon in the cinema.
This man who milited for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked in second position in Le Mans 24 hours in 1979, folded by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star, allergic to the scandals of the show world that we do not know very well, also disappear with him.
He is an honorable man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s death triggered filmmakers this weekend, while their big roles are cracked down on the black screen of memories.
More than a half a century of seventh American art in perpetual movement parade through it.
Many memories come back to memory as the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on Tennessee Williams' adapted zinc roof in 1958.
More close to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have passed into the history of cinema.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role designed to James Dean, repeated after his death, who truly launched Newman in 1956.
This friendly mangan in the sunny movie The Sting (The Goal), Oscar for the best movie in 1973.
Bitter and Avenger billiard player in the magnificent film The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961), will repeat the character in The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, who won him his only Oscar among nine nominations in 1987.
This face that changes over the years was him.
Still him.
Seasons change during their career.
Young people know it primarily thanks to Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With a latest role of Irish mafia parent in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003, the rice was cracked.
Contrary to several movie legends that quit soon left the race, Newman stayed a lot in the cinema world, denounced Hollywood, his gold, his fasts and his concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, with humour, "a challenge living in " underplaying " and judging his benefits too supported.
The profession wasn’t always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers arrived for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of young galan than marginal: neurotics, alcoholics, hooks or desperate, whose traits reflected rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed on the sides his true unknown pudical sensitivity.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott because of overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of pureness and sadness.
"Among the numerous tributes that triggered yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former arms companion Robert Redford (have worked together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: "My life and my country were better thanks to their existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important features of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legend career, a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent film, is also hidden against Hollywood excesses.
We’ve seen his face reign over vinagreta sauce boats, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of poor taste, although it began as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to its Childhood Foundation in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than satisfying his myth, has committed himself to the end.
Left her five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of an American artist so lucid and so generous.
In short, a model citizen.
What did they produce at the Zuschlag &amp; Co. bill factory?
Very soon, on October 8, the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his complices will be initiated.
Politicians and their partners are accused of committing fraud of significant harm, in a business way, continuously and organized in addition to other offences, including the counterfeiting of documents.
According to the Prosecutor, the funds obtained in public tenders used for their own purposes, often justifying the fulfilment of tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and the funds of the municipalities - in total about 65 million HUF - stopped in part in the treasury of the Fiatal Balondal organization and in part in the pocket of individuals.
The method, which was also announced by the investigators, was to justify the collection of the funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the different associations never fulfilled their assumed obligations.
According to the accusation, most invoices were false.
For this purpose, the stainers were obtained in the Jozsefváros District market and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that on behalf of which company the counterfeit invoice was decided among others on that tour by the Upper Balaton Region where János Zusatz sent to István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for invoice for his consumption and they served as a model to make the invoices they presented among others in the contests of the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as the City Council of the Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by István Lados and his partner András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who according to our information rather wrote the reports needed to obtain public grants.
During one of his “study journeys” Lados chose a beerhouse.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and its complices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the center manager - so many people don't fit at the same time in that place.
Likewise, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövőert Foundation - later called Egüütt to Harmadik Évezredért - was filled with formal and contextual errors.
Because a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people couldn’t stay there in one night, however on the bill there were one hundred and thirty people.
But great fantasy invoice manufacturers also exaggerated when they pointed out to the Pigal Kft gastronomic center, because in the books of it - according to the information given to the prosecutor - there were no documents on behalf of Jobb Jövőert and Hoppa.
Győző Farkas, the manager of that company, told hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the prosecutor and showed the bills, he knew it was false documents.
"In the stamp the name of our company and the NIF appeared instead of incorrect."
He added: In addition to the formal problems, he didn’t agree that according to the bill there were 100 people accommodation, since they have only eleven rooms in which so many people don’t fit.
In addition, the invoice also included meals, while the restaurant has long not worked.
The enthusiasts of invoice manufacturers were also not reported that the travel agency chosen in Budapest organized exclusively abroad trips, so in the cash invoice stupidly indicated as a service a trip within Hungary, which did not coincide with the agency’s invoice delivery practice.
Furthermore, as it was known during the investigation, VAT also included in the document, although travels outside the European Union were tax-free.
Among other things, the measure of VAT was also incorrect in the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the foundation Job Jövőert, since the services of that company are not charged with a 25 but only with 15% of VAT, as well as the hotel employees only extended machine-made bills without the manual invoice.
Furthermore, the "expedients" made other mistakes also, such as in the case of a company in which they put on the invoice as activity carried out road transport to which - it was known during the prosecution's investigations - the company founded as an investment consultant does not perform.
Also due to formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false seal - it was known that the invoices issued to Egypt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, XXI.
Like in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to have issued those invoices.
The counterfeiters also paid attention to the fact that when the Fiatal Varosért Egyesület group ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in settlement process, so the settlement--according to our information-denied having issued such a document.
Consciously expired the bills
Another group of fake invoices manufacturers are made up of those who were aware that they were to issue fictional invoices.
The Esély Budapestert Alapítvány Foundation, on the request of Fiatal Balodal - Ifjú Szocialistak, issued invoice for about four million HUF on behalf of the Egyutt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of the Collab Kft. - according to the accusation - convinced him one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictional invoices.
Also collaborated with Zuschlag and its partners with the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, which in 2003 supplied invoices for approximately five million HUF to the Jobb Jövőrt Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the real activity Vöörösfenyős Association.
There was no capital movement either, as they then annulled the prepared invoices but forgot to write to this entity in their documents.
The next group of fake bills manufacturers include those who have some ties with the accused.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the lawyer of the Ukrainian manager of the fictional-based Delta Trio SL in Budapest, who was dealing with fuel and vehicle trade.
The company issued numerous invoices for an approximately 18 million HUF in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to investigation data, these invoices were purchased by the Kiskunhalas Cash Investment Kft., which has been under settlement process since September 14, 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also sent the company-related documents between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov recognized during the investigation that he issued on behalf of the company invoices for the Atlasz, Hoppa and for Egyutt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány charged the amount himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian albañiles at Ivan Kubatov's express request.
However, none of the companies actually worked due - according to the accused - to that they received no work.
But it took advantage of these companies, since at the request of their partner, attorney Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company’s registration documents, shipped invoices on behalf of the companies for the organisations linked to Zusatz: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generation.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities for HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor considered Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of the bills.
This man even took advantage of the commandite Szi-Beri society to issue fictional invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generáció and Szövetség to Modern Magyaroszágért presented a contest in January 2006 to Tancsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
The contest gained 500 thousand HUF respectively, but did not use the money for the contest goals.
In order for this not to be discovered, they submitted to the TMA five fictional invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These were the bills found during the registration of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Part of the accused will probably report in trial - as they did in the prosecution - the course of counterfeiting invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the principal accused János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions have not been very detailed so far, and although he repeatedly promised to speak of everything, this has not done so far.
The question is, what interest do you do?, because perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists reached an agreement with it for Zusi to assume all responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, could even be offended for these days, since in order to alleviate his prison conditions requested home arrest, but was denied him repeatedly.
While the numerous authors of economic crimes of much higher value, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait for the sentence in their own home, he has no chance for that.
Psychology of overlappings: Why do we spend more money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York discovered the neurological - economic foundations of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to the study published in the Science magazine, people don’t want to lose competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" through experimental auctions.
One of the groups of volunteers played lottery, the other participated in an auction and while examined by the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI) the active brain zones of the individuals participating in the experiment.
In both games, participants could make money, but during auctions, where it is essential to bet more than the other, by losing the game intensified the functioning of the complex called stratum located under the brain cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of the nervous system’s “self prize”.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention so as not to cause an intense strate reaction.
To found their theory, the scientific group economists also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment, three groups bet against a person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its members bet.
In addition to that, another group was promised that if they win, they would receive $15 more prize.
Instead, the third group received exactly $15 prior to the auction, but in the event of losing the auction, the group members lost even that money.
Thus the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure was highlighted.
However, checking the hypothesis of neurologists, members of the group playing “counter failure” were willing to bet even more than members of the control group and the “winning group”.
“These results cannot be deducted from any previously existing economic theory.
For those so far explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped solve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now reach a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at the University of New York Economics Faculty.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
Some 500 million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated because many of the sick do not know they are infected.
The denomination of hepatitis is the common name of different liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms look a lot; they are characteristic of liver infection and ictericy, but their pathogens and caused diseases are very different.
Hepatitis viruses depending on the pathogen are spread by two main forms: hepatitis A and E by food (e.g. with water or infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body mood (sperma, vagina mood, saliva).
It is recommended for travelers to protect themselves against A and B virus vaccine, there are no vaccines.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consuming the infected food, manifested by a general condition of illness, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that it appears on the skin and in the eyes’ white, the excrement becomes clear, dark urine and healing can last even two - three weeks.
Annually a million people die in the world of cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that, according to calculations, only one in ten infected receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can cause liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most of the infected do not know that he is ill because this pathological agent gradually destroys the liver cells and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Premature recognition, systematic medical control is therefore very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug consumers and tattooers.
There are currently about 200 million people worldwide suffering from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with routine laboratory control as well, it is worth consulting the family doctor when experiencing some unknown symptoms.
The disease is healed if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so it can suppress contagion and prevent cancer.
September 30th is the World Hepatitis Day, which was organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representatives of the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by the viruses and the importance of their premature recognition.
Does it hurt less to whom they believe in God?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith has a soothing effect that also alleviates the death of Catholicism martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in how it influences human pain, the British newspaper Telegraph reported.
In the framework of this unique experiment, they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists, while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the scanning technique of the human brain, it was able to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
This experiment is the first in the series of research in which alongside academics also participate scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University.
The analysis occurred as follows; they fixed a sparkling instrument on the left hand of the patient, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to set their eyes into two paintings; to the Virgin Mary, the work of Sassoferrato of the 17th century and the Lady of the 15th century Armigno of Leonardo da Vinci.
The researchers had the hope that the show of the Virgin Mary would cause a certain religious mood among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo’s oil because it was not too different from the other, and thought it had a reassuring effect.
Patients spent half an hour in one MRI scanner, receiving 20 electric shocks in four successive parts during that period while watching religious theme painting or the other.
The Catholics claimed that when looking at the Virgin Mary they felt in "security" as "protected" people, "reassured themselves and in her heart reigned peace."
When they looked at the painting of religious theme, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo’s work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any such shocking image you can achieve a similar effect with atheists as well, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person they feel very positively for, like a mother or father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the result of the investigation.
“The exercise of faith should and in many cases really changes our personality,” Wright added.
After these formidable results, there is only one question: What effect would it have for pain regulation if the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of his size was shown to the faithful?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary give even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On his tenth birthday, Google can affirm: he can be found both in the people’s pocket, as in the sky above his head; he knows where they spent their holidays, which doctors visit and what they’re interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s executives, this is not yet enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel with orwelian vision do not see the essence of the Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently declared to the Financial Times newspaper that Google’s primary goal is to gather as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary to reach the original goals of Google’s founders: “We gather in one system all the information in the world!”
According to Google’s leader, the company even after ten years of work that returned the world is still in the early stage of the effort to be able to treat all the information.
To the question what’s going to happen within five years Schmidt answered: “I would like Google to answer questions like ‘What to do tomorrow?’ or ‘What would be the job that would best suit me?’ – however, the software will not be able to answer apparently so simple questions until there are enough user information.
Not all users are aware that during their browsing on the Network the searched keywords, IP addresses, and pages where they passed when they finished the search are accurately stored.
Thanks, for example, to Personalized Search that you debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, check out what they were looking for before, which they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - in this same logic will be based on Recommendations, on which the system will offer us products and services based on the preferences above defined and stored.
What will happen if they take advantage of my data against me, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are concerned about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that they not only retain, but in justificable cases also give all the sought-after expressions to third parties, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of the Internet users.
The most discussed example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google gave the Brazilian government the information from their web page, named Orkut, to identify pedophiles.
Instead, internet users concerned about the rights of people were relieved in May when the company along with the FBI, an organization for the defence of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated before the court that he was right in his litigation with the FBI: According to the sentence, Google cannot be obliged, by any points of the constitution to provide any kind of secret information requested.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to get the pretext of strengthening the child protection law approved years ago, about fifty thousand web addresses and about a thousand sentences searched, but without getting the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
This is quite contradictory opinion about Google: those who fear to provide their personal data are criticizing it because they think their privacy, their private life are harmful when they start using Google’s services, and rebell against it as against multinational conservative image companies.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its enthusiasts followers, users and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "avant-garde corporation", not so to its rival, the Microsoft, catalogued for its Windows as a conqueror of the World, so much that both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code or money for their applications, the source is open and the free program package is constantly updated and seems younger, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it may also be because the geek sees accurately the very problematic relationship between people’s rights and the Internet that occurred just by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: the Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while measurements of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: show ourselves.
A normal young man may have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and may even join them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers a list of his music customs, then they may include in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, may also have a blog, where the most recent photo galleries are automatically displayed on the Flick.
We can know many cases that, for example, the girlfriend, seeing the flow of photographs of the morning of common friends, finds out who spent the night before his fraudulent boyfriend or can fire a company employee because he writes his sincere opinion on his blog about the company’s address: one thing is safe, the definition of private life has been completely revalued.
A person's "on-line" life is what she shows of herself - this is the definition that hides behind the behavior of the youth of today.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least intends to avoid Google’s monopoly, can do so (starting for example with the Scroogle that uses Google’s search system but doesn’t leave footprints).
There are many people who don’t want to register on collective pages to prevent them from finding them, but they can replace Google’s “on-line” applications, from text writing software to image and reading news applications with alternative versions that do not connect to giant servers or prepare the most perfect possible profile about us.
Public opinion expects almost openly the day when Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten advertising agencies’ revenues, while services that are introduced increasingly cause severe headaches to other Microsoft companies, not only.
Critical observers, however, will find the alarming contradictions as well: for example, the top management robustly rejected the protest of employees after duplicating the price of the company’s childcare, considered too expensive the unlimited number of Chinese feeding of employees, but this is nothing compared to the fact that the Google dealt to the pressure of the Chinese.
One of the internal regulations of the company says they will not announce any new service in advance, but only when it is already ready to work, which if it is sure is that the predictable problems of the coming months and years will be able to revolt the world: while some believe that the health care scanning and archive project has our own, because our previous books and magazines will acquire such dimensions that our company will soonly be cited by the United States’s.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, it will be able to provide good raw material for writers of science fiction works, Scroogled, a novel from Cory Doctorow’s popular, describes in orwelian form that future, in which a man only from Google’s data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped erase the footprints of the dual murder in the city of Ozd.
Police interrogated two minors about the double murder of Ózd who, suspected, helped erase the footprints of the crime, spokesman of the General Office of Public Order of Borsod Province said on Tuesday.
The young women recognized the crime they were accused, and they are currently accused of crime faults.
The two minors – according to the Hungarian News Agency’s information – are about two girls – will be able to defend themselves freely.
Because of complicity, they can receive up to five years in prison.
The accused of double murder of Ozd - a 23-year-old man - is in preventive detention since Sunday.
He is accused of the crime of killing several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a great sum to a 53-year-old man.
The accused did not want to pay his debt, so last Wednesday he quoted his creditor to the headquarters of an Ozd company, where he killed him and then also killed the nine-year-old daughter of the victim.
According to the MTI, the young man prepared himself long earlier to commit the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden in the place of the crime.
Police with an expert analyze the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange submitted an offer to purchase the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros — about five billion Czech crowns — for the 100 percent of the stocks of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer the Poles made, despite the fact that the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state that within a few months wants to sell 60% of the shares.
Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the Polish offer has been the highest of those offered by stakeholders for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Nasdaq Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse offered.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among the stakeholders the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that in the future the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
Experts calculate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholder agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.

About the financial crisis from the perspective of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the increasingly deep international financial crisis talk about a "second September 11".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the U.S. President - the Republic of Rome - the president has not even been able to obtain the support of his own party for the bill done hurryly, whose goal is to give a solution to this desperate situation.
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", about which the multibillionary investor Warren Buffett spoke, it is more correct to talk about a "second September 11".
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the expiation goat.
The mistake of the U.S. political leadership was the one that led the world economy to the edge of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. monetary system is increasing and this will then impact the entire world.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, after the congress’s vote, the danger arises that Washington doesn’t offer any political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air – just when one of the greatest transformations in capitalism’s history takes place.
You cannot ignore this threat - points the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still throw life-belt to the struggling financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayers’ money.
But if the domino even more banks fall down, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will no longer be enough.
It is necessary for member states of the European Union to leave their nationalist selfishness aside and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
The financial institutions in crisis received only more than 100 billion euros on Monday - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that the concerns are increasingly real that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has not so far seriously dealt with the crisis that passes as a cuminate by the Old Continent.
The "saviors" will not immediately have to submit hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they were defined: in what cases taxpayers' funds are justified to avoid greater evil?
Intelligent Car Mimics Bee Flight
What would be the best method for developing technologies in order to avoid collision, if not the imitation of the barrier sensors existing in nature?
For example, the bees.
In a surprising project presented at the Japanese CEATEC, the bees gave the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the BR23C imitator-type car robotic management system, which gave the characteristics of the bees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can avoid all collisions.
During the flight, each beer creates its own particular oval space that really resembles a lot to our protective safety capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technology director of RP and development and research.
They play an important role the composite eyes of bees that are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composite eyes, the engineers used the laser-ray length measuring system.
This identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle microprocessor that immediately becomes a manoeuvre to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds, the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle robot imitating the movements of the bees, modifying the direction by rotating the wheels to the extent necessary.
Unlike any existing system today, this maneuver is completely instinctive.
“If not, the vehicle robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot’s project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety protective capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a beer makes to avoid other beers.
This process must be carried out in one opening and closing the eyes.
However, unlike the bees, the movement cannot be directed up, down or diagonal, but can only be bidimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities for bees to escape other bees, here they only used as a possibility for the car robot the rotary movement and acceleration additionally the braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and its energy density is greater, meaning they have a longer lifetime than that of lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the data processing capacity, not much less the storage capacity.
This apparatus in each second should only process some input signals and react according to the case.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on data from the above manoeuvres, so it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
No memories of gigabytes or megabytes are needed.
This is the first step to develop technology to immediately avoid obstacles, which, according to Nissan’s calculations, can be incorporated into series-made models within ten years.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to its destination, avoiding the existing obstacles on its way.
He has already named this dear child
The written version of the $700 billion financial rescue package law, which will be applied in several phases, has been prepared in order to purchase bad credits from banks.
In the first phase, half of the money will be spent.
According to schedules on the eastern coast during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congress leaders reached an agreement about the $700 billion financial rescue package in total, after several days of discussion, Reuters said.
We have achieved significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the North American Congress, saying that the agreement in a document has only been formalised.
The commitment on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, talking about the outcome of the commitment said: this program will work and will be efficient but further measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving the Wall Street, but to turn back the economy car.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, that is, Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington’s schedule (i.e. before 2 p.m., according to Central Europe’s schedule), without causing a spectacular jump on the bags.
On the bill called the 2008 Emergency Law for Economic Stabilization, Monday will first vote the North American Congress and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news on the deal.
We are happy with the progress made overnight and highly appreciate both parties’ efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” said Tony Fratto, White House spokesman.
The program is different from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend all $700 billion to buy securities of poor quality credit funds.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using 250 billion immediately after the Congress votes, probably Monday, from this sum the Ministry of Finance will buy securities of credit funds, poor ratings and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president’s decision.
This program will be controlled by a special body, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion can be spent after a new Congress decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously purchase bad credits, mortgages and credit fund securities, and other "poisonous" type credits as well.
The purchase may be done either directly or in auctions - competent persons reported from the ministry.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program where the finance portfolio guarantees the concerning elements, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the predictable damage.
Henry Paulson said: “The law thus ensures the necessary financial means, which can even reach $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, treat the purchase of bad financial means, its insurance or risk prevention that could lead to the breakdown of some major financial institutions.”
We do everything we need to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it, he added.
Instead, the heads of banks that are in trouble and expect state aid will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensation, which the American argot simply calls gold parachutes.
Only in certain cases payments will be limited, as well as limitations depend on the form of aid of the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry purchases within the framework of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on gold parachutes, unless the failed chief of the bank is retired.
By purchasing bad credits directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the compensation of the bosses is not exceeded.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations refer only to new contracts to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in U.S. history that a legal limitation to the revenues of the general directors will be in effect - said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Congress commission, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares from the banks participating in the programme, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they will ultimately even be able to earn profits with the transaction as soon as the economy is recovered and the bank with it.
According to the bill over the next five years, the president must submit a proposal to Congress on how to return taxpayers the losses of the financial sector.
Of course, on both sides there were people who expressed their reservations regarding the project.
This is not what American citizens ordered us, i.e. the dollars of taxpayers are not protecting themselves,” said California’s Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, said: the measures urged him the same who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to increase
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 percent compared to last month prices and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007 prices - the Central Statistics Office (KSH) reported.
Industrial export prices rose by 1.1 percent compared to July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 percent compared to previous year.
And as a result of changes in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 percent compared to the previous month and by 3.2 percent compared to the previous year.
Industrial sales prices increased only in a minimum measure, with 0.1 percent.
Domestic sales prices in the processing sectors increased minimally, with 0.1 percent over the month of July.
The highest price increase occurred in August 2008, in the leather and footwear production sector (2.8 percent), primarily due to the increase of 4.6 percent monthly bags and belts and the increase of 2.5 percent of footwear.
The highest price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical production branch (1.6%).
Price decreased in the petrochemical sector, (1.4 percent), in the production of electrical machines and instruments (0.9 percent), as well as - to a small extent - in the wood processing sectors (0.1 percent).
They did not change the prices of paper manufacturing, editorials and printers.
In the other sectors of the processing industry, prices increased between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water that represent a significant weight within domestic trade, an increase of 0.3 percent was recorded in August, firstly as a result of the rise in official prices from July 1.
In a comparison of a twelve-month period - in domestic sales in the processing industry sectors - the highest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4%).
In the metal manufacturing sector there was an increase of 13.2 per cent, while in the food, beverage and tobacco industry, there was an increase of 11 per cent.
Price decreased in the textile industry (2.5%), as well as in the manufacturing of electrical machines and instruments (0.3%).
In the rest of the processing sectors, price growth rate was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
During the year in the processing industry globally increased prices by 10.2 percent.
Prices of electricity, gas, heat and water supply exceeded 18.7 percent of the previous year’s prices.
In August, among the different domestic trade sectors, the largest monthly price increase (0.7 percent) was recorded in the investment goods sectors.
In the consumer products sectors, prices increased by 0.3 percent, energy and intermediary sector prices did not change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, with respect to the same month of the previous year, the highest price increase occurred in the energy sectors and in the intermediate industry (16.8 percent).
In consumer goods producing branches, a 6.8 percent decrease was recorded and in investment goods 1.4 percent.
Industry export prices calculated at HUF increased 1.1 percent compared to the previous month, and compared to 12 months, there was a 3.9 percent decrease.
The quote of our national currency in a month reduced with 1.7 percent over the euro and 7.1 percent over the dollar, compared to August 2007 strengthened with 7.5 percent over the euro and 15.9 percent over the dollar.
Will next year no longer be needed a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes there are many possibilities for the American-Hungarian agreement on the exemption of visas to come into force around January 12 – the Foreign Minister spoke of this in Chicago, before the Hungarians resident there.
In his opinion, “almost everything depends on the time that the electronic system of access and control is constructed on the other side of the Atlantic.”
At the same time he warned that the new system will disappear, but tourists must register before they leave the country of origin.
As of today, the chief of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will be interviewed with the Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to give him the Median Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and will hold negotiations with the international policy advisors of presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favour of banks’ financial rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties on Sunday assured their support for the administration’s $700 million banking aid program, instead, there are politicians demanding the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
Representatives of Congress and administration, after several days of marathon-type negotiations, announced Sunday morning: a principle agreement was reached on the banks’ financial rescue package.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and defrosting the frozen credit market became the central topic of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to prove they are more able than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, by putting economic issues at the forefront, Obama again gained some advantage and disappeared McCain’s advantage he had obtained after the Republicans’ convention with Sarah Palin’s candidate to Vice-President.
In a Detroit campaign mine last Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly pass the $700 billion package law.
He stressed that the proposal includes those points of consumer protection, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and with responsibility (...) employment, savings of you are endangered in addition to entire industries and the stability of the entire economy," he said in a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not miss the opportunity to qualify McCain’s economic concepts as obsolete.
In an interview awarded to ABC McCain, he explained that “we will all swallow this toughly . . . but not doing anything is simply not a viable path.”
The Republican Senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a control commission to the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the compensation of executives, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama declared to the CBS that McCain did not play any important role in the consultations, instead he consulted with the minister daily.
Congress President Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that congressmen will probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Press Magazine of the German Speaking Area
The right group is intact, only within the group itself the most conscious voters became – says the Der Spiegel about the weak CSU electoral outcome in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red coalition.
The Mirror (Spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left-wing magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours their parents" discusses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known politician, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber had taken over his position.
Social-Christians for several decades were developing to Bavaria - and now just these modern citizens are the ones who turn their back.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that was predicted for almost ten years was completed: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU obtained 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is still during the Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists already 40 years ago have been predicting this, but at the pace they were very wrong, however, the secularization, the results of the education and settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization also increases the possibilities and it also has political consequences.
The right group is intact, only within the group itself became the most conscious, more critical, and more testified voters.
It is surprising that in the past few weeks the conventional groups of citizens were those who went farther away from the CSU; self-employed, small industrialists, bachelors and diplomats.
Thus, less than 40 percent of support for the CSU was refused.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The Vienna conservative newspaper: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "The Presidents of the Party are very reserved in coalition issues" - it deals with the confusing situation of domestic policy after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from being involved in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is shown open in all directions to negotiate, but the greens instead do not want to consult on the coalition.
The elections have already been held, now everything turns around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the leaders of the parties barely let them see something of their boxes.
Werner Faymann, President of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties is possible - it already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left up the question that if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, in the position of vice-chancellor.
He claimed that in any case the era of Schüssel-Molterer was disapproved.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer cautiously reacted to red offerings.
He said cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to engage in ÖVP’s internal affairs.
It is still open in the party if they choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must be discussed without a doubt, within the ÖVP itself.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black coalition, we are willing to take responsibility for the government," Haider said.
Jároka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equality of Opportunities began in Paris, its host is France that this year is also the European Union's turnover president.
In his message directed to the full, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, Livia Járóka raised attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that beat the Children and is also the greatest obstacle to the prevailing foundation of their interests.
This high-level conference was inaugurated – on behalf of the French presidency – by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for jobs, social affairs and equal opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights protection organizations attended the meeting.
Jároka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group of members of the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, the Citizens are outside the labour market first because of their low level of education.
“Most of the young Citizens have not finished middle teaching and due to the poor quality of basic teaching, only a small portion can obtain a university diploma.”
Jároka further emphasized that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevailing foundation of other human rights as well.
Investing in the teaching of young Children can strengthen the economy of member states of the European Union.
According to the European Parliament, these issues must be widely aware of both the Citizens and the non-Citizens.
Because the earlier the school begins a Roman student, the more chance to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumer taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"As citizens of the European Union, the Citizens must ensure the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education."
According to the European Parliament, the objective and active unit of the European Union is needed to immediately accelerate school desegregation processes, which is of fundamental importance for the proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
“The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and the possibility that democratic space guarantees is to be able to contribute to the future of Europe as full-right citizens,” Jaroka said.
The aim of the European Summit for Equality of Opportunities organized annually since the Berlin meeting last year held at the sign of the "European Year of Equality of Opportunities" is to ensure a singular forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equality at European and national levels of Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October, a decision will be made about the luck of the failed duo Huber-Beckstein
Despite the serious electoral defeat, the heads have not yet been cut at the tops of the Bavarian CSU, but the debate on personal issues has now been postponed.
Erwin Huber, president of the party and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still remain at their positions, but it is not known until when the grace will last.
The luck of the duo, who suffered a catastrophic electoral defeat of 17 percent, will be decided at the extraordinary congress of the party to be held last weekend of October.
The members of the so criticised duo let them interview: they don’t hold so much on their positions.
They intended to reassure the furious members of their parliamentary group and their basic organization, who one day after the Bavarian tsunami demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under Edmund Stoiber's leadership at the top of his career - the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent, instead now, a year after the attested coup against Stoiber, they reached only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria, which gives 18 percent of the German PBI.
Although in the Southern province, of key importance for the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to predominate, in the future they will certainly have to make coalition with someone.
As a first sign of the party’s restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, federal agriculture minister, one of Huber’s potential successors, also has a position in the small intelligence group that begins negotiations with the liberal FDP and with the Free Right Electors on a possible governmental coalition in Munich.
The strange thing of the destiny is that on the list of the Free Electors enters Parliament Gabriele Pauli, whose acting against Stoiber was taken advantage of the Huber-Beckstein duo and then cruelly erased from the stage to the ambitious local political.
The CSU’s top leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition, he will also receive an active role Stoiber that until now was moving the ropes in the background, the former provincial chief and former president of the CSU called the bitterest day of his political career on September 28.
On Monday, Huber made some critical observations to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the brother’s party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and Angela Merkel itself as well.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will not be a Chancellor if they are unable to enhance together the CSU who played a significant role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel that heavily could hide his disappointment for the failure, the losses of the CSU will not impact negatively on the great Berlin coalition.
What is naturally relative: it will not be easier to treat the injured CSU and the crisis of social-democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst outcome since 1946 in Bavaria.
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0
After the Sunday elections, there will be no opposition members in the Belarus parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability guaranteed in the country Alexandr Lukashenko, instead according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is rather explained by the violations of the law committed during the vote count.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral outcome.
While the country's 10 million-inhabitants legislature, integrated by 100 and 10 deputies, has more than a decade ago no opposition, before yesterday's elections, the united opposition under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed its mandate after the 2006 elections of doubt legitimacy, due to this modification.
Thus the ODSZ suppressed the boycott that he originally wanted to do.
In the bottom of the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which took a credit to moderate the import of increasingly expensive natural gas from Russia and contributed to the sale to Russia of Beltransgaz, owner of the high-level gas pipeline that passes through the country - wanted to improve its relationships with the European Union and not given political permits.
It was a sign of distension when the OSCE, in evaluating the electoral campaign, placed emphasis rather on positive phenomena rather than errors - such as the ban on participating imposed on one-third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE primary report on Monday criticized even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the vote count.
With all of this, in the opposition’s view, there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released and Minsk is ready to a small confrontation with Moscow, deniing the recognition of the separation of South Osetia and Abhasia of Georgia, although Russia – with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state – already a month ago.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun," he told our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the 2006 presidential election opposition candidate, it is desirable to maintain this situation, although "the regime fears to allow even an opponent to enter that weightless parliament."
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations by seeing the results, rather attempts to bring voters to their message about the need to make economic reforms.
"This clearly causes us many problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties in front of its distribution, but even so I see that it is increasingly the ones that support change among the elderly as well," said Milinkevich, making allusion to the regime of Lukashenko, who believes its main result is the creation of social security, do not even the most retired.
Because of the country’s debt and the increased trade deficit, it’s only a matter of time to break down the social security that “seems to the silence of cemetery,” Milinkevich said.
Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, called democratic to the elections.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, declared to the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: “People do not believe in words but in facts,” so that the lack of opposition is nothing but the testimony of the maturity of Belarus voters.
Brunetta: "From now you get more breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the Chigi Palace History that they put automatic doors to control the entrance and exit of staff.
but since today it starts with this measure against who took up and then goes to the bar to drink a coffee at work hours.
This novelty has been presented today by Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and Secretary-General of the Council's Presidency, Mauro Masi.
“Automatic doors,” says Brunetta, “are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services.”
“A new season of responsibility and transparency is now opened.
This is reformism,” Brunetta said again.
With Palacio Chigi the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi “the choice of automatic doors is also important from the symbolic point of view.”
No resistance has been found by employees, the Secretary-General says: "It has been a shared change by workers and there has been collaboration from them."
In short, no more breakfast at work hours; no more coffee and midlunas.
Brunetta’s word, which suggests, smiling, “a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand.”
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
“In three months, the absence of public employees’ disease has been reduced by 50%, meaning 60,000 more people to work in a year.”
And it adds that it is necessary to make public administration more effective.
Italian, “which wages dynamics – the minister explains – have been double over the last 8-10 years compared to the private sector and well above the cup of inflation.”
For now, millions of public employees have joined to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhere to the petition supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service shows the numbers, the smallest labour absentism for disease causes - writes the association of consumers - the people of 'vague workers' is continuously increasing.
It is actually millions of the right and productive public administration employees in Italy who have joined themselves to declare war to the illegitimate rules of the decree.
In particular, the Tar answered the exclusion of aggregated economic treatments due to illness due to service; the extension of the timelines in which the medical control visits of the sick employee are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister.
Job accidents, Napolitan: "Crucial Prevention"
Each day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die, and 27 are permanently invalid.
By 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
It testifies the gravity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice the death of killings.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of work accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
“The concerning data broadcast by Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is,” says Giorgio Napolitano, President of the Republic, in the message sent to the president of Anmil, a national association mutilated and invalid for work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of the State expresses his “great appreciation for the constant associative effort towards prevention at workplace, protection of injured workers, assistance to victim families and awareness of public opinion.”
“It has been manifested, a ‘basta’, sincerely shared, faced with tragedies that, by its dimensions, arouse the cry of the media and the participation of the public opinion, instead, the daily reality proposes us dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics.”
Napolitan doesn’t hide that “there is without a doubt a resource problem: it’s decisive to invest in training and information.
Particular meaning takes the numerous initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness of young people who enter the world of work.
It is a duty to keep attention to the phenomenon alive, not to stop the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative rules.
The Chairman of the House, Gianfranco Fini, has emphasized “as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offenses each of us’ consciousness and imposes all institutions a determined endeavour to put an urgent end.”
"The data on work accidents appear to indicate a slightly positive walk, but this does not take away the number of white deaths to be equally impressive," Anmil Pietro Mercandelli said.
"We do not actually want this 'decline tendency' to be translated into less attention, because it is just when attention decreases that explodes the tragedy.
“We believe that overall too little is still done to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, at our discretion - Mercandelli has highlighted - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the school world."
"Serve a further effort," he added, "as it concerns the communication and awareness of the public opinion.
But it serves, above all, a greater sense of responsibility by the employers regarding a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the planned level of subsidiary guardianship for the victims of work" and the "assistance derivation to which the system is being directed in recent years".
“The goal is to restore the worker’s insurance guarantee,” he added, “because the luck of the accident has not to depend on the gift arranged by the legislator every time.”
Mp3 readers under accusation put hearing at risk
Listening to high-volume music for a long period using portable musical apparatus such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injuries.
The European Commission, which in a statement in Brussels cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission on the emerging and recently identified health risk (Csrseri), published today.
“Of this scientific opinion – it is read in the note – it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least five years, listen to music with portable musical apparatus weekly for more than an hour a day having the high-volume apparatus risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity.”
“I am concerned that such a high number of young people who often use portable musical apparatus and high-acoustic cell phones can unconsciously ruin their ears in irremediable manner,” said Meglena Kuneva.
“Of scientific evidence – follows responsibility Ue – emerges a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What counts is to raise awareness of consumers and deliver this public domain information.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and have the step with the new technology.”
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the wide use of portable musical apparatus and the increased number of young people exposed to noise that causes.
"Scientists - concludes the executive Ue - confirm that it is a cause of concern, and the European Commission will now examine along with member states and stakeholders what measures could eventually be taken to better protect children and teenagers from noise exposure from portable musical equipment and related equipment."
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical apparatus to 100 dB, but concern increases as the hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these damages from a lot by using solutions such as reducing levels and noise exposure time.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee Ue notes that users of portable musical apparatus are listening to high volume (but 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours a week exceed the current limit for maximum noise consented at the job.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a 5-year period.
It means that it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the UE.
Rome, Alemanno gives the Commission the way for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June accounts will be made.
This is the schedule set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Fututo of the Capital of Rome", which has been established this morning at its new headquarters behind the Caracalla Thermas.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will deliberate the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the board and the community council will evaluate analysis and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Piano for Rome with the "official ball" of the municipality and its intendent Gianni Alemanno.
“The Commission is absolutely independent and represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – it tends to emphasize Alemanno – it will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who politically decide, the board and the municipal council, can then be adopted.
There is no left position of roles, only the willingness to have a place to draw up a great project for Rome.
In March finished the jobs will disappear, because this experience must have a precise temporary end.
In June – announces the Intendent – we will present the strategic plan using the Commission’s work for the future of the capital of Rome.”
To whom the Commission accuses of uselessness, since its opinions are not binding, Alemanno answers: "Everything depends on the degree of work that the Commission will perform and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, your contribution will be essential.
Almost always the policy is crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that are revealed back.
We, on the contrary, want to look beyond and long-term, in a deeper prospective, working seriously to the development of Rome and its future.”
"This Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, it doesn't coast a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to participate and reason the best minds that the capital expresses."
For Alemanno, “we need to have a strategic design as a reference, neither closed nor immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic level jump, of which we have absolute need, thinking with unity spirit to their future.”
A future that, precisely the intendent of Rome" would not only be limited to the current community confines, but looks beyond" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of capital but "also considering the role Rome can and must develop as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama, the first anti-American president.
He wrote an American political note that he is interested in passing as independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and tube relationships (as it also gives private citizen today) with the enemy Islam.
The attacks on Obama increased as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a web: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big stone face: he believes he would win the highest position in the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!
They are actually attacks that don’t say much; they are clearly racial attacks and do not answer the voters’ question: Will they be a good president? And there are also polls; everyone says that Obama won and with a good advantage.
Also in this case, there is someone who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper in the southern United States has written an editorial: once in the cabin to vote we will know well to whom the American patriot will give his vote.
A side of American mentality covered up to the last.
“Tell whatever you want, we will think afterwards where to put the cross, whether about Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear, if they win Obama, we will leave America.
things never said before now, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasons, the winning weapon for the Democratics is George Bush.
They have asked 1,500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term? 89 percent has answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent her home hit on the ass.
In Iraq, there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to make their suitcases.
Likewise, Iraq for most has been the weak point of Bush.
Whoever takes the position of George W will have a huge duty to develop.
The economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in the newspapers it is time to cut. Many blame the Internet, "killer" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been appealed by PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
Although today, journalists are almost everyone pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly declared to feel less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated as once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition, the cuts in the room where writers work to perform the newspaper is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the interviewed journalists, if traditional journalism is not wanted to be substantially reduced as most audiences understand.
A clear but complex pessimism predominates today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that national journalism is following a wrong pathway.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against emission.
It’s not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
The biggest editorial houses open a gap on the Internet, for many views as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The “economic pressure” that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted they are embracing technology in the hope that “do something good” for journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is among who runs the newspapers – that is, the directors – and the journalists working for them.
56% of national executives are sure their journalists share the same values, while at local level the percentage lower to 23%.
For some, this has to do with the “safety of work.”
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in three years are 47% at national level.
For journalists it is 30%.
The "safe work" at the level of staff (our writers, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In an immense nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet employers often offer what they want and thus becomes a matter of "take or leave it".
Directors almost always receive good wages, while writers can earn up to $10,000 a month, but retirement and social insurance.
For holidays, reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, on their admission, "sick" followed throughout the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROMA, DANIEL COPPOLA REmains in FROTTAFERRATE
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the real estate Danilo Coppola who had requested to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated by bankruptcy in the field of investigation on the counter-pact on Unipol-Bnl climbing.
In the course of the arrest process at his office, last week, he has obtained the household release, transforming it into a mandatory residence to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate to travel the province’s city route to a capital room.
According to the court, these trips (which the pm has given the opposite vote) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuse him.
Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already been manifested a few days ago with the vote of the representatives’ camera against the $700 million salvation plan launched by the White House: a significant portion of Americans was, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than to save the economy.
The New York Times confirms us yesterday that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, always more divided between its old soul of the East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, above all in Central and South states.
The soul, in fact, that has become prepotent with the vote of who spoke at the beginning.
This barely cited is just an example of the mutations, of the great mutations, which the ongoing economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here.
Whether in the United States as in Europe for a long time, the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate they solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-update, the extraordinary reactivation, of the double category state-sovereignty in relation to a type of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking institutions – which would finance, if, strong financial relationships with the foreign, but above all, the balances of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
He who immediately creates a political problem for who governs it: that is, how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or they don’t have much to say: the crucial evidence is the European Union that as always divides between different interests and different state strategies does not reach to decide any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone is expected to intervene, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and, above all, fund grant: from the time you reach the cut is only the state possessing the economic resources and the mass of funding resources to remedy things.
They also possess the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market probably and no organization can ever have to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the state-nation is in perfect tune, with the greatest importance as long as the new development of the economy tends to attribute it to a very linked factor to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced to have entered the ever more sophisticated technology network, intangible technology, while we were convinced that global finance was already aimed at dominating the world, we realized that our future will instead have to account more and more with the unmaterial things such as water, crops and oil.
All things that, look, can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the earth but are equally united in absolute mode in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever finds himself as a sovereign has certainly many more letters about whom he is not, and whoever has the misery of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I came to the second newness that but presumed a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Policy and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, of inadequate economic species with many dark areas.
And together somewhat deeper and in a certain bothering sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of distantness, which tends to involve the entire leadership class of Western countries in a growing number.
It seems to progress more and more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of social elites so far in boom, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the understanding exception of the end, having done their own time and be more strange to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in little words, undergroundly feeds a branched but powerful movement of delegitimation of the leadership classes and traditional political structures, which are manifested in a "return" electoral or in the sudden changes in collective humors of these last times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the Great-democratic consense.
It is the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say any, always make more difficulty to understand and then to represent, what is taking shape from today is the deep strates of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and potentially stir.
In front of all this talking about a "mass rebellion" today is frankly exaggerated.
But having the eyes open certainly is not.
The super glue to walk over the walls
Victory laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walking over the walls like spider man.
It is the goal of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has approached quite.
With a only 2.5-inch square adhesive, scientists have been able to have a 100-kilogram body stick on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the discoveries of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is an evolution of existing ones using a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang at Atlanta Georgia Institute of Technology.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the gecos, coated with microscopic hair that can ensure the animal a perfect adhesion.
Tests made on different materials, such as glass, teflon and limestone paper, have demonstrated that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful from the legs of this reptile and at the same time "it's easily leaving from the walls," explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton Engineering.
-"This material could be useful as a transitory adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Covers to walk through the walls exactly like spider man? Covers yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use like the connection between electronics, because carbon nanotubes are heat and electrical current conductors.
Other applications may have to do with aerospace engineering.
For the moment no superheroes.
OTHER INVESTIGATION - Also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article from the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scholars have presented a microfiber-made adhesive such as hair that self-cleaning from dust during movement on a surface to maintain a perfect adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, especially consumed in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if they are taken contemporaryly with some drugs, their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing according to the case, efficiency with serious health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices are packaged as freshes associated with the assumption of some medical products David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway to Philadelphia sends a new alarm to patients: just a glass of pomegra, orange and apple juice to beased by the absortion of some drug drugs.
Grapefruit juice was already being accused because it was held responsible for increasing some anti-arythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistaminal, and neurological toxic levels.
The same Italian drug agency had reported in a newsletter two years ago alarming physicians and patients not to underestimate the danger derived from this mixture and to pay attention to a thing is drinking in the case a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone is being assumed.
NOT ONLY POMELO – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Here’s call by Michele Carruba, director of the State University of Milano’s pharmacology department: “These discoveries are generally noted to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the information notes thereof.
That’s why we must always read the illustrative brochures of the medications that are assumed and if there’s something that isn’t clear to us, don’t let us impress, clearly ask the doctor or pharmacist,” Ansa’s expert said.
The Economic Novel to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Economy Award has been awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies, trading models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a keynesian neo who teaches the University of Princeton and is a renowned publisher of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of Bush’s administration’s decisions on the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the attack on September 11, 2001, at those days Enron broke, Krugman had anticipated in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, ending consequently for the United States.
A forecast that triggers a lot of controversy and that for several years has been opposed to the economy, but that has now been revealed accurately.
“I’m surprised and a little bothered by how the memory of Enron and Worldcom’s collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Banking, Krugman is a “valuable economist,” but also a “very aggressive” style discloser, particularly critical against the excess liberalism of Bush’s administration.
Open Office, echo the third edition of the package"anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that seeks to attract more and more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After a nearly one year work from volunteer developers, whose backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several news: to the welcome screen and less rude magazine interface, other more consistent are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF(Open Document) Format 1.2.
Also placed on multi-function with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is in a degree of opening the documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interestingly, some specific features of some modules such as one that allows you to reduce the dimension of PowerPoint presentation, useful, for example, to send it via electronic post, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphic design module, retaining the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hybrid PDF documents", which accumulate the typical Adobe format graphics with the elements of a sheet or a text elaborator.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet can intervene in various users, avoiding conflicts of modifications, in the drafting of texts, each collaborator is given a colour in the comeback for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the final outcome.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English in the mirror since Friday.
In addition, for Windows and Mac OS, as usually the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent home or to work.
And if the theme of the free can be a hook for broadcasting in homes, it’s in business area that Open Office’s suite tests, trys the big bet, already counting on several projects carried out in public administration and schools.
And not even the realities offering an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, where business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for Word video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint presentation; Dbase, comes in the case of known Access is the program that allows to work on the base data; and ultimately Draw the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that so far we have reached nearly 3,6 billion, with the release of the new version is likely to exceed the expected figure.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping.
New positive case in the tour of France: it is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third ranked and winner of the best climber rem.
The news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive corridor to the third-generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also them from the Gerolsteiner.
Analyses of Kohl's blood champions are among those carried out in recent weeks in the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratory.
If the counter-evidence confirms that it is positive, the Austrian will lose the third position in the Tour and anger against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl’s positive doping to the third-generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has declared to the Associated Press to have notify the news to Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself in the podium behind the back of Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, awarding the rem of the best climber.
INMIGRANTES: NEW YORK TIMES QUESTIONS, ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy from a country of migrants has only recently become a privileged destination for migrants who are hostile.
This is what the New York Times is wondering in a long article that has dedicated to the debate on the theme of racism in Italy from the case of young Abdul William Guibre originating in Burkina Faso killed the previous month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case evidences what the New York Times defines the "northern paradox": Northern regions are at the same time those where they are registered "more integration and more work" but also the highest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the highest support in the Northern League.
As confirmed of the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
The new legislation desired by the Lega also presses the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestines is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The Pope said: “Giorgio Napolitano meets Benedict XVI in Congress has asked the state and the church to work together to fight racism.”
Students victims of expensive rental, up to 900 euros per room
The rent market for college students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest Sunia survey, the union of the tenants, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Napoles, 600 in Rome.
“The phenomenon has already taken very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people for the highest costs that the family would have to sustain,” explains Sunia’s study office manager Laura Mariani, “in these cities the strong demand has completely deformed the market at such a point of triggering a process of widespread to residents.”
Besides that in most cases rental offers contain a number of violations: free, unregistered, no canon limits contracts, linked sub rentals.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are needed that, through the review of the tax taxation, prices can be regulated.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve about 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) you are asked about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per single room) in areas near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
Economy is made only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros per bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and surrounding area.
In Naples for a bed you serve 300/450 euros, for a room is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinic areas, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari for a bed you serve 250/350 euros, at least 350 per single.
in the most girls cities the prices are lower in absolute ends, but it has a higher weight in the city economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of student and extra-community rentals is more common, a further anomaly is recorded: an increase of 25/30% of the canon to foreign students with respect to Italians.
Goodbye to old movie Paradise, cities cancel historical rooms
Historical cinema halls close by favouring the Multiplex.
“A city without cinema rooms in a blind city is like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore photographs effectively what is happening in large Italian urban centers and also in province cities.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, which, with the birth of large meticons in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of monkey rooms in central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory,"as if a friend died, a acquaintance with whom a piece of place and so much excitement was shared," observes the director of the new Paradiso film, the film that twenty years ago won the cousin Oscar and the great jury prize in Cannes, who counted the poetry of a province cinema and nostalgia.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of traders, speak clearly: over the past five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and most of them to pay are above all the rooms in major cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most suffered by the closures are the first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas less, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the responsible for its disappearance is the adventure of the multiplex, these three Italian regions that have registered the largest number of new films: 195 more screens in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 is in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has developed irrationally,” observes Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, would be useful for new structures to be built, but it would be necessary to ensure the remain of those already existing, because when a city room closes, not all its frequentators are willing to transfer to the meticons.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favour of traders: the state’s earlier debt is approximately €10 million.
It is shameful from the ethical and moral perspective that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To support the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year.”
Interesting in the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that concerned the closures, decided to be repaired with the signature of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to promote and guard the cinema mono room is in the historic center that is on the periphery.
Among the foreseen rules there are mediated tax facilitation in favour of managers and advantages for the public at the end of mobility: viewers can enter the limited traffic zone and have special parking fees.
“It’s an initiative that I like,” observes Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting other measures on foot.
It is true, that to contrast the extra power of the meticons, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that was always important to me: the closure of Bagheria’s cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to perform the “New Paradise cinema”, which I thought for 10 years.
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I go ahead to the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, to not see the posters blacked by the dust, I turn to the other side.”
The link between politics and andrangheta has been arrested Mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniformize the municipality's elections for those interested in the Piromalli cosca."
The accusations are heavy that the judges of the Antimafia Directorate of Calabria give Goia Tauro and Vice-Intendent Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for mafia association.
Arrested also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elder mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, the boss' name, already convicted for mafia criminal association and to compensate for 10 million euros.
“Deprivating any legal and moral rules of good sense,” the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay consultations with the attorney Piromalli.
“The Mafia family would have been allowed – write the judges – to officially enter the municipality’s internal, facilitating the great possibility of control and command of public administration.”
The president of the Calabrés regional board Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between poor organized life are a lot" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes that remain clean.'
The arrested this morning are added to those of last July after police had announced the Piromalli Mafia family’s head cut.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always for alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been lifted from the command of managing the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, intendent, from the Udc at the time of the dissolution, after the ballot to May 2006, had been elected as head of a right-wing center coalition.
I explode a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call in question the vice minister of the interior that at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political matter, but the judges in the order of arrest signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even been asking for the change of the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, emerges the availability to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, a representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the elections of public administration on the interests of mafia families.
When energy is born from the waves, the big go down to the stage.
It is an exterminated site that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and are now discovering it, the world’s large energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the great people look like Chevron.
The possibility of collecting energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s along with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the low oil price, in 1980, the idea of taking advantage of marine energy was disappeared, but now that environmental cases and the new oil rise give the industry boost.
The London World Energy Council (WEC) has estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of global electrical need could be covered by implants that explode the movement of the sea waves.
This amount would be twice as much as currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would also be streams and tides.
Giants to the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in northern Portugal.
When the intent was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are always more and among these companies who have always voted for traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technology,” said a spokesman for a company associated with the American oil colossal to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal, “and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us.”
Cooperation in question is on obtaining a permission from the U.S. Energy Commission, to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a quite important signal, if it is considered that the US continues to extract oil in Alaska and recently President Bush has activated a plan to carry out new drillings.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, even though they are not detailed indicate an increased interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts talk about a technology still at the beginning, because marine energy doesn’t have any doubt that has a huge environmental impact.
For now, the impacts such as those Portuguese or the Scots are of small dimension and do not seem to create major problems with the ecosystem.
To produce long-scale energy, technology with greater environmental impact should be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of good bonds between them.
The strength of the waves, which moves the good up and down, turns into hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders into the inner of the waves.
The pressure rotates a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is shipped to the coast through submarine cables.
For now, there are four such implants in development, waiting only for federal approval, part of energy, could serve for a military facility.
Verdant Power, instead, already produces energy for a shopping center and for a parking, using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of the water when there are tides, rotating the pallets of the turbines, creating a rotary movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said it has a long list of customers waiting for the authorizations needed to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for Electrical Energy Development, at the moment merits the potential of tides.
While it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is above all about the energy of tides that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together to others approaching the coast, have invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and is expected to invest 35 million dollars in 2009.
