The ČSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the cake
The new ČSSD councillors in the capital will, as it seems, have to overcome the obvious linguistic barriers so that the components of the Prague Board and the Municipal Council understand their renewed SDG colleagues.
The Aktuálně.cz period "examined" the members of the new ČSSD Council to check their knowledge of the labeled slang language that has emerged in the Council in recent years, when Prague ruled the current members of the coalition.
The coded dictionary that used Prague’s flower and political nate during the previous period, Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been proven that new councillors almost do not understand those known concepts.
At least, that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is that I don't know."
"I am rather a newborn in Prague politics," said during the examination of terminology of "college" the councilman of culture Lukáš Kaucký.
And with regard to the political veteran, Karel Březina reacted equally.
Perhaps they know the concept "golf hole."
“It’s probably the only expression of all you asked me what I use from time to time.”
"Of no, usually in the Slang job."
From the glossary, whose definitions published the newspaper Aktuálně.cz last June before the SDG voting conference, the drafting chose six examples, particularly those that are especially related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "Prague's greater golf hole", "going to the cake," "bull's nudge", "traition of the capital" and "blinding".
Three councillors agreed to be subjected to the test and a quarter, Antonín Weinert, who will be responsible for education in Prague in the future, at first agreed, but did not take the phone again.
Fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, directly refused to do so.
“I don’t get into these things or think of how civic Democrats have fun.”
"What I care about is how we will understand ourselves in the execution of our programs," he said.
As has been seen, councillor Lukáš Kaucký had supposedly not realized that the previous title is an expression about an influential entrepreneur and a friend of ex-Mayor Bem, Roman Janoušek.
The word "Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky; the only term he hit in the exam is "the largest golf hole in Prague."
“This is the Blanka Tunnel,” says Kaucký, which immediately adds, “but rather I know for the news.”
"I'm going to have to target a language course," he jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also the Environmental Councilor Lukáš Plachý.
Then, both socio-democrats know who really is Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find that character; in addition, he suspects the meaning of "going to the cake."
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; it soon reveals Plachý that it is the headquarters of Janoušek companies.
Like Březina, he indicates that such knowledge obtained them from the news, but does not use such a vocabulary.
According to the test participants, there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms among socio-democrats.
"I asked my colleagues, but it really seems that we don't have anything like that."
“Better, among us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations, or make word games with the names,” says Praguense ČSSD President Petr Hulinský, whose fellow parties call Hulda.
"At school I was called Bříza, but I don't know if my companions also call me that," his own nickname Karel Březina confesses.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz tested the name and works.
For his colleagues, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they partnered before the deceitful elections during the sponsorship of the party, receives the name of "Igráček" ("playmobil") by some of his colleagues.
Calls are also the only expressions that socio-democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulinský doesn’t like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuálně.cz discovered even other nicknames for this Praguen president.
"The Doctor of the Rights of the Fucks" seems to recall that Petr Hulinský earned his doctoral degree in Law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of "witches," he published in a brochure
Women considered as witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They usually have an older age, cannot work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who “return” witches are sent to an isolated area, so they don’t harm the rest of the village.
"Mans rarely suffer such a sin."
“Neither isolates healthy young women, because they help in work and have children,” explains a nun who, in the capital of Western Africa, Burkina Faso is occupied in a special residence of more than 100 women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual “social measure”.
He issued a brochure that should help to avoid witch hunting.
However, this has a stick.
“More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,” the newspaper Die Standard warns about the disadvantages of written awareness.
Witch accusations are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighboring Burkina Faso, last week, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate cluster of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was held in the oil that is used for ritual oils.
He caught himself in fire when the group wanted to "expel the evil spirits" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports it by people of all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard cited a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: “Human soul devours always posed a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government tries to calm the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
“Gambia’s President Jammeh, after his aunt’s death, launched a wide hunt of witches who had allegedly been related to his death and tried to kill the president by black magic.”
“To help him brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president’s personal escort, led to force men and women randomly chosen among Gambia’s peoples to the president’s ownership in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
In the farm, people arrested had to drink a podium of herbs with hallucinogenic effects which also caused them intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested did not survive the stay at the farm.
Following international pressure, roughly a thousand people were finally released.
Bakala tenant: heated with coal greenhouses and signed a higher rental
The man, old and friendly, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal magnate" Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of flats for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he had documents with the new three-storey rental contracts: his own, his daughter's and his son's, who is fulfilling judgment.
All three have just pillared the liberalization of rent.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns a month, the child will pay 4,100 crowns for a two-bedroom floor with separate second-class kitchen.
"In addition, it does not have hot water and heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," the man shows with his finger in his son's new contract, on whose signature has full powers.
"But I signed it," explains half angry, half resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz civil association, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and indecent," recommends tenant not to sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7, when it will publish a guide informing about how to proceed in these cases.
But in front of this, man only makes one add-on.
"Everything says something," he says with bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a large liberalization test laboratory.
After New Year it will occur with the vast majority of the floors that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rental.
That is why Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of the four in Ostrava and, Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a machine to catch number.
"Hire 2011", can be read on a light button on your touch screen.
When pressing it, a paperboard with a number comes out of the machine.
Almost not gives time to read "157" and the number already appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the tail.
Shortly afterwards, an elderly marriage comes to ask, but the crowd of the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve usual problems, such as formerly: requests for arrangements, insurance issues and similar issues.
Letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to tenant boxes of most of the 44,000 RPG floors around mid-November.
Byty RPG suggests an increase in rental cards between 15 and 38%.
On November 18, a special window opens at the customer service center for new rentals.
"It's been working for a week, so it's starting," they answer, after briefly doubting, the workers who are in it when the customer appears as a journalist.
Liberalization and the former Bakala mining floors are the most delicate topics in the area.
Before the elections, the vice president of Parliament, originating in Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, already treated them highly and clearly, and now they appear continuously in the newspapers in the area.
“Twenty years later I want a new floor.”
"I didn't change the fucking plate of the bathroom," the man mentioned in the introduction was untouched.
According to the workers, for the moment more than anything retired come to check whether they get a discount on the rental if they sign in time, as the special RPG offer promises.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract will also receive half of the discount on the rent of February before December 15.
However, the window of the "liberalization" mining will certainly not be able to dissipate the avalanche of doubts.
“Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked about about forty or fifty people for the rental in 2011,” the window employee estimates.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the rent, an independent judge must solve the matter.
“This is not a threat, but information about the only way to proceed and completely in accordance with the law,” RPG warns on its pages.
"Nobody's going to judge here," one of Byty's RPG employees and a man who is on the street in front of the customer service center gives him, at least in part, the reason.
“I get a 13,000 pension and I’m left 5,000 for food; I have no means to go to courts,” he said.
But immediately, the employee sows the doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek warns you on the means that you don't sign, so maybe people wait," he said.
The rent regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is a economic need.
“The current rentals still don’t even cover the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund,” recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the RPG company’s residential portfolio, who adds that the neglected state of the community’s fund that angry with the tenants is, for the owners, the main reason to increase the rent.
While during the five years that passed between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest 4 billion rentals in apartments, in the four years that go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen that hangs from the ceiling, in front of the waiting room seats, now repeats some data that highlights in red.
"The rent increase in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be a maximum of 7.50 monthly Czech crowns per square meter," it is indicated on the screen.
Only 38% increased rental of 400 floors in the RPG portfolio.
“In such cases, it is an increase from extremely low amounts of 19.66 crowns per square meter,” RPG says.
On 2,600 floors, the rental will remain invariable next year.
Byty’s RPG promises that liberalization will not hit the rentals, but will escalate between four to eight years.
Furthermore, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rental rise (see the chart) back on the floors, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
People who sign the rental upload agreement will be priority.
Architects have understood that offices also need childcare.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say it also hides inside a small childhood with everything to such facilities: colored walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can come to her.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, from whose study numerous well-known buildings in Brno came out, thought of the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-guardianship.
In the company, around 90 people work, mainly at the age of baby boom and wanted to allow architects and delineators to return to work soon after motherhood.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, childcare is one of the benefits Arch.Design offers to its workers within the framework of its social program.
Constructors and architects in this way have the opportunity to combine a demanding profession with the care of children.
The mini-guardian was an idea of Arch.Designu’s employees themselves and, with the support of the management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-guardianship of the company is funded through the European Social Fund within the framework of the Operational Programme on Human Resources and Employment, as well as from the Czech Republic’s state budget.
Thanks to the funding granted (a grant of more than 2.8 million Czech crowns) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified staff and services.
When financing is exhausted (two years), Arch.Design has the obligation to keep the mini-guardianship in operation with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and in the submission of the financing application contributed the company Economy Rating.
Children’s attention is in the hands of qualified staff; in addition, they are present all day for their care a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education. Childcare currently welcomes children without age limits, although most of them are under three years of age.
Since this is a "mini-guardian," it can only simultaneously accommodate a maximum of five children, although with their turns they come more throughout the day.
The operation of the childcare is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the childcare, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although this is an individual teaching and care, the contents of the mini-guardian program are comparable to the usual pre-school teaching program.
In it, children not only play, but also receive quality teaching: from basic learning to school preparation, they teach English to English.
The class has not only toys and table games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of small children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up school children late when they are away from their workplace.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a relationship of loyalty between the employer and his employer.
Thus, Arch.Design is located amongst companies that signed that offer a huge advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program reinforced staff marketing.
The bone house continues to fascinate after 100 years. Observe the interiors of Gaudí
The roof looks like the loop of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs remember the column of a dinosaur, and the balconies look the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, of the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Due to its form similar to a skeleton, the locals called it "the bone house".
Its organic shapes, its flashing colors, the new use of the stone, the tiles and mosaic fragments, a facade that reminds the scales and all-present gently curved lines, all of this is typical of Antoni Gaudí’s secession.
The cover of the house plays with onyric lines, delicate colors and textures drawn from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought order is observed.
At night, the entire facade of the house looks even more impressive, since it is illuminated so that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Serpent and torsion of forms continue to surprise us also inside.
The wavy wood copies the frames of the windows, barrels, ornaments of the doors, mirrors and letters.
The Casa Batlló, located in the Eixample district at number 43 of the animated shopping street of Passeig de Gracia, emerged from the renovation of a house of 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the rich industrial Josep Batlló, initially insisted on breaking down the previous building and starting from zero, but soon accepted Gaudí’s idea of making a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the House Batlló, made up of various apartments, did not design it Antoni Gaudí alone.
He collaborated in the design by architect Josep María Jujol.
In fact, on their project plans, adornments arose for the representative apartment of the property owner and the mosaics used on the facade.
On the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of the Batlló House was the beginning of Jujol’s successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Milá and the Park Güell de Gaudí, where other pieces are found there.
Because of its organic form, the locals shortly after its completion called it "the bone house".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began to call it "the house of the boasts".
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, the sword of St. George, pattern of Catalonia, appears.
Other sculptural elements of construction hide religious motives.
Gaudí projected in the house a unique system for the central heating season with ventilation respirators and typical fireplaces.
It may be strange forty-five degree inclination.
During the construction, Gaudí did not respect the construction standards of the moment and was not allowed to influence them.
Still, the construction obtained the corresponding permit from the beginning, although evidently in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, the municipality was so impacted by the result it requested to be corrected.
It bothered him, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public staircase.
The arrangements were never carried out, rather on the contrary: only fifteen days after the municipality request, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two tallest floors of the building.
In the lower floors the owner himself was installed.
On the second floor gallery was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry.
The six-story house is completely crossed by a staircase that leads to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform were to break all the angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be completely connected by opening the doors of the salons and a larger group can be communicated in this way without a problem, without renouncement of the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only obtained a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles that cover the interior patio and lights.
The game with the two colors provides the maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which on the contrary absorb sun rays.
Anyone can visit the Batlló House, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and more recharged apartment of those accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that it is a very beneficial business and expanded the visits to the common area and the buhardilla, including the roof terrace.
The price of entry to the monument is not insignificant, reaching €16.50, although students, retirees and tourist cards holders get 20% off.
The amount significantly exceeds the price of the entry of other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the true bed atmosphere with your lizard towers, you should quickly be a friend of some neighboring house residents and visit them at home.
How to Choose Mattress and Somier: Women and Men Seek Different Things
Not a pompous frame for bed; what actually confers its quality to a good bed is the surface to lie down, that is, the mattress and the sommer.
First of all, they must be perfectly complemented to adapt to specific users.
During the choice, numerous elements come into play, including weight, height, health status and sex of the owner.
It is also important the type of interior in which the mattress and the somier are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cottage that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they are "heated" slowerly.
In addition, they usually weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattress.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them more often.
If the center channels are not aired properly and, above, are on a firm base, they keep in moisture. Even mold can appear below.
When choosing a bed, customs also influence.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad often use a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling well on a lower and harder surface.
“Almost all the hockey players who returned from the NHL complained that they didn’t sleep as well here.”
"For her becked shoulders, heels and hips needed mattresses with a soft viscoelastic layer."
“This type of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes that time the nervous system problems, so they receive poorly the information of the joints and the skin,” explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in the mattresses.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long been preferring viscoelastic mattress.
"Today there is no problem anymore, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italians Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You no longer have to be a NHL player in order to appreciate viscoelastic.
This "wonder" works in a very simple way.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape based on absorbed heat or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it won’t round like after a hard game.
Just sleep better.
Viscoelastic also works as a protection against injuries.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of your feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example singles, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
“If not, a simple norm can be applied to calculate the width: when sitting up, you should have your hands comfortably coiled towards the elbows,” advises the engineer Helena Prokopová, expert from Cechu Čalounikus to dekoraterů, who has been taking care of the problems of healthy sleep and ergonomic teaching theme for many years.
In the double rooms, each needs its own sommer and mattress, so during the purchase you need to pay attention to combine the height of the mattress.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the soyers at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the interior spring models at least 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that fits the shapes and softness.
“Touching it with the hand or accommodating on the mattress, the springs should certainly not be noticed,” warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of somier.
The bedrooms completely polished, where the mattress and the base are like Siamese, have no sense in the bedroom.
Mattress breathe badly and cannot wash their cover, which is often done today.
And since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a great (and congestioned) size.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that speak of a life of the mattress up to 25 years or even of a lifetime guarantee.
However, everything has one but.
Therefore, sellers give a tip: in mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully cover the cleaning and washing of the shell, but better add a mattresses protector that can be removed and washed easily.
Although mattresses with zipper closure are currently manufactured throughout their perimeter, so when opening them are left in two parts (something very important for washing and size of the washing machine!), their handling in larger models (and by a single person) when raising the mattresses may seem a fight between a fly and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a somier, do you have a firm table?
Never!
As much for beds designed to spend the visits one night.
However, you should do (if you do not already have them) ventilation holes on the table and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattress should not be used on such bases.
For non-jointable sheets and containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattress or sandwich mattress can be used (e.g., a combination of latex and coconut fiber), although it is always better to summer with a larger number of sheets, 28 or more, where the sheets of the lumbar area can be regularly reinforced and reinforced.
Joint sheets should not be used with a spring mattress, since it does not react to reclination.
In addition to the adjustment of the stiffness of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
It is a special attachment of the sheets that allows to press or even tilt the sheets in such a way that they "wheel" perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men with very wide shoulders, this is a very important thing.
Even mattress manufacturers are remembered that, in the "males," they began to use a softer area precisely around their shoulders.
Women are also remembered, for which they place a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are cross-structured or board-detached so-called multitortion dampers.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the voltage is reduced.
Also keep in mind that, even if you use the suitable mattress and somer, if you use a bad pillow (large and "mullid"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic norm is simple: the pillow should hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles thereof can be relaxed.
The recommended appropriate size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When falling aside, the pillow must be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder reinforcement or softer area of the mattress) than the shoulder height.
Modern mattress have something to do, as it seems, with the original straw-filled mattress.
Manufacturers continue to use, increasingly often, natural materials or at least mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are in fashion.
The oil-based raw materials, with which polyurethane foam is manufactured, are filled with natural oils, for example ricino or soybean.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soybean.
“Biological, in the case of mattress, means that the center is made only of natural materials,” explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also choose the microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" with wind plant extracts, so that the mattress cover absorbs the heat and refreshes the body, women prefer to "heat" the cover.
The red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel more warm.
Favorites currently?
Matraces made of cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, making them more permeable than normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam stiffness allows you to manufacture mattresses from various areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who play a therapeutic role often have a lower VAT, since they are considered to be a healthcare means.
The first to obtain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattress and soyers.
Sometimes the offers of manufacturers or sellers can be approved, which sometimes offer two mattress for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattress with a Memory foam attached to the cover for 11,990 crowns.
The second is obtained free of charge.
The era of viscoelastic with an open cell structure and a great density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
Initially it emerged as a material for NASA, because during astronauts were undergoing a huge overload during the flights.
Tempur limes with heat and hardens with cold.
Accordingly, the warm human body exercises a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Consequently, it is ideal to prevent injuries from occurring, although also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieved them, as well as their circulation.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More parents use people tracking devices to control their children.
Fear for children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for tracking vehicles, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
At the moment the device has the approximate size of a crayon box, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a clock.
Many people were afraid of the missing Anička case and began to report on the available means to better protect their children.
Even the cost of invading your privacy.
“We all try to tell ourselves that it’s not about spying, but about another means to decrease the chances of a tragedy occurring,” says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the Czech market’s tracking device suppliers.
“I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they are put into someone’s pocket without their knowledge, but we have not yet topped ourselves with such cases.”
"Most customers really buy it for safety reasons," Pilin adds.
In their opinion, children should always know what the "box" is used for and how it is used in an emergency case.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns that if the child doesn’t want to take him, he will simply throw him out.
"Even younger children show great creativity when they intentionally lose certain things if they want to avoid controlling them."
“Before, parents relyed enormously on mobiles, but these could be turned off as easily as the tracking device,” said Bočková.
In his opinion, it is discussible whether in case of attack such a device is really useful.
“If it’s a prepared kidnapping, the author will almost always check whether the child has any kind of electronic device that can reveal its location.”
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices is extended, it will also look for them, since their sale will certainly be done with much advertising."
“In such cases, criminals always go a step ahead of the police,” the psychologist says.
However, it adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack of a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of the RC Monitoring company, who offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence may serve as a help.
“The device can be configured so that it regularly sends the position after a certain period.”
"If you suffer damage, it will at least facilitate the last position of the person in question."
“The most expensive devices carry an inclination meter integrated, so if the person simply slips down and remains immobile, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question,” said Čech.
In your opinion, such a service can be obtained even with smartphones with navigation, where special software should only be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment it is about devices with a size similar to a crate box or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, for that reason, tests are currently being conducted with devices that resemble a digital clock.
“Besides, they will have the added advantage that a possible aggressor may not identify the device.”
"Or identify it after a certain time, which can make the police gain time," he adds.
Although tracking devices are carried on the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology that is used for tracking vehicles.
This is the test of the position with a GPS system (which is used in usual car navigation) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough meches to surround all of the Czech Republic, but they only last two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of mecha to arrest explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense added to its arsenal 224 kilometers of mecha.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the mesh is two years, four up to the most.
The army bought the explosive mesh from the STV Group for forty million crowns.
General staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of mesh saying that soldiers need mesh for training manoeuvres 60 kilometers a year.
According to the calculations of pyrotechnicians of the army, with whom MF DNES was contacted, it is however decided that, in such a case, such maneuvers with frequent use of explosives each year should also perform all generals, senior officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want exemptions neither the Defense Minister Alexandr Vondr and the captain of the Army Vlastimil Picek.
Only thus could it be justified that the army spends sixty kilometers of mesh.
Such a length equals 25,000 explosions.
Although it was so, the army would have enough stocks for more than ten years.
If on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two meters of mesh, the army would have with the new purchase (even by adding consumption of engineers or special units) sufficient stocks for the 225 above.
The soldiers of the Quick Intervention Brigade complained personally recently to Minister Vondra because they say they have little ammunition for various weapons, thus even cash shooting practices are limited.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
“I also cannot understand that you repeatedly understand such amounts of mesh.”
“But it’s your decision and you’ll certainly know why you act like that.”
“For us, the army is a good customer to whom we as a company try to satisfy,” admits STV Group’s business director Jan Děcký.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek defends hundreds of kilometers of mecha saying he will have stocks of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký, from STV Group, indicates that the mesh only has a lifetime of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnical products for the army or police, two years.
“If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four,” says one of the soldiers who, for the possible criticism of the army, does not want to give his name.
After completion of your lifetime, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument by the Ministry is that, by purchasing 445 kilometers of mecha, he obtained a discount.
“We cost 60% less than the last year’s order of 244 kilometers,” spokesman Pejšek from the Defense Ministry’s shopping centre said.
Only to compare: the annual mesh consumption of the pyrotechnicians of the police, who eliminate the ammunition from World War II or left by the Soviet army, has no longer exceeded 1,500 meters for years.
Furthermore, the police always demand only the fair amount to exhaust the ammunition before their lifetime is over.
They decided it for safety reasons for pyrotechnicians and, in the meantime, more modern and reliable types of mesh can be achieved.
The Ministry has already had clear difficulties to finish tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Covenant era, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign in the Rin.
According to pyrotechnicians with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current: there will be hundreds of kilometers of old mesh that is now buying “cheap”.
So far I still live from the contacts I got thanks to the contest.
The winning of the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest helped Lukáš Pytloun in the sale of his hotel's franchises.
The last edition, wins the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest, the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun of Liberec.
His success story seems out of a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun loved travel.
Abroad he realized that in Liberec there was a need for quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he gathered with seasonal abroad jobs and a bank credit he bought a house that was half ruined composed of five floors.
Given that he was still studying his third year in college, he was really brave.
“Today, the value-price ratio of the accommodation in our area has driven me to do something about it,” says Lukáš Pytloun.
He began to rent the first rebuilt floor to foreign workers.
All the income that he obtained invested them back into the building, which gradually turned into a 54-room pension.
Since then, in seven years in the business, she gradually opened four pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
This year, however, opened another of the same quality.
“We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisè, to which we have sold our concept of franchise, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise,” said the entrepreneur number one last year.
“To this sale of licenses for hotel opening greatly helped the fact of winning the ‘Entrepreneur of the Year’ contest,” Pytloun adds thankful.
The victory increased its fame and popularity both in Liberec and the surrounding area.
“People recognized me on the street, still congratulated me often and, I must say, I was very nice,” he recalls.
No doubt, it recommends that anyone wants to try any company to participate in the contest.
But he thinks that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he continues to live from the contacts and known that, without the contest, he may not have obtained.
“With some people I met thanks to the contest, I started collaborating regularly.”
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in employees,
In total, about seventy.
“I have seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that gained general recognition.”
“It’s not, not much less, my own personal success, but it’s the result of the entire team’s hard work.”
“Just my name is the one that appears on the first flat,” Lukáš Pytloun says modestly today.
I wish my successor a more quiet year than we have had at Farmet.
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated from the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, Farmet may have already happened the worst.
Owner of the company Farmet, Karel Žďárský, received the first award in the last edition of the Vodafone "Enterprise of the Year" contest last year at the "Slav House" in Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, with which he managed to convert a small technical workshop in Česká Skalice into a firm with a revenue volume of hundreds of millions.
“I can say that the prize not only encouraged me, but all my employees and improved our confidence to fight competition,” says last year’s winner.
The story of the company Farmet begins with the desire to do something useful.
That’s why, when the State proposed to Karel’s father to rent a small workshop as compensation for the embargo of property during communism, he did not doubt too much; he resigned his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Shortly afterwards, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of auto presses in Central Europe.
They also gained greater presence among the non-specialized public after achieving success in the contest in the media.
“Not only began our customers to consider the Farmet brand as considerably better, but also foreign partners began to value collaboration with a company that achieved greater success in their country,” says Karel Žaárský.
Last year perhaps it was not in Farmet just a sample of the euphoria of victory.
It also received recognition for trade results until 2008 and, partly, 2009.
And just 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not yet achieved so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and began to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
“Obviously, we don’t get rid of such a situation either.”
“Income dropped by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some dismissals,” explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company should sometimes take even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the profits of the company, even if it was at lower levels than before the crisis.
Nonetheless, where Farmet did not cut spending was in research and development.
“With the grants we have built a research and training center, strengthened the presence in the international market and obtained magnificent ratings at national fairs,” says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Income increases again and with them the number of new employees.
“The new achievement hopes that it will bring a feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere,” says Karel Žďárský.
A survey that reveals ridiculous rules
The Absurdez survey of the year is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
It has already been able to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdez survey of the year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents to which officials can access online.
The decision adopted more than one-third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, social security administration requested an extract from the trade record, although its officials can get it with two movements of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
“The Czech administration of social security will no longer request an extract from the trade record when carrying out a control of the insurer’s impositions,” said ČSSZ spokesman Jana Buraňová.
The goal of the Absurdity Survey of the Year is to consult the rules and regulations that businesses and entrepreneurs must respect in Czech Republic and attempt to eliminate those absurd.
This year is for the fourth time the business tournament of the publication Hospodářské noviny and also begins to create hobbies among the general audience.
While last year’s edition had the participation of three thousand voters, this year virtually reached the four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have a number of legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
“Perhaps in numbers of papers needed for the tax declaration we are first in the world,” said Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business standards has been a declared goal for all governments for years.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, Czech Republic is in position 74a, that is, eight positions worse than last year.
The Absurdez contest of the year was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated in the same way each year.
Anyone can indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September when the contest is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the contest organizer chooses seven candidates for the "anti-award" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It gains the absurdity that receives more votes.
For this year’s survey, more than 100 were presented, in particular 105 rules and regulations that make no sense.
The examples sent them both entrepreneurs and professional associations and journalists.
Among the “finals” of the contest was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for road maintenance and highways pay toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of this year’s seventy proposals is published on the contest pages.
The announcement of the contest, which is always held in early November in Prague’s Wenceslao Square, is part of an event where political and social personalities often participate.
This year, for example, they attended this event of the contest Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
“Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the state continuously hinders entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessaryly complicate trade every year,” said the Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in water of bursts.
In 2007, what was most bothering people was the duty of the entrepreneur to communicate three days in advance to the business office in the permanent operating area, the intention of going to a position at a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended second in the number of votes in 2007, i.e. communication to the work office by its foreign workers from work travels up to 30 days, was removed in the law of the so-called green card.
And the third is going to be defeated.
The 2009 Absurdity was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
That’s why this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are appreciated.
The news in this fifth edition of the Hospodářské noviny contest is the category called Company responsible for 2010.
The objective of this contest is to support responsible and fair companies.
“This way we want to support companies that take care of the impact of their activity on the environment and support socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the Vodafone company’s mobile operator, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the year’s Rebel competition.
For this new special subcategory of this year’s edition of the 2010 Vodafone Enterprise main contest, companies for which commercial success is not the only long-term goal were presented.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities vary completely between one and another, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, these are, for example, persons with disabilities, in others of personal or employee health issues.
Among the fourteen finalists across the Republic was, for example, the prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of the company responsible for the Pardubice area is Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the leading funding provider for seven years to sponsor children with disabilities.
In Poděbrad, there is a paperwork that is particularly concerned with the health problems of its workers, as they constitute more than 70% of the template; therefore he received the title of Enterprise responsible for the central area of Czech Republic and in the year’s Vodafone Enterprise contest ended third in the region.
In Olomouc, MiRyz Soft won the accounting company, which reduced work hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it purchases primarily from Czech manufacturers, supports community activities in the area and respects the environment.
“We attempt to recycle as much as possible so that our production and administration activities have the least possible impact on the environment,” explains the company Miluše Ryznarová.
IT company Enlogit in the Ústí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; in addition, it supports work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a locally protected company.
"In addition, we support the Persona scholarship in trouble, which in particular helps the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, representative of the company.
The laundry company Praní to Čištění in the Karlovy Vary region is also in good place with a mention, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that impact their pension funds.
“We give benefits in food, transportation, improving qualifications and leisure,” says Josef Strapáč, the construction company of Bruntál Czasch, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of Enterprise responsible for the year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Enterprise contest of the year were automatically designated to respond to the questions in the registration form and sent it to the organizers before August 15.
The organizers removed from the evaluation forms that were not complete or wrong.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Enterprise contest responsible for the year, but are not disqualified from the "principal" Vodafone Enterprise contest of the year."
“The individual candidates for this contest are not allowed, as it is a subcategory of the main Enterprise contest of the year,” explains Karel Goldman from Bison & Rose advisory.
Police arrested during public auction at the building of the Agricultural Fund in Pilsen
Police against corruption have held several arrests in the building of the Agricultural Fund in recent days.
The detectives spoiled a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
It seems that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the auctioned ground was received by an accurate interested party.
I had to pay for Luboš G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and tender," Attorney General Chief of Pilsen Antonie Zelená told Pravo, adding that for the moment they cannot disclose more details about the ongoing investigation.
After twenty-four hours, the police released the 46-year-old entrepreneur.
About the way it could influence public auction, given the little official information, can only be speculated.
The spokesman for the Agricultural Fund Lubomíra Černa answered Pravo’s questions saying police actually held the arrest at Plsen’s headquarters and was during a public auction.
“It’s a customer, not one of our workers,” he said.
According to Černa, the public auction is called "Call for submitting proposals for land transfer in accordance with the law on land" and is carried out when several stakeholders appear in relation to the land offered.
“These people, during the call, offer a value higher than their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced.”
"Based on the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the biggest offer," the spokesman explained.
Luboš G. had information about who was to be submitted to the call and, given that he was at the same time interested because he acquired various refund rights, he proposed to the stakeholders on the ground that they would not participate in the auction.
Please, it was charged a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, I had so much money on it.
Luboš G. had special contacts at the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
He was figured in the case of the former PF head Václav Sankot, who was accused of shipping the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund ground planned for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular in the place where a large road should be constructed to the industrial area of Borská pole.
Then he changed them very beneficially with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city itself with a much higher value.
In this case, the council had to intervene because, otherwise, the blocked land would avoid construction.
Families must pay additional expenses of several hundred crowns per month
Homes will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, larger rentals.
Therefore, families will have to get out of the portfolio, from January, several hundred crowns a month more than now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, gas around 2%, in some cities must pay up to 10% more for water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise of electricity for families living in apartments should be about 100 more crowns a year than now.
Leading electricity suppliers, however, reduced prices because support for renewable energy production, particularly photovoltaics, has increased.
However, gas grows moderately, especially at the time when heating is most used and therefore the greater consumption.
In this case, they should also have a couple of hundreds more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas grow throughout the country, the price change of central heating varies from one place to another.
The price rise plans it primarily the largest municipality.
For example, Pardubice or Hradec Králové households will pay from January for central heating about 50 more crowns a month, while Liberec families will pay more than 1,000 additional crowns a year.
Residents in Prague must also support a 9% increase in water and heating prices, especially in the event that the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rental does not vary, the Praguens will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will be 7.4%.
The rental prices of 450,000 rented flats in Prague can be significantly increased, where regulation will end in January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns in Ústí nad Labem around 2,500 floors, will increase the rental from January to 100%.
The company will take the courts to those who do not agree with the new rental.
Regulated rentals, which benefit residents of around 300,000 floors, could increase up to 10% next year.
Czech young people get drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer in mode, because it effects slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause young drinkers under fifteen years of age to end medical care.
Children who end up living in the hospital continuously to overcome the shell are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors encountered such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to drunk them."
“Now fashion is the strong alcoholic beverages,” tells Pravo, chief pediatrician at Hořovice Hospital in central Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán.
“When they manage to catch a bottle from their father from the alacence, it may be whisky, but it’s usually about Fernet and vodka.”
“The vodka has the advantage that it lightes with juice and that it doesn’t smell so much,” he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokesman of the University Hospital Motol, Eva Jurinova.
"Usually it's Fernet or Ron."
“These are modern alcoholic beverages, especially among schoolers.”
“In some cases, they use waiting that they picked up at home,” Jurinova adds.
According to Boss Pelikan, they are thirteen and fourteen-year-old drinkers who usually appear in hospitals.
Before Horovice, where he worked since this year, he worked for a decade in the pediatrics in Motol, where the ambulances carried young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to enter perhaps four times."
“He began at the age of twelve when he brought it with 3.5 alcohol in blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy,” the department’s doctor says on this case.
"He was at the Holešovice fair at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother neither was surprised that his daughter disappeared 48 hours," the boss was surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance towards drinking by their children which is considered the main cause of increasing alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, it is not possible to speak of dependence.
"It is meant by alcoholic to a person who has a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
“In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment,” explains Chief Pelikan.
According to spokesman Jurinova, this year at Motol’s pediatric clinic, forty drunk children were hospitalized until mid-November.
However, statistics only show those who come with severe poisoning and should stay in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after ambulant medical examination, go home with their parents or with the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases in which children simply meet behind school and drink wait, there are three seasonal highlights that must be mentioned: the day of witches, the end of the year and the end of the school course.
"In such a circumstance, they drink for the bad notes or, on the contrary, they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
“On the witches’ day I have come to see in admissions up to seven drunk children at once,” Pelikan said.
Drinkers who spend the night in detox under physician supervision, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible shell at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by the injection of a serum with glucose and with the lack of nutrients to the body.
"These take him much better, because after the bustling night they get up well and nothing hurts them."
“They are only confused about where they are,” Pelikan says, adding that patients often lose good mood at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
Ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a room for serious patients cost a ten thousand crowns.
“I’ve often used the cost as a means of educating them, when in the visit I tell them directly to the children how much their drunkness has costed and they’d have to spend the whole summer in a youth job to win enough to pay that night,” Pelikan adds.
Medical insurance, in your opinion perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually returns the expenses of treatment to people, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in outside hands in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, by which the Czech Defense Ministry replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, left on Tuesday to Seville, where the manufacturer of the aircraft is located Casa - EADS.
This is the first time that such a device is in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
At the moment, they were abroad only for practice or demonstration flights.
It is the L-159T1 biplaza version, which so far used the Czech army and was still in the state of flying.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 monoplate.
These are still retained at Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, the company Omnipol, took over of them last week.
Jan Peješk, of the defense press department, indicates that it is not yet known when Vodochody's aircraft will be physically withdrawn.
"Monoplaza L-159 aircraft, instead, were separated from repaired aircraft long ago, without investment or additional contributions by the Ministry."
"The L-159T1 biplates were exchanged in their current state," he told Právo Pejšek.
In May 2009, the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices.
One of the new aircraft already received it by the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS committed to adding aircraft to the equipment of some allies.
“The contract clearly indicates that the company EADS is the one that withdraws L-159 aircraft and will serve for NATO-country pilot practices.”
"So it depends on the buyer to decide how he will use them in this framework," Pejšek says.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa plane and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolanek.
The Ministry of Defense did not call for a tender for purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defence management states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
Buying House planes may have judicial consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court because it should choose aircraft by making a European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa aircraft and the last one should reach Prague airport in Kbely in fourteen days.
A longer index finger than the annular indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longer index than the annular are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British journal on cancer.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
“Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to 60 years of age,” said Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
Accordingly, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, as Eeles indicates.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and simultaneously 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the indic finger of the right hand shorter than the ring.
They had the same chances of suffering from prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of men with a longer index than the annular finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under 60%, the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined during the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows the study, but he doesn’t seem that the relationship between the length of his fingers and cancer can be “demonstrated completely.”
Czech Republic undersnow: D1 and D5 are closed
Czech Republic, like most of Europe, went up on Thursday’s snow cover.
The roads and stairways are mainly covered by compact snow and the snowwater machines circulated all night through numerous areas.
In the morning, the D5 road was closed between 89 and 93 kilometres towards Rozvadov due to several industrial and car accidents, as well as the D1 in Brno towards Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Ústředního Autotoklubu (ÚAMK).
In the mile 91 a truck was broken, in the mile 93 two industrial vehicles hit that caused injuries.
Several cars also ended in the cuvette.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway in the 185 mile towards Prague.
There were two trucks shocked.
Drivers must circulate slowly behind Brno in the mile 190 or cross Brno and be incorporated in the mile 182 in Kývalce.
There have been several kilometers of clutches.
An accident has also occurred on the D11 road, just next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a snow layer of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 oC.
Stamps are formed, for example, in Prosek, although Štěrboholská is also congestioned.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams circulate delayed, for example on the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Míru.
At eight in the morning, another crisis state will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect railways and airport.
Due to the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections for three fast.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travelers should check what the current situation is.
Ruzyně airport closed from 11:00 a.m. on Wednesday evening until 5:00 a.m.
Currently, it can already be circulated through most roads in southern Moravia, but with extreme precaution.
In Vyškovska are closed to the circulation of three secondary roads, in Brněnska snow languages are being formed and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain routes of access to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
To clean them, milling machines will be required.
At the moment, it cannot be said when they will be opened to the circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Bilé Karpaty (White Carpats).
The roads in the region that, given that it is a protected natural area, should simply be left in inert state, are accumulated up to five centimeters of snow, as ČTK indicates.
In Czech fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow layer reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Sylesia region, they fell around 15 centimeters of snow.
The snowfalls gradually refer to Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon"
The American army is using a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, known for the moment only by the encoded name XM-25.
Generals hope the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and "change the progress of the game" to win.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely accurate punch.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm calibre ammunition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives it contains causes it to actually work as a small granate.
The projectiles can be scheduled to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic path.
They can be used against enemies that hide behind an obstacle, a wall or a trinch.
Undoubtedly, normal protection cannot be used and, when you throw your killer rain from metal stems, it can be essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new gun is the first infantry weapon using “intelligent” technology.
“The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to the same their laser light, which determines the distance, then get a precise point of view and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and presses the trigger.”
"Let's say it's been measured 543 meters."
“When the trigger is pressed, the gun is charged and thrown the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, plus one, two or three meters,” Audette says.
400 jobs are moved
Fujitsu Consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July the next year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer industry giant and its maintenance reported Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July the next year of their former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg at Astro Park, a large office complex at Lyoner Straße in Niederrad neighborhood in Frankfurt.
A spokesman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term another 100 more employees of the consortium, who were previously spread across the region, will stay there.
The offer is highly attractive, as well as the collective office at Astro Park will favour the employee’s way of working.
Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, “In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure.”
The brilliant connection to the airport is today very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new movement of an important company in the region led to joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against.
Frankfurt Economics Section Head Markus Frank (CDU) said that it has won a “Global Player”.
This is a “magnificent recognition of the location.”
Fujitsu sits in the city, the settlement is a great boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regrets Fujitsu’s decision.
The direction previously informed the city of its intent.
“Naturally we have offered our help to the company,” Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
Eventually, economic motives caused the fall.
In this way, there is now a great empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I hope the owner and the tenant of the building will be cooperative."
The property previously used by Fujitsu at the Rathausplatz and the neighboring Kleine Vertikale were part of the remaining buildings of Marienbader Platz since ten years of a controversial construction project of the bathing town.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the municipality, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for criticizing the mass building that previously used gaps as parking spaces and the level of buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating companies, the booking system software manufacturer, Start Amadeus, and then joined Siemens with the Fujitsu computer manufacturer house.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe along with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu Consortium, originating in Tokyo, is recognized as the third largest worldwide IT provider.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides the precise services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has more businesses in Munich.
Fujitsu Technology Solutions is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries here will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
That’s why 7,000 square meters have been rented in Astro Park’s office building.
The old complex of the 1920s, its name refers to its star-shaped plane, houses among others the central electrotechnical association and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
The anguish is increasingly taking over Wikileaks.
The internet service provider Amazon has removed the revelations platform from its server.
Political pressure may be behind after hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents are published.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, appears to be arrested in England.
Wikileaks’ revelations platform is always the white of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an internet country in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and companies to the boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s list of sought-after people, must remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from Amazon's server."
“Speaking freely in the country of freedom,” the activists reported on the revelations through the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon service web to be able to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks explained, “Perfect, we will spend our dollars to hire people in Europe.”
If Amazon has problems with freedom of speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped the use of its server through Wikileaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, the CNN chain reported on a call to Lieberman’s office.
The president of the country’s Senate’s Security Council had threatened Amazon with boycott, the British “Guardian” reported.
"He had wanted Amazon to take these steps before, before previous publications of information classified by Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also ban server use in other countries.
“Wikileaks’ illegal, monstrous and unconsidered process puts our national security at stake and threatens life in the world,” the independent senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service to extend stolen material.
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is searched for rape in Sweden, is on Interpol’s list of people searched for.
According to an article from the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The internet activist has constantly rated the research in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats in London.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That is why he is afraid of Assange's security, said Hrafnsson.
Therefore, the location of the founder of Wikileaks is still not revealed.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to North America’s statements.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, claimed that the responsible for Wikileaks’ revelations must be tried for betrayal and must be executed.
In Canada, a counselor of administration chief Stephen Harper said, clearly with irony, on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange a great dispute grows.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called Assange as “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange has requested the resignation of the Secretary of State, in case she is responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in espionage tasks.
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about a guy’s opinion with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than its website.”
The U.S. government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of the protection of its databases in general.
Russell Travers, Deputy Director of Distribution of the National Center Against Terrorism, was appointed exceptional charger, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing the “important structural reforms”, which are necessary in light of Wikileaks’ filtration.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as to change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that in order to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists, the publication of Wikileaks must be endangered.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
“We are prepared to help protect them if necessary.”
The University of Ice Cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice creams are prepared in the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future ice creams has the maximum flow and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream come from?
Gelatiere and Gelatiere.
The gelatiere manufactures the cream according to all rules of Italian art of ice cream.
The glacier takes the ice cream from the counter with a spatula, extends it over the bark and sells it.
To know this, you don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice creams should not visit the Italian company Carpigiani's "Gelato University".
The manufacturer has equipped the college of ice cream with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream of its machines meets the highest Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future ice creams has the maximum flow and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses for more days on chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice cream of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new professional career, others risk soft ice cream their vague desires.
This time they are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of this California art, loves the slow food movement and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business advisor and wants to create something own in a few years within an enervant job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream in Cairo.
One man from Malta and another from Brazil wants to improve the quality of the ice cream of his bars, and a Canadian homemade Julia comes because his children love Italian ice cream.
Ice cream master Luciano Ferrari later explains to the participants the ideal qualities of perfect ice cream.
It is not only decisive for its good taste, but also for its soft silk and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation or the nate cover of the national top house and mainly south of the country: "The Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that is why each ball has something romantic."
The first step towards the elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano throws the basic ingredients: milk, nate, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large battery, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the moment cooles it up to four degrees.
Then opens the machine clip and comes out a white pasteurized basic cream, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can the ice cream be produced only with natural elements or without stallizer?
How can some desire to experience be released?
Luciano advises you to leave the trends of the time.
The one who speaks of ice cream "not only of natural ingredients", maybe has used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar rubber, guar beans.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, place it in a bag and the customer will bite a granite ice sound.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, master Luciano distinguishes the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit section or in the sweets section of the supermarket.
Also, there are powders and pastes.
"All suppliers will try to glue flavored ingredients into their goods."
"However, they must ever experience."
Whether with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the white basic mass, which with eggs will become a yellow cream with cocoa powder as the basis for all possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now the course participants can use the ice cream.
Luciano allows them to produce every time four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocca and avellana ice cream, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
They also perform the same experiment with types of fruit ice cream.
If you know better, it does not necessarily depend on whether you have more toast or more fruit puree.
It is not necessary for the ice cream to know dry fruits, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group produces the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruits, less water and less stabilizer.
First a balanced mixture highlights the taste of ice cream, Luciano says.
Ice creation is an artimetic problem: Melocott puree with lots of sugar is used, the proportion of sugar should be reduced from the basic recipe.
For lemon ice cream an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano draws a utensil with which it fixes the amount of sugar from the fruit types (measurement of the wine farmer for Oechsle in the grape most).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate the account.
Ice cream requires nothing more than physical application, as before.
Not only helps the utensil for the automatic production of the basic mass.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice mixture is simultaneously fighted and cooled at zero temperature.
Nonetheless, all the automation remains out in terms of the small folder.
The Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his companions from up to down with fruit puree, as if he was a giant miniprimer uncontrolled.
“In all courses,” says master Luciano, “it’s just a matter of time that something like this happens.”
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry that experiences transgenic plants.
Currently this issue is formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an institute for independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It seems a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well," said Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech in Munich on Wednesday.
Harry Kuiper, the director of Efsa’s expert group on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert have also been hired for years in the Ilsi association.
Consortiums such as Monsanto, Nestle, or Bayer cover it.
Kuiper has significantly collaborated in genetically modified plant EFSA check standards, which places him in a clear conflict of interests, criticizes Then.
Efsa’s provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of Ilsi’s situation and mimic the writing of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech criticizes a collision of interest.
Thus, recently, a top-range manager at Efsa was without the support or the transition time to the Swiss Agrakonzern Syngenta, and has changed with that its side.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and the industry, which held the General Office of the Environment as well as a EU parliamentary clarifier.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, also some of the industry, provided they are of high quality and technical quality, are ordered in a report.
Experts working at Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the U.S.
It is called itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and policy, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without Lobby’s responsibility.
In this subject, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that they do not check the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment.
“We want to know what, for example, makes genetically modified maize in agriculture,” says Then.
The current practice consists of checking only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how will you find themselves?", asks the accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck thinks the same way.
The scientist has been investigating the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical Institute in Zurich.
In this field, the industry is increasingly trying, in the US and Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
There are few scientists who are not influenced by consortiums.
For companies, critical studies are not published in general.
“The industry controls security research,” Hilbeck continues.
The trace of the stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, in total about 400 pounds.
On Monday he was in front of Stuttgart Station, with the Tuba behind his back.
There were demonstrations
Nevaba.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to drop down a large piece of the northern wing.
Stuttgart land never again became the same: Thousands and thousands protested against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was struck, most of the wings were broken down.
Route in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muchelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics."
"You shouldn't disappear."
It is excited: "A cheap and poor, simple and natural stone."
As he once said, he smells the smoke of the cigarettes.
He still don't know what he'll do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The Stuttgart stone trace leads to a forest in Tubingen in an earlier ammunition deposit by the French Navy, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man treats ancient stones.
Bought everything resulting from the demolition in Stuttgart.
“It would have been disgrace, they would melt the grab or send it to the wastemaker,” says in his office, a wooden caset that once was a guard caset.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the northern wing from the dropping company.
He spoke with the enemies of the 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing for the downfall.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable thing, when the stones continued to be used.
About 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilogram cut maze, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a memory but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest has been sold for a long time.
Owner of gardens, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could be carried in the bag and upon them.
Stuttgart's stone of the impulse has long become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
“This stone is actually nothing special,” says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political component."
It climbs to its all-terreno, makes a tour for its great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied right, discontinued his studies, and later biology, he is interested in computers, and finally works with stones.
And he is a lover of the stones.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
He transports his treasures throughout Germany.
He says he is the largest ancient stone treater in the country.
French.
In the snow there are artistic sandstone picked.
"They belonged to the bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke," he explains.
Evening, yellow, warm, gets excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Signs a lot: Red Arenisca, a previous piece of Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Good travertino."
Formerly the Mazis belonged to the Stuttgart Neckarstadion Tribune.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite from the Church of Sankt Blasien, toba from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he previously sculpted the stones and moved them with a simple appliance and a truck, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something would be destroyed."
It has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today, 14 people have to do the stone trailer, plus canters, a sculptor, a boiler, a glassmaker and a gardener have been installed up in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfactory,” says the man who takes care of taking advantage of the remains.
Soon you have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Fighting talents around great potentials
Queen an active flow in the buffet.
16 students hang around the pans, tomato soup and sweets.
The Braunschweig Technical University and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited students of mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a sort of idea contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Rivalying and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, gather in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaboration with universities.
Hire students with more talent from universities as soon as they enter the job market and are hired by others.
And since universities do not facilitate publications about the skills of their students, exceptional talents are attempted to reach out in practical projects and capture them.
The second project day at Braunscheig Technical University, the consortium wins talents.
A lady from the staff department shares pens, gums and folders with VW logo.
It explains the illusionate young talents the internship programs and student jobs and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle from Braunschweig Technical University leads the project with VW.
See advantages for both sides: "Students come in touch with the industry and acquire experience."
"In turn, VW can meet students, watch interesting candidates closer, and consider them as possible future workers."
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not unusual.
The newness is that students are so directly desired.
“The main point previously was in technical projects,” says Selle.
The struggle for fresh graduates is becoming harder.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
But they have to be announced and, above all, to achieve a highly qualified labour force.
All students in the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), in October there were 40,000 positions of vacant engineers.
And, according to VDI forecast, this engineer vacuum will grow even further.
In the audit and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for talent hunting.
It organizes expensive hiring events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yellow, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. the next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the exit.
Only cream cream from many participants goes to the U.S.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and polish the highest potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out of the mass."
"The simple journey on its own was left short."
For the cazatalents Dykta the notes give results.
“Until today we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants.”
“Some are close to their end, and they want to request to work with us,” he says.
In addition to the direct approach on the campus, they are also on hunting, above all, small and medium-sized, classic businesses with their work fairs.
"We're trying to get students at the specialty fairs."
"Something about Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, staff in charge of Solarworld solar technology manufacturer.
The company Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
There are currently 35 vacancy jobs on the company’s website.
“It’s very difficult to fill up vacant jobs.”
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
A shorter path is contact with university teachers.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
“The teachers advise that you can practice with us or perform their thesis.
There are no face advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That’s why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A great consortium can't offer it normally," said Stübe, the staff officer.
In search of a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
Decisive factors are flexible work schedules, child assistance or good possibilities of rise.
According to a study from the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld has 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute prepares an annual list of the best German employment providers.
For what asks the employee how satisfied he is with the job and the environment in it and observes the pre-conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff officer also expects extra points in their rankings for their aspirants to work.
“I think the applicant is particularly fixed on the external classifications of a potential employer,” he said.
Wolf Reiner Krieger from the Deutschen Employer Branding Academy advises companies to want a long-term strategy to win good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to become attractive as an employer goes through employees themselves,” he says.
In the industry’s jersey it is called Employer Branding internal, also promoting corporate identity within the template itself.
"The satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When it treats people well and identify it with the company, it gets promotion directly for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a gang game,” says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drillings
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in these years.
The Washington government issued a substantial ban and thus unappealing its previous plans.
Also on the Atlantic coast remains new perforations sealed for the moment.
This announced Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What caused this strict ban, which will be in force for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil platform in April.
Before the misery that cost the life of eleven workers and caused the largest environmental catastrophe in the U.S., President Barack Obama had admitted new drillings in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
Supporters thus wanted to decrease U.S. dependence on new foreign oil supplies.
Until today, it has not been cleared who is the responsibility of the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the center of criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of demands.
An investigative committee in charge of Obama will present its results in December.
In October, internal minister Ken Salazar raised the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, various petroleum consortiums filed applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe using harder controls and stricter security regulations.
Currently the responsible control authority, which, after being accused of corruption charges, has fallen into discredit, is rooted reform.
Obama parallelly announces that profitable tax lacunes for oil and gas consortiums will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the Gulf will be lower thanks to stricter regulation, to date.
“Government plans are the largest brake for the growth of oil and gas industries,” says the result of the current survey carried out by the advisory company BDO – prior to the Wednesday ban on extraction.
American Energey Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: “No one knows what changes exactly with regulation.”
Investments in new extraction projects are prolonged soon, in detriment of growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil marble, smells like a petrol station: millions of litres of crude poured have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogonilandia.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari looks fine.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassures journalists: "Today it will pass enough oil in front of your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys walking in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
It is not seen that on the surface floats brown spots of oil.
Before here he took gambas to hands, explains Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipe.
The fish in the surrounding small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach waters full of fish: Which, in the heart of the delta of Niger and located in Ogonilandia, is considered one of the most dizzy regions in the world.
Along the path of the river journey that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship’s engine moves a brown boil, who dips his hand into the water, will take some full of oil.
The roots of the mangroves trees rise from the ground as dark regal sticks, sadly isolate the palm trees that hit and hanging their palms.
In vain, birds are looking for bands, as if they were on the wetland as always: As soon as the outside barrier is silent, a sort of fantastic calm from an earlier paradise with a petrol range smell expands in it.
"What happens here is an ecological struggle," says Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
War comparison takes place.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a sparkling battlefield for years: Here the first European explorers broke over 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to place his first factory Shell Consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today it is forbidden the return of companies to Ogonilandia: While they pumped daily more than two million barrels of black gold from the whole delta region, three times larger than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometers of pipeline, the oil fields in Ogonilandia were quiet, the location is too unstable for then.
Each two hundred meters highlighted steel platforms such as sculptures of water: "Christmas trees" were affectionately called the heads of the perforators.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
Each moment a head fails, says Akpobari, then runs a constant jet of oil in the water.
According to expert reviews, more than two billion liters have been poured into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the 21-year-old ship's "Exxon Valdez" accident in the Alaska Sea, one of the biggest ecological catastrophes in humanity history.
Anyone who is responsible for the lasting environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell’s consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see heads about to break and pipes with leaks as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies conventional standards normally in the world, scientist Richard Steiner reproached the consortium in 2008: Only pipe defect rates are “over a multiple greater than elsewhere.”
In one place, which seems from far away forgotten, a workshop full of oil appears under the free sky, figures arise from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes bound to perforations, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, flames a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, oil is heated in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the group’s chief.
First, the gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the container, later the oil pipe drops and ultimately leaves diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300-liter diesel daily: "It brings us 34,000 naira", about $22.
Inhabitants of the Delta take advantage of fuel shortage in one of the largest oil states in Black Africa.
Nigeria only has a single refinery.
With the absurd and cheap diesel price of just 40 euros-cent per liter, illegal heaters can offer even less: thus they reduce the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", who tricked the pipe network that crosses Ogonilandia: According to experts, at this step at least 16 million liters of oil are lost daily throughout the Niger delta.
Only an insignificant part of the stored provisional premium material is clearly refined illegally: organized criminal networks, to which also belong politicians and senior military offices, keep the best part in aljibs and sell it cheap in the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers purely academic the debate about whether environmental disaster is rather due to the handling of the population or the loose way of production.
“If the oil stations did not behave as invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, nor illegal refineries.”
While the conditions of the ogonis are destroyed above all by Shell to the point that only one deduction appears from the consortium: “Perhaps it’s better to present another nationality, such as China.”
Michael gets nervous.
“It’s time for you to disappear,” says the musculous Ölmann.
"The soldiers can come at any minute."
If the special unit of the army takes the illegal refiners, don’t threaten to arrest them, if not with a painful bribe.
Soldiers coming from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of raw material.
“This condemned invention has completely broken our country in pieces,” says Akpobari.
Researchers detect hazardous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a huge security problem.
In a research of a machine that carried out a forced landing, the researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine."
Qantas airline wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Airbus passengers from Qantas who made an emergency landing in early November were much more lucky than you can imagine: Australian air security authorities perceived a major safety problem in some A380 engines thanks to their investigations, and warn of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated effects: In a sleeves connection, fatigue or cracks can be caused, ATBS authorities announced in a report published Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic failure in the engine."
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among the Qantas-Airbus was a forced landing on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian airline has launched legal averages against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in the federal court of Sydney that allowed further legal measures against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, said his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the engine brand they have lost parts and their wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers announced that they will conduct further safety tests to superjumbs equipped with affected engines.
The security recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, ATSB spokesman.
The security problem has become important enough to inform all those affected.
After the Qantas apparatus’ emergency landing, the airline kept its A380 fleet on land for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept approximately three of its eleven A380 temporarily on land.
Lufthansa resumed the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-covered aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
A Nevada across the country causes chaos in traffic
Germany fully white: From one day to another has snowned almost all over the country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Ice winter Germany: Nearly all the country cold temperatures were reached during Thursday night, which has triggered chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a 15-inch thick snow layer.
Traffic is very limited in most highways and in many streets.
At the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the fleeting snows are ongoing, removing the new snow again and again, but is not prepared.
Furthermore, strong wind rails barren the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects living tides with water levels 1.2 meters above its usual level on the coast of the Baltic Sea Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony, snow accumulation caused considerable problems on highways and national roads.
According to the Meteomedia weather service, the red alert in Sachsische Schweiz is called, actually the highest alert.
There is partly 30 centimeters of freshly fallen snow and cold and strong winds take care of removing it.
There were many trucks and cars stuck overnight.
Also in Saxony Anhalt, police authorities reported major disorders in the streets.
In the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created clutches.
In Turingia snowfall affected A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disorders are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Turingia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, trees dropped on the lanes or destroyed cathenary, and holes are the main problems.
The interurban service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended in Saxony.
In Saafeld, Turingia an ICE train had to stop his trip to Munich.
The firefighters and rescue service served all 165 passengers on the train with wool blankets, food and drink.
Wind with snow barren the streets.
At the largest German airport, snow winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokesman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokesman for Fraport, there are already 40 flights canceled.
Snows are continuously operating.
However, there are few passengers stabbed at the airport, despite that there are 400 campaign beds prepared for them.
In many streets, Wednesday afternoon there were many accidents already.
In the afternoon, a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a crossroads in Ostholstein.
The machinerist suffered mild wounds.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg, a similar accident occurred because of the snow streets: Also here a truck was reached on a crossroads because the vehicle was drained.
The driver lost his life.
In the train, four passengers were injured, the tour from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after taking a return with her car near Aschaffenburg on a sparkling road.
Meteorologists have a good news: The snow will be increasingly smoother and powder-like, and therefore it will burst in soft cracks.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 negative degrees.
Deusche Bank seeks a buyer for its twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution seeks buyer for its office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Recently Deutschen Bank arranged its headquarters: Twin towers were modernized in the neighborhood of Frankfurt banks; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium seems to take advantage of the costs of renovation, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" says based on a spokesman.
The spokesman does not name the reasons for the sale in the project.
"We always check whether it is appropriate to own or sell the properties and then rent them again," he said.
That’s why Germany’s largest credit institution resumes its company’s headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in the middle of 2007 for EUR 272 million from the investor of a house fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached approximately EUR 200 million.
A sale would make a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this area calculate the value of the newspaper’s towers renamed as “Greentowers” in about €500 million.
If renovated buildings are sold on a bank fund or to an independent investor has not yet been revealed, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people in mourning for the deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of buried miners, who died after many explosions in a mine.
However, the corpses have not been found, because security measures remain precarious in the place of unfortunateness.
Nearly two weeks ago, an intense explosion took place at the Pike River mine near Greymouth City.
29 miners aged 17 to 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced in the place of misfortune, but discovered no signals of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment could drop for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts deducted that there was no chance that the miners would have survived.
The bodies have not been recovered so far.
Family and friends are currently reminded of the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the bright sunshine in Greymouth on the Southern New Zealand island.
They keep silence for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal items, underneath clothes and surf boards.
The flags waved half in front of the country’s government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that miners would return to the surface “from the depths of the earth,” New Zealand government president John Key told the participants of the commemorative act.
"But never returned home."
He cannot assume the death of his son until he has seen his body, Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the family of the victims participated in the commemorative act many foreign diplomats.
In the first explosion on November 19, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began extinguying a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, burning temperatures from the interior of the mine will begin to drop, police senior Gary Knowles told journalists.
The hell, warrior!
Does the gore fit in the artistic film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-explores the borders of the genre with his epopey of battles "Walhalla Rising".
Which audience would Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think about when he plays "Walhalla Rising"?
A single-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees his torturers and kills his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sound ideal for young spectators seeking bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and remove his enemies from their bodies alive when it is in bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, says almost any word throughout the film and the other characters are left to be carried out by how much one or two sentences or a pair of harsh deadly screams.
Otherwise they are silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountainous landscapes of Scotland, which the frames offer the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown and interested filmmakers in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a movie has several groups of recipients, it is a shame that cannot be dismissed from each other.
Director Winding Refn considers his wild and trilogy about drug dealer hairstyle "Pusher" as a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with some more humor in the main current or some less brutality of the artistic house.
A brain mass and triples that spring up cannot dissuade most followers of the artistic cinema.
Most fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and an eternity remains stuck in calm and fog before his team arrives in America and silences there again.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only released on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody facade, a piece of sometimes exciting movie is hidden, which deserves some attention.
This movie does not deal with dialogues or a logic action, everything is atmosphere, a febril dream transformed into a movie.
That’s why there’s no escape for the spectators.
Refn counts just a moment of relaxation and his glacier images, and the lugure trance soundtrack makes him a knot in his throat, especially the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes to him.
Only a young blonde, who faithfully supports Unojo, retains something like innocence, all the others are possessed by anger.
Especially, the hero of one eye, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for provisional enemies and allies, possibly in the ambassador of the same devil.
He represents perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious movie that can be hated and admired, angry, altered and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious Earth Movements
The IAEA nuclear energy organization has new signs of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country rejects opinion on this topic until controls are allowed.
About the midnight of 5-6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the banks of Euphrates; the largest and closest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), dealing with a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley leaving the river.
According to the CIA’s U.S. International Intelligence Service in late April 2008, a current reactor is designed under the name of the proximity of the Kibar very suitable for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
Instead, the technique only serves for other purposes than for the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with deleted satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the components of the reactor were before destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from nearby or from inside.
The reactor was running for a short time, he says, but was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years later of the bombing, it is barely more known than at the time, the enigmas became greater over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that before the attack the CIA was totally sure that the Syrians had built a reactor in the Kibar, but that he barely saw indications that there was “a nuclear weapons program in the country.”
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only talk about a "submitted reactor", although they consider the presentation of the CIA "plausible".
There is a lack of solid evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how sure it was to have a reactor ahead, a senior UN diplomat responded in summer in a stone manner that the IAEA "has enough material to have questions."
The Syrians disappeared very quickly from the debris of the alleged "unused military building" and threatened the ground to consciousness.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in the Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
The IAEA also obtained satellite images of a member state from trade vendors just after the attack, who must have a greater information value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not arrive on the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always understood that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
Uranium was from Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as inveronymous after particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss this, just like with regard to satellite images.
In addition, the controllers are prohibited from a second inspection in the Kibar and from entering the ruins of the bombarded building.
Israel also keeps a strict silence.
"We will never comment," Ehud Olmert, prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not resulted since June 2008 and "progressively turned into a serious credibility issue for authorities," as a senior Western diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, finally a serious violation of the Atomic Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty, which the IAEA ensures.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in clarification, which must be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
Inspectors have not until the moment publicly announced what teams they are dealt with, what functions they have, or whether they seem suspicious.
According to Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated as internal Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from the proximity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) identified these places and located a building complex near Masyaf with satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspected objects.
It is probably located in or immediately next to a military base, with this reason Syria prohibits entry to the three places to the IAEA.
In Vienna, Syrians are afraid of a record that the U.S. has asked the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were warned about the teams thanks to U.S. secret service warnings.
Through satellite photographs, the IAEA has indications that material moves between the three seats and the cube on the banks of the Eufrates.
A Western diplomat with a high office in Vienna said at least one of the equipment may be “related to fuel production.”
But there is no "indication of sensitive activities," neither of uranium enrichment nor of re-conditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is actuated with uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where the plutonium for bombs should subsequently be separated, for these central questions there are plausible assumptions in the best case.
There is no doubt about whether the ruins, the valuable tracks that can recover, are in all three places.
As the hundreds of loads of the floor trucks disappeared, no one has information about where the debris remains.
The OIAE considers unlikely the al-Tibni salt mine, located within a few kilometers from the Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for their aptitude as a zone for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, related her to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But photographs from the orbit show that the Syrians carried out land movements in the three suspected places and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It can be a chance, but it barely helps to dissipate the suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector, it is said that the IAEA has used several months to develop an inspection plan there, which Syrians would allow, to maintain the possible military secret, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damascus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter has not been very urgent, for a couple of months, Glyn Davies, a type of U.S. ambassador, strikes so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the IAEA director, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of “an option that I am open to in the future,” but still empty.
This path is very risky: to do so, most of the IAEA’s governing council is needed, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not precisely anxious for an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat thought, "What happens if they finally don't find anything?"
Love in the times of war
There are problems since Angelina Jolie began in summer with the address of her debut yet unnamed.
She herself has written the script, a love story between a Bosnia and a Serb.
Not much more is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavia War.
Bosnian women’s associations have quickly protested, with which in the last moment they transferred a few days of planned shooting in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the female organization of war victims wrote to UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, by Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
It’s not diplomatic, weeks ago women offered her a meeting in Hungary that she rejected.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
No love stories are given in the rape camps, and Jolie's position about it deletes the victims enough about the script.
Her organization in accordance with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended to resign Jolie as a ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly has Jolie written for the scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture that read the script, granted after a strip and released a recording permit in Sarajevo, is unclear why Jolie was not despite all.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, is introduced with much effort in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give voice to all parties involved.
Its content is still inaccurate.
In the network circulates a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: Lovers were together before the beginning of the war and meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnia, is deported to a Serbian field where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "rape victim is in love with torture."
It’s sure that Jolie’s movie really starts before the war.
The pressure on it, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on wrong information.”
They can currently achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script remains on the network illegally, as many others previously.
Nothing as far away from here
This afternoon it is finally good again for the Irish people.
No trace of affliction
Instead, the home team dominates its customers from Sweden, Finland and the US.
Fans cry out of joy as they turn up the loud music, hit the ground with their feet.
Bailey club vibrates in the Southern Cork, because players launch, and find pingpong balls to beer glasses from a three-meter distance.
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus one plane tickets to Las Vegas for the world beerpong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this strassy drinking game and the discreet computer actually do not make good mice.
And the 26-year-old is trying to have fun with that, distracting himself from the fulminating question, what will bring him up for the future.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in its plans, in January it will take a personal interview in New Zealand.
“I have a bad feeling,” he says.
"It's far away from home and I still have no work there."
At least: His girlfriend waiting for him in Auckland, "from a shot he managed his dreams as an event manager, perhaps it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to the bad outlook at home, two of Tanners’ three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, his brother Colin currently works as IT advisor in Londres.
Young people leave: There are many families like the Tanners on the island.
100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the near future, forecast economic experts and the Dublin ESRI Social Research Institute.
By 2015, 200,000 migrants have been counted.
A huge loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, a migration wave comes comparable to which the island suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, today melancholy extends.
The economic crisis confuses above all the young, well-trained Irish people, for whom so far, everything is upward.
The loss of employment and the social decline seemed absurd in the years of the boom.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young migrants who complain that: "In Ireland everything sinks."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever can, goes away and loses our country and thereby a whole generation.”
"The last one that closes the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and chairman of the Irish students’ union, sees a dark future appearing because the government is dedicated only to mounting and no longer offers future prospects to young people.
“They reduce minimum wages, but they don’t have strategies to achieve new jobs,” the 20-year-old girl says.
Note how your colleagues go from unrecognized practices to the following.
Their biggest concern, he explains, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
“For those who begin to work, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to run your career,” the manager says.
On his website, photos of a boy surfing in Australia and another snowboarding in Canada are shown.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleries, but carrying freedom and fun.
For half a year, Sean O'Donovan knows how it is to build something elsewhere.
Since there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
They now create a fashion shop in Gelsenkirchen.
In January we will go to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only few times because he works extra hours to be able to pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
“The situation is a little crazy,” he says, as long ago from the first time he stamped the threshold of his house.
"Get money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
It laughs a bit embarrassed and goes for freezing rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with garden care in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house along with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 per hundred funded by a credit.
“They were crazy times, there was easy money without many questions,” he says.
Are you afraid to fail with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from zero."
The civil engineer doesn’t like complaints he listens often to now.
“No one should be hungry, our situation is not, in a lot of difference, as dramatic as in the past times here on the island,” he said.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, perhaps with it we felt Irish for the first time."
He laughs and tells him about his father, who in the last big economic crisis he went to England.
“After seven years returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple.”
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave up the future and simply see what life is elsewhere.
He worked for a couple of years in London, and why wouldn’t he and his girlfriend in New Zealand go well?
But in these days there is one thing that worrys you overwhelmingly: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
Fears I can degenerate at a farewell party.
"Just, not too many emotions," he says and gives a great drink to his beer.
"Free, it sounds very annoying."
"We call it a march party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The Democratic Routine
It continues to increase support for democracy in Latin America as well as support for private companies.
Crime causes greater concern than unemployment.
In addition, much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it allows for monitoring attitude changes in the region.
In the results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October, two related issues highlight.
The first is the relatively animated humor in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% annually since 2002, democracy support has increased from reduced 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It grew also in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a great decline in production last year.
However, only half of the surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populated countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which reduces the regional average (see graph 2).
About 44% of respondents in the region declared satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably higher than 25% recorded in 2001 (Chart 3).
About 34% claimed that they trusted their country’s Congress and 45% in their government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turbulences in Latin America seriously affected support for democracy.
The fact that it had remained during the global financial crisis was probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Furthermore, the existence of a stronger social security network has contributed to protecting the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only increased marginally in 2009 and that it has decreased again this year, up to 32 percent.)
However, the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see Chart 4).
Brazil’s good economic yields and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a general feeling of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where recession was more serious and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the surveys began, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, instead of unemployment, as the most serious problem your country faces (see graph 5).
About 31% claim that, whether they or a nearby relative, they have been the victim of crime in the last year, a figure that has been reduced since 38% last year and that is the lowest percentage recorded since 1995.
Most positive economic yields are reflected in greater support for private enterprises and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region claim that private enterprises are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56% (see graph 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow your country to develop, compared to 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela think the same (and 80% support private companies), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country that exercises greater leadership in the region, as indicates 19% of respondents (from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% versus 11% one year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela has such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to the Waste
No one expected that the general elections held on November 28 in Haiti would be perfect.
However, they happened much worse than the foreigners who were afraid trying to help the country go back after their problems.
Votes were introduced in the urns, some people voted several times, paperboards thrown in the cantarillas, destroyed electoral schools and intimidation acts.
Electoral schools opened with hours of delay.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, walked around the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them, at the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, reported fraud and requested the cancellation of the elections.
The protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the top-range United Nations official in Haiti, stated that they were “a relatively good election in many ways.”
The observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that “we do not consider these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and with its candidate, Jude Celestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7th.
The decomposition is expected to take place in January.
All hopes for elections have not yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial request in which they requested the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority states that Mr. Celestin, who has hardly supported, if any, has passed to the second round.
Considering that the cholera epidemic breaks the country and more than a million of the earthquake survivors remain in tents, a great abstention is expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents, needed to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Assistance donors believe the election of a legitimate and popular government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as it has been clear, the Haitians themselves think so too.
Advanced points towards the center
In the weeks that have passed since she lost her husband Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity rate by 20 points, to over 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
Nevertheless, that it can become a successful campaign for a second term in the elections of the next year will depend on whether the clearly affected Ms. Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to take over economic policy even after his wife succeeded as president, had the custom of drawing up budgets undervaluing tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend additional income at its discretion.
In theory, the government of Ms. Fernández lost her majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner’s death due to a heart attack on October 27.
Some discording members of the Peronist movement in power have faced Mrs. Fernández.
However, after chaotic sessions in which one member hit another on his face and other members accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to discuss," the president said.
Consequently, the 2010 budget will apply for the next year, which will offer the president an even greater action margin in spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to union wage requirements, place it nearly 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who assumed power in 2003 when Argentina was on the edge of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction be its priorities, instead of controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressed the private sector and made the INDEC, the Institute of Statistics, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernandez now modify these policies?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and the leaders of trade unions.
In addition, officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports worldwide.
However, inflation has limited the boost to growth achieved with a great devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for the reason Mrs. Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina’s financial bonds with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had denied prior forced restructuring of the debt Argentina had not paid in 2001.
Today, it seems that Ms. Fernández is about to hold an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, which owes around $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not imply IMF supervision, as usual.
Last month, however, the Minister of Economics, Amado Boudou, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new index of domestic consumption prices, which seems the prelude to the cleaning of the INDEC.
It is unclear whether President Fernández wants to continue in politics when she ends her mandate, taking into account that she no longer has her husband on her side.
If you do so, you will need to gain support from the middle class, much of which you have tired of kirchnerism.
When the Argentinians return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for it will have fallen.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether you reject or not, in peace, many of your husband’s policies.
Middle Hurra for China
Taiwan voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What do Taiwan think about his great brother on the other side of the narrow?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of eligible voters, went on November 27 to choose mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what seems to be a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a defender of feelings for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest changes in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but for a little bit.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the five mayor elections, he failed to obtain the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (PPD), which has inclined for a total independence from Taiwan, obtained virtually 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If they were the presidential, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, the proportion of his party’s votes has decreased by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD engaged with the KMT in the municipalities.
In the elections, the typical elements of the Taiwan elections were able to see, including noisy trucks and large agglomerations with bandits and light clothing girls dancing.
Neither did the mysterious attempt to murder rigor.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, Honorary President of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the elections.
A crowd man shot the young man directly in his face, hurting him and killing a transit.
The curious thing is that it was not able to determine whether the man wanted to hurt Lien or revenge the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the PPD leader, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to lean for the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that it was not the matter of the continent itself.
Instead, candidates talked about public accommodation plans and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threat.
Therefore, the KMT often avoid advertising its ties with the government in Beijing.
But this time the PPD also avoided encouraging the feeling against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan’s economic survival.
Mr Ma, for his part, said that his policy regarding China had been confirmed to be acceptable for most Taiwans.
The Government of Beijing is expected to continue subsidizing them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the trade.
China did not waste time by sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
No doubt, you would also like to achieve political integration, but the first thing is the first thing.
The best thing is to wait until the 2012 presidential election takes place for this.
In any case, the PPD has reinvented itself.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned accused of corruption.
The President between 2000 and 2008 openly urged explicit independence.
However, under Ms. Tsai’s leadership, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been gratefully welcomed as a PPD candidate for the presidency, as well as Su Tseng-chang, who fulfilled a mandate under Chen.
Now his party is doing every effort to prove that he can also have relationships with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced the plans for establishing a group of experts to act as a contact point between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations can be carried out without prior conditions.
Mrs. Tsai tells the Taiwan public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's precipitated approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PPD candidates would have been better stopped if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to present the presidential offices.
Even without Mr. Chen interceding, the PPD will have difficulty choosing among its potential candidates.
The KMT must also do a consciousness exam.
Mr. Ma's ratings have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Their lack of popularity seems primarily due to unemployment and growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says he will restructure his cabinet as well as local teams.
The large samples of the PPD suggest that Taiwan’s support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwans believe economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, “the point of non-return has already crossed.”
Grammy nominations: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of Revelation Artist.
He acts at the request of a president and possibly people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to act at his Nobel Peace Award ceremony in 2009, represented one of the Grammy’s surprises this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Revelation Artist.
Taking into account that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, “Hopefulness,” the nomination gives what to think, but respects the Grammy norms according to which it must be an artist who has not brought more than three albums to the market before recording the one that “determines that artist’s public identity.”
Their ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", was undoubtedly a great advance and, taking into account its light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with influences of pop, funk and Latin rhythms, you can at least establish a distinction between Spalding and the path towards the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the nearest equier for the Gram.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters fairly honored "History" by Vijay Iyer Trio, an exciting and magnificent album that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer’s competitors is veteran saxophonist James Moody with “Moody 4B” and cyclist John Beasley with “Positootly”.
Trombone Shorty, a favorite strident in New Orleans and usual guest in "Treme", from HBO, was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest is dramatically inclined towards the merger as in Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild punk of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society won a deserved recognition in the category of large groups, competing against Billy Childs Ensemble's great camera jazz and the ever-risk Dave Holland, whose live album with his octeto, "Pathways", was a great example of the democratic leadership of the bassist in his band.
Nominations to Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in better direction of classic albums
Nominations in classical music for the 53th edition of the Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", for piano and five-movement orchestra, and Steve Mackey for "Dreamhouse", a work for three-movement eclectic orchestra.
Among the nominees with links to southern California are Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and released at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concert.
Classic music nominations are distributed in 13 categories that include albums of orchestra, opera, coral and solo.
The classic producer category of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classic musical album are Bruckner for the Symphonys No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Orchestra Concertgebouw; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Symphony Orchestra de Nashville; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra - VoSagy
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg by "Lulu" of the Royal Opera House orchestra; Adolf Orchedrin by "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho by "The Love of Aloin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester; and Rodion Shchedrin by "The Enchant or Wander"
The composers nominated to a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassonately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was released at Disney Hall in January 2009 at a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, approximately 30 minutes, is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the old oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated by instrumental solitary performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically to play the mandoline Avi Avital, who played the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"It composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
85-year-old director Pierre Boulez was nominated in the category of orchestra function, for directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and arpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for his recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula obtains approval from the Order Committee
The mosque project for Temecula has obtained unanimous support from the local ordering committee after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project saying it encourages terrorism and seizure.
However, the members of the commission decided Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be impressive from aesthetic point of view.
“Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Baha’i, of all religions,” said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
“The truth is that, as a American citizen, I am proud.”
"It demonstrates that justice prevails."
“The opposition is really minimal,” he adds.
“They only speak very loud.”
“In this valley there are wonderful people.”
The meeting began at six o'clock in the afternoon and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time was dedicated to people who interceded in favor or against the center, almost the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“The United States no longer exists,” he reads in one of the comments.
“This is another Planet of the Apes with Ms. Liberty dead in the sand.”
"America has fallen."
Plans for building Islamic centers have also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero zone, the New York area where the attacks of September 11, 2011 occurred.
In Temecula Valley, Magnet Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His nearly 135-family congregation has been seamlessly living in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse he rented in a shared property with a manufacturer of water filtering systems.
The new 24,943 square feet mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and lift up to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal to the project to the Municipal Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it proves that there are possible forms of life without the main elements they considered essential.
“This body has a double capacity.”
"It can grow with phosphorus or arsenic."
“This makes it something very peculiar, although little is missing to be a really ‘alien’ type of lifestyle,” said Paul C. W. Davies from Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears on Thursday’s online edition of Science.
For a long time, there are six major elements that are essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have discovered that the bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing the phosphorus with arsenic.
"It makes you wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar from Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
As Anbar said, the find is important for the search for life on different planets than Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, know how it looks.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated great speculation on the Internet about the possibility of the report to indicate the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery shows is that in other planetary environments, there may be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of “standard” elements that we consider to be indispensable for life may not be so fixed,” said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University at Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
“This work is novel because it demonstrates the replacement of one element by another in biochemistry and basic biochemistry structure,” Cockell added.
The discovery was not done by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA’s astrobiology institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because he has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace each other.
“Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to phosphorus.”
"Consequently, it can be complicated for organisms to differentiate them."
“However, the arsenic is different enough to not work as well as the phosphorus, so it enters and, in some way, appeals the biochemical machinery,” Anbar explains.
The researchers collected bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they managed to adapt and used to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but demonstrating that it can live with arsenic instead poses the possibility that naturally a form of life that uses arsenic may exist, whether in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where the arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an auxiliary professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that arsenic can be replaced with phosphorus is not new, but an example has never been found to prove it works.
Arsenic was more common in the early eras of Earth, he said, so researchers speculated that the first forms of life may have used it.
“Yes, it suggests that there might be other ways to generate life, not only the way life formed on Earth formerly,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Stolen dogs missing in Compton have been found
The two dogs missing from the four stolen in front of the Bellflower Motel have been found, officials of Los Angeles County Sheriff said Thursday.
The four competing dogs, two Akitas and two Wales Corgi Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck in which they were spending the night, in front of the Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the dogs recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two met on Wednesday late night, Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff department, said.
“The good news is that dogs are fine,” Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
“They have come back with their legitimate owners.”
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
“An investigation is being carried out.”
“We don’t want to say anything,” Whitmore said.
"We're following some tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, couldn’t be found to make any comments on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a three-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not suffered damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek wanted to exhibit at the area’s competitions this week on behalf of Japanese dog owners, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and were intended to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs were going to exhibit them in other competitions planned for the days before the AKC/Eukanuba championship, as Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops in the almost two-month tour that the couple takes part in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of the window of your room.
They brought three other dogs (a boxer child, a terrier Parson Russell and a Brittany), who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick hair and would be fresher.
They left windows slightly open so that dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van on Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday it was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to ruin again, while the restructuring of MGM gets final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally achieved green light to start again.
On Thursday, a New York federal bankruptcy judge officially approved the "prearmed" plan by creditors to erase about $5 billion in debt, leading the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and launching movies and television shows.
Thursday’s ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to resume under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main executives of what will be a reduced study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a $500 million planned credit instrument to finance the new MGM’s operations and productions.
The investment bank is currently trade-unioning the credit, which is on its own contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded in mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to provide advice on the management necessary to order its finances, while struggling to be able to make interest payments for $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and expert in bankruptcy business recovery, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to solve MGM’s financial tribulations and satisfy the more than 140 study creditors, required much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, by the end of 2009 the parties agreed to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few posters and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion that the creditors were looking for.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table while the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally supported by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially leaves bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-billion bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will get a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which have been raising $375,000 a month for their company’s management services, will receive a $4 million “success honoraries”.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one movie this year, and gathered an annual board of seven or eight movies that will be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The study needs to agree to a separate loan of $265 to $275 million to fund its part of the two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM’s debt, had been trying to fix a merger of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to maintain the balance of your gift budget
While the iPad is the leading candidate to be the most wonderful toy this year, followed by perhaps the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both may mean a significant slightness in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can purchase five BMX bikes of $99 each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes adorned with accounts, or about 48 Play-Doh cans.
But there are ways to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three domestic toy vendors, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see what electronic toys could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that the Moore Law has been working; this year’s technological toy will probably have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year’s.
Furthermore, while there are usually fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the best known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And toys driven by button batteries are increasing, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are of Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and older) are peluche toys of the size of a cowboy that sing a note when their barrels are tightened.
A press equals a note, and a second press begins to arrange a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start to press, you cannot stop.
For singing combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and older) is the best option.
Borrowing from Elmo Live’s last year’s technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn exchange games like Simón Dice, and can make the lunar passage, thanks to its innovative feet articulated with wheels with lock-up device.
Children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained for the lack of volume control.
If you are a child in the 1980s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of question letters designed to turn a car ride into a session with an occurring self-correct exercise notebook.
If you’re afraid to give your child your smartphone, here you’ll find three independent alternatives.
VTech’s MobiGo ($60, 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, 3 to 12 years old), is the first important set up of the Leapster line, with a new and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90, 3 to 7 years old) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a five-block game just bigger than a brick box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to arm words by placing the blocks in row before the time is over; it is formidable for a word-armed improvised competition.
There are increasingly the toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toys, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online at the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, (5 dollars, 6 to 12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you exchange the online code, your child gets enough credits from the Penguin Club store for two items.
These could include wheel skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly bigger than the pig of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and older) is the latest on a line of microrobots driven by button batteries.
The false insect moves quickly over 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.
It’s fun to make a block labyrinth to see if you can find the output.
It is also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend a while inside the mouth of our dog.
More moderate side of order maintenance is promoted in China
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the step in a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people at his office, emitting low voice orders with military authority.
He wanted the feminine members of Chengguan, the police of the urban order of China, feared and despised by their capricious energetic measures and their inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Firms!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "How are the beautiful girls!"
Four girls who barely passed adolescence with identical white gloves and olive green jackets and tight pants to draw attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed above the hair tied with blue and white stripes.
"Personally, I think they have a normal appearance," Mr. Tang said disgustingly.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to clean the image of Chinese urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree degree.
The Guangdong Province changed the grey green colour of uniforms to an allegedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced the use of force by intimidatory eyes: in 2009, a report said, 50 officers surrounded a snack cart, and watched it with the constantly fruited cranium for half an hour, until the ambulant seller collected his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has added to its urban police officers 13 women, expressly chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the cocktail a softer, female side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to struggle to increase China's tiny respect for these city squads.
And for a good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city orders, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei Province inspectors killed a transit after using their cell phone to film them while dissolving a protest against a waste landfill.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the internet, in which it was described as effectively striking criminals without bleeding.
This year, a Shanghai-based sandwich salesman suffered brain damage after a five-office kidney.
A video game full of violence, available to download online, presents Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
“Chengguan has left a scar in the government,” China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after another controversy on tactics.
The newspaper required “a truly meticulous cleaning.”
Skepticians say the current approach is far from this.
After the district applied for eight new female recruits in October, an editorial at The Beijing Evening News wondered whether women had real duties or were simply a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district warning requested female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial traits."
They should have a height above the average, above 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retreat at the age of 26 is mandatory.
The officials said work was physically too hard for women over 25 years old.
“Your image is the important thing,” an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial traits, etc.
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities".
Female Chengguans are like flowers, he said, and added, “Besides being flowers, they will have other responsibilities.”
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the District City Administration Office, is not looking forward to supporting that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standards in many Chinese work warnings for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means being agreed, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not appear.
“We can’t let a catch or a jorn come to work here,” Mr. Zheng said.
“His image wouldn’t be fine.”
Liu Yi, who patrols the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his colored cheeks and a subtlely curved mouth.
She doesn’t believe that the accent in her appearance is sexistic, she said.
“You think I look sexy with this uniform?” he asked with a sardic look.
His 21-year-old partner Xu Yang said, “Our work must present the picture of the city.”
They also oppose their work on time, they said, because they have older career ambitions that simply flee vendors in the streets where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squadron faces more or less a dozen riding vendors who are launching on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many pans or tofu bowls as possible before being thrown.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
“We’ve told you a lot of times!” said Miss Xu as a seller escaped on foot, temporarily leaving his bicycle-dropped car with fide garnisons.
The officers describe their duties as more monotone than exhaustive.
“This is more or less the same every day,” said Huang Jing, 20-year-old, who study marketing in his free hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the merchandise of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report offencers to their men’s supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of enemy against bureaucracy, which are common everywhere in China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, were mocked after the false rumors were scattered that some Chengguan officials had killed a seller.
More than a dozen police officers or Chengguan officers were wounded in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were overturned or fired.
For the moment, Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is barely guaranteed.
Only two streets from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people met in a corner.
The officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired in the steel rather than in a workshop, as required by the regulation.
The motorcycle owner shouted hardly.
The situation was stained for 15 minutes before the officers, with bad face, opened a step to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and their owner.
40-year-old Li Xuedong, a coordinator assigned to the male squad, remained behind, with his white label given round to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men 40 or older, play a purely supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
“Sometimes we struggle verbally.”
"Sometimes we struggle physically," Mr. Li said with total naturality.
“Most of the time is the audience that starts the fight.”
Prosecutors will not make charges against Senator Ensign
The senator’s lawyers announced Wednesday that the Justice Department’s prosecutors have excused Senator John Ensign for criminal charges arising from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure work through lobby for his wife’s husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal about his affair had national holders last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said it felt "surely happy" for the decision, which came after an entire year investigation.
The Senator could still face a disciplinary action of the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign’s lawyers said the Department of Justice had “informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer an objective of his investigation and that he has no plan to lift charges against him for this issue.”
The Department of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have confessed to violate a federal criminal ban on lobby.
Interviews, email and other documents released first in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get lucrative work through lobby, to achieve Hampton’s silence and his wife, Cynthia, about the Senator’s affair with her.
Ms. Hampton once worked as a treasurer of a Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr. Hampton and advocated on behalf of them after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an Ensign assistant, he was excluded under the law of making lobby for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared in disagreement with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict former state employees using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, “it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the status of revolving door,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specializing in defending customers investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical attorneys said the department seemed cautious when accepting political proceedings after several important reverses for his section of public integrity, including last year's decision to leave the proceedings against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduit.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
“This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that laws don’t apply to them,” he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's lead attorney, said in an interview he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and another call more the next day, saying the department did not want to raise charges against his client.
Ensign’s defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in attempting to persuade them that the Senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, “he acted in accordance with the law.”
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to the prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable to get into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation in a complaint separated by the ethics group, claiming that a payment of $96,000 from Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated the federal election law.
The electoral committee said it had not enough evidence to prove that money was just a gift.
NV Energy is an important Nevada company that had long supported the senator, which managed to work through lobby thanks to the help Ensign gave to Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's head of office John Lopez communicated with Hampton and told him that he was "making" the Ministry of Interior on a question in dispute.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretary to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign asked for forgiveness to his voters and resigned to his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told journalists that he planned to apply for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, announced Ensign was no longer the subject of criminal investigation, he said the senator expected the ethics committee to quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and conclude his investigation.
"Senator Ensign wants to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire’s appeal will point to Twitter
There was half a dozen of them "shocking" in the rows of the court room.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the amazing testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed the rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was fired.
On Thursday, the proceedings widely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was sentenced for the murder of three members of a Cheshire family, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official end, with the imposition of the judge of the death penalty voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have submitted writings to the court that delineate the arguments of appeals that probably will occupy to the courts for years.
One of the most provocative states that intense reports on the process, including the wide use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created "a circus atmosphere", and such widespread and immediate saturation with exalting details made public passions exert inappropriate influence on the jury.
The complaint could force appeal judges to deal with the question of whether new technology requires new rules in the court room.
“According to what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the court room is affecting the individual’s rights to have a fair process,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes’ chief defense lawyer.
First-instance judge Jon C. Blue, of the State High Court, laconicly rejected the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying the news media were “cautiously controlled” and there was no evidence that the jury has been taken by passion.
But it will probably not be the last word on the topic.
For decades, appeal courts have acknowledged that celebrity case coverage can cause questions about the impartiality of a proceedings.
In a 1966 historic ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court revoked the sentence of an osteopath in Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the case of Sheppard vs. Maxwell, that there was "an atmosphere of carnival in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that appeal courts who examined Mr. Hayes’ condemnation half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be necessary to control the form of communication from the court rooms, something unthinkable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
“There is a general reason for concern about the impact of new media” on high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford School of Laws, who studied Connecticut’s death penalty and wrote a report that said this was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appeal judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from the court rooms could make trials more fair.
The question of Twitter is just one of many issues outlined by Hayes’ lawyers, which will probably be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense lawyers also say, for example, that Hayes might have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jury, showing them stunning photographs of the crime scene during the jury’s selection.
Some jurys have said they were horrified by the pictures of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit, and their daughters, Hayley, 17-year-old and 11-year-old Michaela.
Defense lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized the prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pressed for a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate for a weekend.
The jury was not kidnapped.
But his arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a refusal to the verdict archived last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media continued to throw wood into the fire of emotion over the case.
“The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the court,” the lawyers wrote, “it was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps throughout the state.”
Your attention on Tweeter’s coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said the complaint about the fact that immediate news was more important than reports delivered more slowly, was a ludic vision that would make the court’s policy on coverage control weak in future proceedings.
But some lawyers said the appeal courts often felt attracted by the arguments about the adaptation required in courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In his writing, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which revoked Dr. Sheppard’s conviction due to the coverage of the proceedings, and made clear that they would require new media to require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represented the case Sheppard vs. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can Civism tender a bridge to unite the divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invictive and negativity, this week a little civism has been triggered in Washington.
Is it a preach of a genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusorian moment before a quick turn to the partisan fight in the capital?
The meeting between President Obama and Congress leaders on Tuesday did not produce any progress on the big issues to be dealt with during the outgoing session.
But as everyone says, it was at least a courteous discussion about the differences of the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to win partisan points.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the president’s deficit commission was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that exceeds the ideological gap that still separates members.
That's just enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both sides are now in a test period, surveying each other to identify signs of cooperativism and commitment, while trying to assess the boundaries of public opinion and voters’ patience for a renewed partisan warfare.
Reason for which the meeting on Tuesday and subsequent assessments by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and are very deeply rooted to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it comes to taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, both parties are in opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
“There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to how to say things,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
“They are inevitable after the elections.
Elections awaken supporting passions, which are then extinguished.
That's good."
In some matters, particularly those listed in the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax reductions are winning at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment grants, probably because Republicans cannot believe they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, deniing unemployment grant for unemployed.
After the White House meeting on Tuesday, there is greater optimism for a possible deal with these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START nuclear disarmament treaty (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institute, warns that successful cooperation in the urgent issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continuous bipartisanity when the new 112th Congress gathers in January.
He said, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable, that a period of disagreement begins.
“After things to be done are carried out, psychology will return the situation to a confrontation in the short term,” he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civism can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as an essay for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and voters of the Tea Party, which decisively contributed to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders have awareness of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they must try to meet their promises to cut state expenses and cancel the new health law.
These supporting lines are already clearly observed in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, including the reform of the tax code and the increase in some taxes and retirement age, and the expenditure cut.
Co-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken care of one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have brought the issue of deficit in the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the commission of 18 members to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the officials elected in the panel, suggesting that in tax issues there are at least few basis or desire for commitment today.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and those of Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of supporting shocks, when the Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and medical assistance, then followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would the change cause?
The public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partism of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead point, as happened in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of people.
Anyone who thinks he’s losing will probably change course and seek commitment.
However, this can be an optimistic view.
Partitism and polarization are currently greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological hole between Obama and Congress Republicans than was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, both parties activists see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilism shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort from both sides to find points in common on issues that still divide them.
A filtered U.S. document portrays Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The city’s control is in the hands of a “cleptocracy,” and leaves a portion of the bribes and protection money that raises directly to the Kremlin, according to the U.S. Embassy in Russia in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service manage huge chanting systems, which helps explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Each strategy of bureaucracy, which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called “vertical authority,” takes its part as money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on his website Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Mayor of Moscow, and he blamed him for much of corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev released him in October, but there has been little evidence of cleaning since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns an important construction company, have systematically denied the allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several allegations for lies on such allegations.
In September, when in a Russian television channel he asked about a documentary that he suggested was corrupt, he said, "It's madness, a patronage, a fatigue."
According to surveys, the Russians believe overwhelmingly that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard that foreign diplomats are those who do that.
“Moscow’s government’s direct slogans with crime have led some to call it ‘disfunctional’, and to claim that the government works more like a cleptocracy than as a government,” the statement said.
“The criminal elements enjoy a ‘krysha’ (a term of the criminal world and mafia that literally means ‘the roof’ or protection) that passes over the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor’s office, as well as all sectors of Moscow’s government bureaucracy.
“Analysts identify a three-level structure in the criminal world of Moscow.”
"Luzhkov is at the highest."
“The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level.”
“Eventually, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill an empty in some areas, because the city does not provide some services.”
The report states that the SFS collects money from larger companies, and that the police points to small businesses.
One source, the report said, “explained that Moscow’s business owners understand that the best thing is to get the protection of MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.”
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their business closed by one pretext or another.
Medvedev has talked several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports about men taking suitcases, probably filled with cash, within the same Kremlin.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust bureaucrats,” said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem’s expert group in Moscow in a recent interview.
“But he is a part of this bureaucracy.”
“He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia.”
Without politics, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
On a national scale, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption carried out by the Transparency International non-governmental organization, the country was ranked at 154 (the countries are ranked at least at the most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy’s note, which didn’t happen late at the night of Moscow, will certainly cause disgust within the Russian government, and despite Luzhkov may be guilty of Moscow’s weaknesses, it might be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it’s solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents might be lies and reacted furiously by a revelation that claimed that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this is related to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," he said.
“But to be honest to you, we don’t suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it would have been done in such an immoral way.”
Veterans of the Red Jemers forced to face the past
In a weakly illuminated concrete classroom, with stained walls, director of the Anlong Veng Secondary School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Red Jemers Ta Mok.
"Here everyone loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader and was worried about his people,” said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the Meatman" for his brutality during the government of the Red Jemers, the commander remains popular in this remote fortress of the Red Jemers in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemers gave up to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly face people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Red Jemers to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a United Nations and Cambodia joint court issued the first sentence of a former Red Jemer member, sentencing former chief of the well-known Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Anlong Veng Red Jemers, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate to Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Red Jemeres, but they can’t do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
“For them, life under the Red Jemers was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.”
“This is generating divisions within families.”
During the government of the Cambodia Red Jemers, between 1975 and 1979, they were executed or died of hunger, illness or excess work, about 1.7 million people.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government led by Pol Pot, the remains of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodia border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement took over in December 1998.
Like Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and jungles of Western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of fighters from the Red Jemers began to desert towards the government, culminating in Ieng Sary’s resignations in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while waiting for the process.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest fighters of the Red Jemers fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite officials of the Red Jemers retained their local administrative positions in exchange for laying their weapons, the raw soldiers remain poor and non-qualified farmers.
“These people have gained few benefits after the surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
“They have incorporated the utopic agricultural ideology of the regime.”
“They were raised without any concept for doing business.”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Jemers when he was a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before devoting himself to life as poor rice farmer in 1998.
“Life with the Red Jemers was okay,” he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone to eat."
“But now life is difficult because we have to self-please.”
The current Court of the Red Jemers has also caused concerns here.
Earlier next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Red Jemers minister.
The court's mandate is to prosecute the leading leaders and those of greater responsibility for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will pursue cases in addition to those four.
This didn’t serve much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district head in Banteay Meanchey province during the Red Jemers government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told Cambodia’s Documentation Center researchers that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers are thought to have died.
During a recent buzzy afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden pilots on a ground road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemers.
She claimed that if the court called her, she would not be present.
“Cambodia is peaceful and stable,” he said.
"If there are more processing, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who deserted from the Red Jemers in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspicious, although experts and historians question it.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But dealing with the past is just what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
“Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to unite the broken pieces again,” he said.
“It is our obligation to bring together these broken pieces so that we can understand.”
The center produced the first textbook approved by the government on the Red Jemers, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed at Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the high school history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Red Jemers.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know few details about the Red Jemers, despite the bond of the city with the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But her parents reacted with skepticism when she took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court," he said.
“They have suspects because they are not sure about the number of people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are starting to produce an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Red Jemers retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too many bad herbs and covered with discharged plastic bags leads to a black hollow rectangle covered by a oxidized sheet ceiling.
Pol Pot's body was burned here over a lot of tyres after his death in 1998.
31-year-old Nuom Sothea, a cell phone seller on the edge of the road, said he didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many inhabitants of the place go there to pray," he said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot's last rest, where he would leave a handle of mature bananas with the hope of having good luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its reserve of qualified uranium for weapons
In a surprising victory for President Obama’s campaign to protect nuclear material worldwide, the Belarus government announced Wednesday that it will resign from its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement published after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, beyond a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to renounce its highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a point without return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a couple of operations classified with Belarus were carried out over the past two months, to withdraw 84.82 kg of qualified uranium for weapons from a Belarus research facility.
This prepared the ground for the Wednesday agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke since anonymity due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important results of the Nuclear Security Summit of 47 nations chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was apparently a good achievement to ensure the former Soviet republic’s invitation to the next summit in 2012.
“I really felt fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This demonstrates that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Society, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said the agreement is “a very significant and important step” given by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under George W. Bush’s administration.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never renounce its uranium.
"We have preserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically qualified uranium for weapons) and low-enrichment uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
“We use it for research purposes, it’s all.”
Belarus, however, approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in achieving an agreement.
The officials claimed that the first task of withdrawing Belarus uranium in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
The officials said it was loaded on a special train that travelled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and removal.
According to officials, the second operation ended Monday and was made by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million for the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with low-enrichment uranium research facility, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an energy department official who works on the Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and cautiously orchestrated to strengthen trust" that led to the Clinton-signed agreement.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus owned at least 40 kilograms of uranium qualified for weapons, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will attempt to eliminate its reserve by 2012, according to the joint statement.
The relationships between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's harsh repression of human rights.
But the Wednesday statement suggested a potential distension.
"While progress in these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus acknowledged that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central topic for improving bilateral relations, and it is essential for the country's and its citizens' progress."
Spanish government did not repair CIA flights
The Spanish government did not repair CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners directed to Guantanamo for Spanish territory, the U.S. Ambassador in Madrid said on a telegram.
This reflects the documents filtered by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that then vice president of the government, Maria Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked the Spanish executive to be informed to "empower to demonstrate that they were exercising appropriate surveillance of foreign aircraft through Spain."
In June 2006, following a report from the Council of Europe in which he accused complicity in human rights-contrary practices to a dozen countries, including Spain, took place a meeting between former U.S. Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernandez de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Government of Zapatero out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no repairs to intelligence flights across Spanish territory."
"They simply want to be informed" to avoid being "unprepared picking," reports Aguirre on a cable.
The foreign holder Miguel Ángel Moratinos also noted that the Spanish Executive “wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, in the hands of the judges, the government had a limited capacity of influence.”
In January 2007, Attorney Vicente González told the Embassy that he would not attempt to block the judge’s initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
“These reports contain no incriminatory elements or sensitive information,” the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. reflected its concern about the "appealing coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than the disclossed information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly handle the case between governments,” Aguirre lamentates.
In March 2007, at a lunch between U.S. Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he told him that "though the Spanish judges are rabiously jealous of their independence and do what they consider appropriate," he had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid comments from inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower temperature."
The Ambassador also expresses concern about the PP's action in this matter.
"Despite its pro-American general guidance, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize any indication that the Government of Zapatero tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. Government."
The parish confess complained on the network of the "Agobia" to be a mother
The young girl talked about the child when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the network.
With this supername, which he employed from a young age, he communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two natural of Noia, the Korun people from which she originates.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC rebuilds through testimonies from his family.
The 30-year-old Galician began a relationship in 1998 with Iván Tuñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left it, it was soon known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him be DNA tested.
Soon he met another bride.
The elected was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, neighboring municipality.
He lived with him for a long period.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labour market, the boy stayed with her partner, who even came to accompany her a week at Palma.
But because of the content of the communications, it is seen that his romance broke, that they broke.
In March 2008 he is in Menorca, alone, and writes, "Alberto is very rare and mosqued, because I've come to work."
“When I told him it seemed good, but of course, he now realizes what it is to be with the child all day and not having freedom to do what he wants.”
Then talk about a message to the phone you just received: "I want you to go back this month or give me an address to send you to the child."
She complains, "If she doesn't like to leave the child with my mother, I'll pick him up when he comes back," she says.
In May, he speaks of the return to his village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm just going to be until 19, because 20 I have to present a job so I don't miss it."
He says that if everything goes well, he takes his firstborn.
"He will be with whom he should, that is, with me, and I will never think of leaving him again with anyone other than my mother," he said.
In July there is another post.
When he clamps it, the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, is supposed to be killed on the 10th, is dead.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but not on the other."
On the one hand he’s with me and he’s a bit like the place, but on the other hand he’s going to class almost every day.”
He talks about a transfer to Mallorca.

Popular would win 4 seats in Congress and PSC would lose 9
With 28-N results, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in votes and members experienced in recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already seen generally because, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes this training obtains in those elections usually doubles that it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomy, the figure rose to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC achieved 384,091 votes.
By maintaining this trend to the rise, which has been nourished by a PSC vote transfer and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections are held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose nothing less than 9 deputies).
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is essential for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose a member - now he has three - while ICV would stay with a member or win one.
But, to maintain the electoral calendar, the most immediate appointment will take place in May 2011 with municipal elections, where populars can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four province capitals and in its relief to the front of the Barcelona Deputy, one of the administrations that manages the most budget - 661 million euros for 2011 -.
Both nationalists and populars coincide with the possibility that the PSC will lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not obtain a majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Because of the Republican debacle, it would not be disliked if this training loses its representation in the Barcelonese Consistory - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in all four capitals and could be decisive forces in Barcelona, Lerida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to protagonize the return in the capital Tarraconense, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has only been located at 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, Ángel Ros, maintains very good relationships with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, were met on several occasions.
Popular have also grown in other major municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aims to form lists on the maximum number of populations.
Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaida
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian detained by agents of the General Police Information Commissioner in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups of Al-Qaeda, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Earth" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let) the last author of the Bombardiers.
The Ministry of Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the "Kampai operation" the Al-Qaeda counterfeit apparatus has "depleted" at an international level and, therefore, its operational capacity.
The researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were counterfeited and then distributed to groups integrating the criminal Al Qaeda galaxy so that their "fighters" can cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only that the jihadist network had operational in Europe, so that investigations have participated, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that in the EU territory will take place in the next few days similar to that developed last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were detained, in Thailand another with the capture of the Pakistani Sir Kishan and Taj Butlayes.
These were those who led from Bangkok the cell settled in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - stole mostly passports from tourists who meet the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents were to be on behalf of men between the ages of 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
In the media of the investigation it is stressed that at the moment no data has been found to link those arrested in Catalonia with the attack in Bombay, despite the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", had been one of the receiving groups of the stolen passports in Spain and then counterfeited in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before the attack was committed, Catalonia was sent through a transfer agency that was “invested” in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by members of the “command” that ended the life of 106 people.
The police have captured abundant documentation.
PP demands Mas to apply tax concert
PPC leader Alicia Sánchez-Camacho had an opportunity yesterday to personally expose him to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and without mandatory philosophist adventures, as is the economic concert that wants to lead.
The president of the popular Catalans went to the meeting of Artur Mas with the certainty he gained 18 deputies at last Sunday’s elections, more than enough to make them want, as the candidate of CiU needs at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition to abstain in the investment vote.
On a possible agreement with the PP, the future alliances that nationalists want to keep in Congress when general elections are held, depend on, but at the moment, the talks that these days keep More with the rest of political leaders are made in key Catalan.
And as regards the President of the PP, to support an investment "it will have to park all sovereign and independentist speeches", as well as the economic concert - similar to the Basque Country - that the convergent leader intends even to submit a referendum.
Both leaders have in common their bet to decrease the political apparatus of a very inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax of successions and donations.
The details of the negotiation on Mas investment will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition -, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric states that the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
Olot’s center owners don’t rule out that their cellar would kill more than 11 elders
The geriatric officials La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage that has caused the institution to the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while there was employed killed at least eleven elderly who was in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the center, attorney Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to exercise the accusation against the responsible" of the deaths but "the legality and responsibility force us to assume the prosecutional situation of civilian officials."
And it is that in addition to the social disregard that the entity may suffer for not having detected the criminal activities of the cellar in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the victims’ relatives are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and has since been killed.
The judge already pointed out in the car ordering the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - who suspected that in many cases no doctor was personally exploring the deceased but that, taking care of the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was dispatched by phone.
The Caritat, through its director, roughly denied this extreme yesterday and pointed out that “the lack of measures cannot at any time have been the cause of what has happened.”
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “there is not a single indication in the case that there has been an imprudent action by anyone other than the accused itself.”
He already baptized as "Angel of Death" confessed yesterday 11 murders and detailed that the first crime committed it on August 29, 2009 to, a month and a half later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case, it caused death by sticking an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime that committed it by helping a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the center staff have access to drugs.
Insulin clips and sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his effort to relieve the suffering of the internals, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyses that are being done in the laboratory that will have to clarify if Vila did not lie and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or, on the contrary, burned them inside by giving them a league as he already confessed he did with the three women who killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the manifestations of the cellator, not even to the number of confessed murders, who do not disclaim that he is superior, and justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after committing, successfully, eight murders.
That is why they say they are made available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors suddenly reacted yesterday to Trichet’s threat that he warned “markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity.”
Peripheral differences have closed strongly and European bank shares have risen more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the ability of the ECB to be wrong, and the euro has barely revealed, which is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is the property of an illegal market that is recovered, but motivated by closing short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will take to lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and tomorrow will have to withdraw for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank required to complete the ineffective public debt purchase plan and eliminate all extraordinary liquidity measures in terms of time and leaving only unlimited access per week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also expect you to continue with your bonus purchase program and even give you the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they remain obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, let God assist us!
Like in their May meeting they claimed that they had not or had considered the purchase of bonds and the markets collapsed, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, Bazuca announced Monday and Wednesday that he had already bought a lot, causing a new market drop.
Yesterday the letter auction for a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28%, versus 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, rates in Portugal fell 30 basic points throughout the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market feeling after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the figures of the Allied Hole and Bank of Ireland have been published.
The estimated figures are about 1 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potentials and have until February to gain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem with stress tests in July, the figures are assumed within the Help Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and has not yet enough support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to relax the tension facing the upcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December where a political commitment is needed to prove that we are a union and that we all play the same partiture.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the anthem of Beethoven’s joy.
In Spain, the president had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sounds in the ears of investors such as the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchange.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been quick and substantial and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bonus that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will be solved with strong demand and help dissipate doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Help Plan would be self-inmolation.
We would be given a line of liquidity that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in liquidity available than in March, to expensive rates and closes you access to the sine-die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's wife, "besides being it, it seems it."
Anxiety, we can.
Chairman of Eulen will dispute Vega Sicilia's board asked for her children
The temporary does not amain in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will contestate, considering it "full-right novel," the judicial board of El January on 16th, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will attempt to make the majority of them and become with the management bodies of the firm holding Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesus David and Maria Joseph are tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation for control by part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services to the company does not seem willing to give up in its litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
Five of his seven children who were appointed administrators at the shareholders’ assembly of 18 January this year and whose dispute is recorded in the Merchant Register.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the next 16th, summoned by the judge of the Mercantil Number 2 in Madrid, has again opened the box of thunders in the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the call for the board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is qualified by David Álvarez as a “desperate recourse of his five applicants to, through prosecutional arguments, in fraud of law and abuse of law, attempt to validate and heal the radically zero board of January 18,” according to officials.
This argument will be the basis for, once the board has been held, to proceed with its contesting by considering it to be "full-right nucleus".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already attempted unsuccessfully that the magistrate would convene a board in June.
In El Enebro, heritage society and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven sons of David Álvarez control 100% of capital.
The founder of the service group, however, claims the usufruct over 51% of capital, according to family protocols.
This matter is the substantial issue that the judge should decide once the view on the demand for contesting is celebrated, for which there is no date yet.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon by Siemens
A software designs real-time car improvements.
Since Red Bull crashed into the Formula 1 world in 2004, his story in this select speed universe has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into consideration the options of a new arrival squad and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final straight of the championship, all bet for Fernando Alonso’s Ferrari triumph.
Without deserving the ability as a pilot of the finally champion, German Sebastian Vettel, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the “secret weapon” that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German launched on the market in 2007 for purposes far away from high car competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to design assembly chains from manufacturing factories worldwide, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, simulate the product or process faithfully before building it really, avoiding failures and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s photo cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and take effect "in a few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements that are detected during races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the squad in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in vehicles during each season.
At the Red Bull team today works 180 young high-quality professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of changes to the bolides.
Siemens’ manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull’s bolides except the engine, which is Renault’s entire responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can be brought from the simulator’s virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this folly of technological improvement is the $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as much in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has assembled the high-tech factory to design and produce its bolides in a town about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings in which visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered “high secret”.
The template for this task amounts to 580 people, including their two pilots, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull’s Formula 1 hero, without a doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy beverages has put to the service of its participation in the circuits, other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and their notoriety are hidden.
Factory technology chief Steve Nevey said five years ago it could be claimed that R&D advances in truck cars contributed 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have varied and technology amounts to 85% of success, while drivers contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettel or Webbers will never be replaced by computer because they are “unpredictable gladiator.”
HP will install its own 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened yesterday in Barcelona his first exclusive shop in collaboration are his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the 20 store network between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will support this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Vice President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, posed as an example the remodeled store located in the Great Via de Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has collaborated for 30 years.
The U.S. group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy including the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third one.
Herrero did not want to unveil the following possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP Personal Systems also assured that the philosophy to install stores will always be the same, supporting a local dealer with expertise and industry knowledge.
The American group advises and takes care of the exclusive furniture design of shops (with products that can be interactively touched), which will have an identical image in Europe.
In addition, HP covers the training of establishment staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in purchasing, care, after-sales and even packaging."
The Barcelona store includes a space with a worldwide pioneering pilot program that is responsible for solving the potential problems of HP’s guarantee computer equipment.
An online service connects to a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
“So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days.”
“This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, since large companies already have hired technical assistance services,” said Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bet 'stoling' a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other managers, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for the banking, but initially discardes a new liquidity crisis and vaccines the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it provides for a decline in interest margins, which will be attempted to compensate in part with increases in commissions and the credit price.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years, their pending subject.
Sabadell has found a way to explode for the next three years and be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new director plan that will have a three-year validity in 2011.
The goal, in addition to surviving without having to resort to FROB’s public aid, is to gain market share with the capture of a million new private customers – 700,000 if those who can leave the bank – their big pending subject, as it had so far more mistaken SMEs and companies than the retail customer.
This year it has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Their market share in particular is 3.5%, while in companies exceeds 10%.
Another of the basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the betting on productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with reduction in costs as a target, and whose challenges the bank will expose them when presenting the results of the year.
Few banks dare to set goals and make them public as the financial crisis has displaced all the global banking plans.
Sabadell, in fact, will close up this year’s managing plan Optima, set four years ago, although initially for three, but the situation in the markets caused it to expand another exercise.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their primary goal.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "tough and transcendental" year.
In fact, the executive believes that the outbreak of the crisis in Spain will "be slow."
In addition, in two or three years, it will be “very difficult to create jobs,” something essential for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And although it believes that the liability war - which penalizes the margins - is being reduced, the price of the risk premiums that are paying banks and cash for their emissions to obtain liquidity are already moving to the price of the credit to compensate for the fall of the margins.
"The theme of liquidity and funding is structural, and it will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the clip, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola said.
Banesto already gave orders to his network on Thursday to limit the long-term credit and increase the price of the differentials – see FiveDays of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the banking trend is now "to raise commissions", but "there is a competitive framework."
Sabadell’s director plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he assures that in Spain "it will be required larger sizes."
“The next year everything is going to move,” he said.
He claims that capital needs are "increasing much" and does not rule out that any Spanish financial entity enters in red numbers.
And it points out that the FROB can supplement the market in collecting funds from new recapitalizations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it remained important to what some bankers already vatican as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but unlike what happened in June, it can be obtained short-term funding through rest, which bursts the crisis.
ECSC dismiss a second wave of fusions in the boxes
ECSC Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta dismissed yesterday that a wave of savings box fusions will be produced and again insisted on the speed with which the sector’s restructuring is being executed.
When he started the concentration process of Spanish savings boxes, several entities ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Boxes (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, dismissed yesterday that this new wave of operations will take place.
“I think the biggest part of the mergers has been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Banking group cannot be said it’s a second round, which are adjustments.”
“The majority is completely made; maybe instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all major processes have already been done and guarded by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated greatly in that too,” the director said.
In statements during a breakfast of the Aragón Association of Directors and Executives (ADEA), Olavarrieta has exposed that the concentration process is being "accomplished as fast as possible, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is going to happen in the times that on their day, not now, were marked in business plans with the Bank of Spain."
"Passing from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion asset volume to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that has no stopover in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so they are much larger to meet Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of quite unfortunate opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year."
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and “probably” in the world, and attributed to those who put it in fabric a “lack of knowledge”.
The manager pointed out that, within the current economic conjuncture, “we can be very calm” with the situation of financial institutions and savings boxes, a system that has undertaken a “important” concentration process and “goes at as fast as possible.”
He also recalled that the Spanish bank went very well from the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July.
Shopatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has established the conditions for the entire Union.
Tensions in the markets have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced further adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulations of private placement agencies or deletion of 426 euros of aid to non-profit stops, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of State Lottery.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to unleash the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
Go ahead that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in his communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another turn of nut in the difficult redefinition process of the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new view of what its future should be, which strikes with that of maintaining the old traditions of much of its partners.
In front of European resistances, in Germany, it begins to speculate about the three possible outflows to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, comprised of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although it now seems to be science fiction, with a very favorable stream of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with German proposals of higher macroeconomic control, budget rigor, fines to transgressor countries, possible suspension of payments from one of them and extension of the costs of potential adjustments to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defining for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated the deficits, the German government removed a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed to be done (tax rigor and stability plans in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the front gave it the Central European country when Merkel severely expanded Greece’s rescue decision.
Already then it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public and published opinion were very against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel once again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union treaties, to make it possible to rescue a country and at the same time force private lenders to run with some of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as an anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweet, has been approved and in the coming months we should assist in the reform process of the Union that allows those measures to be made since 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not plan to cross.
And he is telling us all that, although now it is necessary to take steps with which he may not agree very much, from that date the old functioning of the euro has been over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which infringing countries will be severely sanctioned, may be obliged to declare themselves in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also run with some of the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive outside balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that has led Spanish growth in the years of boom, they simply won’t tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we would do badly not understand it.
It is not just about reducing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they demand is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is deceiving ourselves.
I hope the current turbulence will leave a step towards greater tranquility.
And let’s take advantage of the window of opportunity that has been given to us, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with big companies and the announcement of yesterday’s new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel, the thesis has been opened to order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn’t seem to be moving it.
And, among the possibilities that are contemplated, that of leaving a monetary zone that is too tired of unserious countries, cannot be excluded.
Then Germany can always tell us that it had already warned us.
Sport and law fraud
Treats like Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not willing to escape a penalty.
The allegedly urged expulsion by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match against Ajax in the Champions League on November 23 has caused ink rivers to be written about whether such behavior is either anti-sport or not and if, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As it is well known, lacking a few minutes to finish the match (which their team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately wasted time when taking off paths to cause the arbitrator to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid is already going to end as the leader of its group, both players will comply with the regulatory penalty for the next match, against the Auxerre, and will be able to pass clean of cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA discipline committee has sanctioned with two matches the team coach, José Mourinho, and with different economic amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the rules not written but followed by this sport.
Part of the debate arising in the reported case is because it has been starred by a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem presume of nobility and honor, and that has sometimes fined its players for similar acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, apparently by Mourinho, who adds a more episode to his dilated History.
In any case, the debate turns around whether such behavior not expressly prohibited by the rules of procedure contradicts the principles of sport, i.e., if these actions committe fraud of law; therefore, they are in fact actions respecting the rules of discipline, but they seem to prevent their meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage that causes the sports spirit.
One of the goods that the sports spirit comprises is the physical integrity of the opposite players, aspect that with these actions was not put into danger, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these goods related to the clean game is to prevent the player’s team from taking advantage of the opposite team in an unfair manner, which has not happened either.
Now, the paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it did not accommodate what we usually characterize as a trap or law fraud, because its violation of the rules was not hiddenly done to try to avoid the penalty, but precisely its action tried to be the most evident thing to receive the penalty of the arbiter.
They hoped and tastefully accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage the infringers obtain in the intended misconduct examined.
Here it seems necessary to find that the rival is not in disadvantage or profit from the same game, as obviously the result of the action means leaving the team itself with fewer players.
And it’s not a useful strategy for the next match either, because the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that players will start the next stage of the League of Champions without cards that may threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, as the team can be removed at the first exchange, and in addition with this performance players perform a sanction match and pass to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, by going through rounds, it’s not so clear that it’s an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the sports spirit, of which it is party to make strategic decisions to make the most of what the rules allow.
In the event that we are involved, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (that would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit it.
They made a strategic decision without drawing the punishment or fleeing it.
Although the border between ingenuity and law fraud is diffuse, this time I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, I think, arises from two factors: because it was about two self-expulsions and the way the transmission of the guideline to provoke them was carried out.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not both ethical and aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to capture group Christmas dinners in NCBs
The calendar dictatorship focuses this year on a balance of reserves for 16 and 17.
They promote self-supported celebrations by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As the tournament and lottery, with the arrival of December, group dinners pre-Christmas also return, which continue to exercise oxygen ball for restoration and leisure in Barcelona, but that due to the crisis have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority customers: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or business meals.
To end up complicating accounting, this year’s calendar (at the fall of the New Year on Friday) has focused requests on the week of December 13, with the result until the date of a avalanche of dinner reserves for tip days (16 and 17) and just movement for the previous week.
As has already happened since 2008, when the stage of weak cows began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners on budgetary matter.
In order to avoid tradition, many workers keep it paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the conjuncture, one and the other require battle prices, confirms the president of the Barcelona Restauration Board, Gaietà Farràs.
The employer’s representative, today, is not daring to vatican how this month’s celebrations will be.
“People think of it long before booking.”
"It wants to go out but it has the alerts on the price issue," he said.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at good price and with good service," he adds, and remembers that customers tend to drop a stage with the crisis, so the strip around 25 euros has become a majority in demand.
In a survey in several central establishments, the collapse of requests for the night of 17 is observed.
In the Soteras group, there is an authentic boom of applications for Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the conjuncture, with full formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 properties in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the calendar’s peculiarity has led to more early reservation, even since early November.
"We have done the impossible thing to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," he said.
At AN Group, who bandits El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 locals, they remain optimistic after detecting an increase in billing since the second half and a good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group highlight that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends precelebrating the parties.
To his six group menus they have added one Christmas, with the 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green outbreaks in some companies that reinvite their employees and feel that the volume of the groups is somewhat greater.
On the part of the employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure), his vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts to begin seeing the end of the tunnel and argues that reservations are "animated" together, though customers "negotiate at the maximum".
Yes, the illusion for the celebrations has not fallen down, pay whoever pays, indicates.
Pakistan’s nuclear program generates great concern in the U.S.
Islamabad produces “atomic weapons at a faster pace than any other country.”
Wikileaks’ leaks confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the huge concerns caused by the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
Besides the clarifying and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and thoughts of American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between both countries in atomic security, rather than growing, “decreases,” and that the unstabil Asian country produces nuclear weapons “at a faster pace than any other country.”
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to hinder their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for revealing in Washington.
Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, listed this in a report prior to the visit of the National Security Councillor James Jones: “The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersion of nuclear materials, and the vulnerability of transportation of atomic materials.”
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is considered, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a proliferating and motive to maintain the guard.
“Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programs,” Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said at a meeting with its American counterparts.
The most novel documentation led by Julian Assange’s portal is the increasingly lower cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high Pakistani pace of nuclear weapons production.
A office of the embassy in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrant", argues: "Transparency is often inexistent; aid offers are unanswered or dismissed."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to leave the official “very clear” that “the Pakistani Army must end tacit support to the terrorist groups.”
The Hunt of the Wikileaks Boss
Obama appoints a senior responsible for the anti-terrorism struggle to avoid new leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to follow the movements and locate Assange wherever it is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and his founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is hard to be sure about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrest order.
It is not new, but dates from November 20.
And it doesn’t have to do with the last leak of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks’ creator’s lawyer Mark Stephens says that “the police know where and how to get in touch with Mr. Assange.”
It was on the 20th day when the international police body based in Lyon (France) issued the order on the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of the country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have indications to identify or locate Assange "in order to his provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, the organization has explained, do consider the so-called network notice for free way to proceed to an arrest -- which must agree to the national police body -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as Sweden and England, where it is believed to be Assange.
The movement has indignated Assange’s lawyers, who published a letter yesterday denounced that the founder of Wikileaks, 39, has been ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by videoconference.
They also remember that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, comparing to the mythical Lavrenty Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s chief of security.
“This seems like a hunting, not a legal persecution,” the messenger denounced.
While the world seeks him - and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son - Assange remains unknown, but not silent.
On Monday he granted from an undetermined place an interview with Time magazine director through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spie in the UN violating international treaties that the United States has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was denoted yesterday by the White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation "ridiculous and absurd."
“I’m not totally sure why we should care about a guy’s opinion with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior responsible for the anti-terrorist fight, Rusell Travers, to prevent new leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to remain important to Assange contrasts with opinions that these days proclaim conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber from January, has asked the State Department to study the possibility to include Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and pursue anyone who has any contribution or aid to them."
Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, has still gone farther after saying Assange should "be killed."
“Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned aircraft or something.”
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, the Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
“Whoever in the government filtered the information is guilty of betrayal and anything other than execution would be too kind punishment,” he said.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with guineas to Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote secretly on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to draw the one-to-one internal revolt in the ERC rows, without the north due to the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his resignation amage is insufficient for the related to former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that he can at all cause the head breaks he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra will attempt to win the new critics with cranks that allow him to armour until the municipal elections.
Puigcercos announced yesterday that more than 200 ERC national counselors will be able to pronounce on their continuity in secret.
By paperboards, not by hand lifted.
If carodists want to vehicle a certain vote of punishment to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of rows wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he claimed that it would not be considered ratified with half another one of the votes, but added, without specific percentages, that either would be good to "Bulgaria".
The next to Carod demands the president something more than putting his office at the disposal of the military, a gesture that is not worthwhile when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But having no sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap from here to May.
To do so, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to vote by the national council on 18th.
His intention is to swallow Puigcercos in exchange that he promises to advance the congress in autumn 2011, something that the summit already gives.
The ERC leader acknowledged that "polyphony" harms stability and that its goal is to make the organization, once and for all, able to wash the dirty door slots inward.
In this line, the article that conseller Josep Huguet signed on his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercos, the holder of Innovation said the leader will be repressed "in exchange for various goals".
Five of them, of which are two.
The first, "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, i.e., include new faces that come from the affinity sector to Carod.
The second can be the great newness.
Huguet proposes that ERC fluid once assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it proposes a reform of the statutes to enable congresses to be held through delegates elected by vote.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercos team, which has already battled in this regard at the last two congresses.
In fact, the conclave convulsion of 2008 left the responsibility of the leadership to review assembly at a specific congress of statutes reform.
This appointment remains pending, as the internal tide of the last few years disagreed to address the matter.
Now, without critical sectors, it can be a good time to take it back and try to close it forever.

China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The country’s representative at the COP16 has made huge efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it’s offering to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offering to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at the COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that its country has made huge efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to convert its industry.
In fact, he explained, over the past four years, his country has invested $245 million in efforts to decrease greenhouse gas emissions.
However, it made clear that China will not modify its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in that matter.
He said that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four categories: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and pilot program support.
In all these categories, including last year’s approval of a new Energy Act, which sets up the objectives set for reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with state and locals to achieve energy savings, energy efficient use and emission reduction goals.
Furthermore, it was abundant, they are in progress or have already concluded several multi-annual plans, both funded by the Chinese government and governments of other countries.
For example, he referred to the Efficiency of Energy Use Programme, which was implemented over the past five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also launched, another for the shift of incandescent focus by savings, and one more mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientist adviser to the government of that country on climate change, assured that China’s efforts have been greater than it is generally thought.
For example, he explained, per capita emission of greenhouse gas in China is six tonnes per person, while in the United States is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use, as increased energy efficiency by 20 percent over the past five years and plans to do more by 2020.
Attached to the legality expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national PAN leader detailed that the former panic leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is agreed upon his right.
PAN national leader César Nava Vázquez said that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to legality and that the former panic leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is agreed on his right.
In a previous interview with Gabino Cue Monteagudo’s protest as governor of the state, he said that the expulsion of Espino is in any case a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has his right, if appropriate, to appeal to the National Council Order Commission, in such a way that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body," he said.
On the other hand, he stated that it’s not time to think in 2012 and that an alliance for presidential candidate was never at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said it was convinced that National Action will be strengthened by the internal election of 4 and 5 December, in which it will have to choose its successor.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that never was at the negotiating table, at least not for now, was a approach to the local election that was successful and fulfilled the goal," he said.
The panic leader stated that the PAN supports 71 years of dialogue, so "we don't frighten internal competition; the container "we enjoy it and strengthen it," he said.
He said that the council will certainly be able to choose the best or best leader who requires National Action for the next three years, hence he will deliver the scam "to whom the council determines."
“I have that absolute tranquility and openness, to any of the five would be proud to give him the office of the president of the party.”
He forecast that the repeat that registered the party in the last July 4 elections will be reflected in the upcoming contests, though "it's not time to think yet in 2012."
"For now it's about accompany Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this framework, he stressed that the three alliance-emanated governments in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, therefore "lots of hopes, anxies are placed on them, and I am sure Gabino will meet expectations."
In being questioned about the criticism of the PRI to President Felipe Calderón for his speech in the four years of his government, César Nava called on the priests to reflect on the sexenies of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderon; let them start defending them; let them come out of the closet," he said.
He believed that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because there is no bite or much less censorship in the country.
Promotes Obama on Twitter Law in favour of unpacked students
“If you agree that the Dream Act is the appropriate thing, call your senators and installs to pass it is legislation,” the U.S. president tweeted.
President Barack Obama joined national mobilization today in support of Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter social account.
“If you agree that the Dream Act is the appropriate thing, call your senators and installs to pass it is legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His brief message maintains an open cyberlink to a broader document that calls upon the public to immediately communicate with senators, since the vote of legislation is imminent.
“With a vote that is expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice hear,” he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation unless the extension of the Bush era’s tax cuts and government funding are approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked by the Republican blockade of Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs trusted that once the tax issue has been resolved, a schedule can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax matter before the end of the year..."
"I think we can achieve an agreement at some point at that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic majority leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would ask for a "debate closing vote" for Dream Act law, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted from next Thursday in the Senate, although more likely next week.
The senatorial version of the Dream Act or American Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country over the past five years and entered a higher education institution or the army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, so they require the contest of a handful of Republicans, at times that supporting organizations of the project are protagonizing an intense camouflage to guarantee the approval of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom supports the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act require adding several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn back to the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans are Maine senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Florida's outgoing senator George Lemieux, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, from Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, from Texas, but have stated they will not support it once again.
Another Republican who supported John McCain has not defined his position right now.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature, put your finger in the sore
The second round of Language Pleasures was a walk where participants gave the narrative
"That of Sex in the Language I understand it, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected from me?", invited writer Luisa Valenzuela to open the second round of The Pleasures of the Language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of her question (on another fair, the round table was dedicated to sex).
The finger in the injury... "shocked us," Argentine writer sweetly speaked to the public, mostly young people, which was cited at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderate by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Monte participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist in search of knowing what the "call" is, goes from physician to physician, from whom he doesn't get any answers although he doesn't get any tracks on the same narrative.
The infectologist is convinced: "Patience is not my strong, perhaps my injury."
Ultimately, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who stole his breath in the middle of the hall, but who explains that the wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "The wound is the real open thing, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist suspired relieved and concluded "from the wound I only managed to know that it's the real thing open and that it doesn't exist," but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue should go very entertained.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a delightful narrative entitled Elogio of the invention, where the finger in the wound is not named but at a time it is discovered.
With brushes of magical realism, counting a famous witchman, who touched the same clouds, brought back men who had gone away or repaired the virtues that a girl had lost, a narrative that turned to speak then America, the great novel to which his own cronists from the beginning counted and quoted Bernal Diaz del Castillo by the critics.
Cervantes that invented us all (the writers) made mock of the pretty witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told with imagination to which it was missing until pudding.
However, he highlighted “the crazy and the liars are the ones that best imagine” and it is where it converges reality and lie, where it is no longer known that what is narrated belongs to one side or another, where the fiction literature reaches its peak.
It actually calls it the "Cervantine Tradition".
"For his inheritance, we are what is counted."
In her turn, writer Mayra Montero shot and applauded the variety of interpretations to which the FIL’s invitation took place with her round table El Finger in the wound.
The Cuban-Puertorriquean pointed its own towards the great wound of social violence that crosses its country - and shares Latin America - the product of the disputes of drug trafficking and sales.
“I believe good literature, good poetry, good songs enclose a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated,” he said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment established between author and readers, and that in a “chemical reaction” of the latter.
The night the Spanish poet Luis García Montero closed her, whose intervention also emphasized "of that finger on the blade of the writer committed to the writer."
He considered that in a hurry-living world, also in the intellectual customs and control of the consciousness that leads to dogmatism, forgetting that behind each affirmation there is a small no and behind each denial there is a small yes.
“To be owner of our thinking and owner of reality we have to match: and matching means often putting your finger in the wound and bother those people who are much more comfortable thinking of caricature, black and white, established and unmatching ideas and bother also the powers that prefer a black and white world,” he said, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had high down in his career, but has already been able to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, has had higher in his career, but has already been able to reach the decisive series three times, although he has so far gone blank and that’s why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentinian has finished comforting with the sub-champ medal, a step behind the winners has left and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The santist strategy reached his first final as coach at the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he was holding the Morelia rides with which he fell for global 4-2 before Toluca; later, in Closure 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with global 3-1 and was precisely before Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentenary Tournament, again before the Devils, Rubén suffered a reversal again, as his team ended up 2-2 in front of the cherrys after 210 minutes of game, but in the penalty tanda he was advantageous for 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for three of his players finally failed since the 11th-3 steps.
Ruben already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore he does not want to race the same luck, seeks to get rid of the evil and be able to celebrate a title for the first occasion, although he claims that the most important thing for him is the institution.
“I want to leave champion, I don’t want to break any statistics, that’s for a club, for a fan to which I owe and consequently the title will come for me, but the above is the most important thing,” he said when he asked about the numbers he has against playing finals.
“The only teaching we can have is that until the silver arbiter’s end we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the strip, the players as well, because the previous time, with two penalties for thrown we were already prepared to run out and I think that’s a teaching, until the match is finished we can celebrate.”
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal shootings, something that doesn’t worry about him, because he relys on his players: “One never seeks to reach the penalty, one seeks to end in regular time, but sometimes there is no other one and we have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were ready, unfortunately made us a bad destin, some time for the nerves or the title.
Romano has in his hands stop being a sub champion technician and test for the first time the glory that the titles give.
EU changes rules to get visa
People must go to Visa Applicants Service Centers prior to their interview at the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and the waiting time.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing a visa will be changed at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates.
With the new procedure, most applicants must visit Visa Applicants Service Centers (ASC) prior to their interview at the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will take the biometric information of the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for the applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer need to make a payment to conclude the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another for the messaging service delivered the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: equivalent to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for requested visa cases (including temporary workers visas) and $390 for merchants and investors visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will submit their documents and take their footprints.
Because the biometric information will be taken in the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in this less time than in the past.
Also, those applying for visa at the Consulates in Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the $26 extra service fee.

NASA announces the find of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency quoted the press to present a finding tomorrow that will cause an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could prove the theory that there is alien life.
The finding will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 13:00 p.m. at NASA’s headquarters in Washington by astrobiology experts, a science described as the responsible for studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
In citing the press, NASA said it will present “a find that will cause an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life,” which raised speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures together with ourselves and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility that they become intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and from this capacity increases the possibility that similar life might exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be demonstrated that “there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from what we know.”
The space agency will reveal the real scope of the findings at the Thursday press conference.
The conference will participate geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who study the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the largest moon of Saturn), under the perspective that his chemistry is similar to Earth’s.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern 'block' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of ‘bipartism’, they denounce.
The 60 Legislature was not installed when an opposition block emerged in Congress, headed by PRD members, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patron Montalvo, who declared independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of “bipartitism” to the House.
Before entering the installation session of the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'trained' against the reform of the Organic Law, as it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it begins the 'bipartidism', because now they will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, led by panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his character as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo, detailed that with these reforms institutionally constitutes the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He detailed that in the next few days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be overthrown again by both parties and thereby the opposite coalition ended.
“Until here it came (the opposition coalition), it’s what I look at, because we are excluded from any decision, they don’t even have the political difference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patron, there are coincidences and therefore they are formed a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress after being monopolic, now be “duopolic.”
“It is not the spirit to reform the law that there is an eternal bipatism in Congress.”
First, this group is starting with five lawmakers, and they’re talking to other fellows to make them more, the convergent increased.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from the PT, explained that Congress has currently become a 'bottin' between two, in a reference to the PAN and PRI.
“Before it was just a match, now they’re sharing it between two.”
Patron Montalvo, asked to be respected the personality of the deputy, he is given his place at the negotiating tables.
“Not because of coupular agreements, leave outside five that we probably will make nine deputies, expend the five who see us, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unite to seek a place at the negotiation table, that’s the issue that in the reform they made them agree, we’re outside and we’re not agreeing with that reform.”
$200 thousand more for "the supplier"
Mazatlan City Hall pays another check to the questioned electrical equipment company owner.
A check for a little more than 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount paid in this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200,000 pesos.
According to the municipality's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, with the amount of 200,000 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts to be paid".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had advanced that it would lend more money from the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Audit for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still debted to you and, therefore, how many more checks are missing to issue in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing has been bought, you’re simply paying what you owe, like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks “reappeared” in the last quarter of the year: September 24, October 15, October 19, October 29, November 16, and November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as the Law marks it when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using their services, the Treasurer assured that they have not re-used their services.
The above, after on July 25, Northwest published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, revealing that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, to Camacho Palazuelos paid the municipality more than 10 million cheques through 42 pesos.
He also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where he bought checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgent to serve tourist sites
Tourist entrepreneurs are lamenting foreign tourist accident for poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After a foreign tourist fell in a drop in the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector in Mazatlan asked authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor state and project a poor port image.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Golden Zone Traders Association, recalled that at different times they have denounced to take care of the image of the fate and reverse how bad tourists encounter with new activities or routes.
He said the bad state of the streets and banquets has affected because tourists come to walk and see the disorder and get it back to nearby businesses.
Politicians do not know what it is to close a company one day and have no idea of the money that is lost, or otherwise they would not do the works in this way in so long and without the proper planning.
Hotellor José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist’s fall exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Hall.
“The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it because it will give preventive maintenance and not only fall into the corrective,” he said.
"We are looking forward to enjoying a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants that we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that also look neglected and incomplete, he said, such as the Shield and the Venadito of Mazatlan.
“Today, for the tourist to come doesn’t depend solely on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleaning on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions,” he said.
“No due attention has been given, and this type of facts points out something that is notorious for everyone, maintenance is needed.”
Raúl Llera Martínez, deputy secretary for Tourism Promotion, said it is urgent to rescue tourist sites in Mazatlan, as they are not correctly taken advantage of and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be put in line with the municipality and be priority to have the city daily, clean, ordered and attractive because it is of tourism vocation.
“Fortunately, Mazatlan offers many historic and cultural sites and places that will have to order first, clean and put us online to make them attractive to be able to add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination.”
Ask for IP results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members take the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges he faces.
A decent and free labour legislature of agreements between parties and the State Executive claims the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60 legislature, comprised of seven political forces, 19 PRI members, 13 PAN members, three New Alliance Party, two PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one of the PVEM, which sums a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to conduct a clean and commitment to society and the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partism or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, President of the Business Coordinator Council, proposed that the newly released 40 State Congress members take the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges he faces.
“We hope that Members actually exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is a custom that make arrangements to secure their own interests and become comparable carnivals of the rulers and leaders of parliamentary fractions.”
He therefore spoke that they will ensure the commitment to establishing the necessary bridges to take the Governor forward in turn.
“We carry out that they come to do a worthy job, especially committed to society and the sectors because they were the Signoensians who gave them the vote of trust in the past elections.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Three Isles Hotels Association, considered one of the major challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in search of the state’s economic growth, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that somehow will encourage the generation of jobs.”
As for the tourism activity, he called for new legislators to give him the weight within the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretary.
“I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lower budget and is incompatible as important economic activity and foreign exchange and investment generator and that directly competes with the agricultural industry.”
In addition to the requirement of labelling resources for detonational tourism projects that co-help to ensure the state and update the Alcohol Act that has not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
Looking for a magician king
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next Kings Day will be difficult to please their illusions, as their home is formed by nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they want so much.
The family lives in a humble house of Salvador Allende Cologne and live on the day because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Sometimes we see her hard because my husband has no chamba, but we sell Mandarin and Papa... already in the afternoon I'm going out with the 'plebes' to sell to the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, four-year-old, wants a doll or a bike, while her sister Isabel, three-year-old, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a 'monster' car and for his eight-month-year-old brother Jesus, Cayetana suggests size clothes for a year.
"I told me (José Alfredo), 'I wish this monster', but I told him, 'Let's see the son' because he was very expensive.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and footwear would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11, is size 12; Isaiah, 10, is size 10, while Michael, 8, wears size eight.
José Juan, 14, lacked tennis, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be of great help.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family reality you can participate in the Seek a Magical King campaign, donating a toy or cash at the Northwest reception.
Fourteen alleged drug traffickers are arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions have been held in the framework of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen people have been detained who will face various accusations.
Persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
“Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for production have been captured,” said Quebec Security spokesman Louis-Philippe Ruel.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged network leaders, two Sherbrooke men.
The detainees had to attend the Sherbrooke Justice Palace in the hours following their detention.
They could face the allegations of cannabis production, possession with the aim of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have occurred after a long investigation that has lasted nearly a year.
"It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to make the arrests," Mr. Ruel said.
About seventy police officers participated in the Quebec Security Estrie Investigation Module, Sherbrooke Police Service and Memphrémagog Police Department.
Fighting clandestine migration can be struggled without trouble
The bill of the Conservatives, which, according to the Government, should solve the problem of the patterns loaded with clandestine migrants, will surely face a great opposition, since the three opposition parties announced Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I'm primarily based on the Charter."
“I meet here with a party that has created the granite that pisais,” said liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by the members after the weekly meeting of the Caucus.
Liberals defend that the bill in its current form, which would allow to stop up to one year anyone from a vessel identified as the transport of clandestine immigrants, infringes the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Quebec Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe also said he could not support the bill because he points to wrong white.
"We are against and, as it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will already see what the government does," Duceppe said.
The criticism of the NPD in the field of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticism that the NPD party is not firm enough with illegal immigrants.
"Neo-Democrats agree that measures will be taken against those in charge of clandestine paterns and that is what we intend with another bill, the C-35," Mrs. Chow said.
“We don’t support the bill of the Conservatives because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year,” Mrs. Chow explains.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused parties of the position of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tells members that they do not tolerate this type of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as if it were a felpud."
“They hope Canada will take firm action,” said Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a trust vote on its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
Nevertheless, a conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the Government was going to request a vote for each member to oppose to be explained to its voters.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Although Jean Charest had announced the possible establishment of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion, numerous observers continue to call for a public consultation committee on the matter.
Public Security Minister Robert Dutil supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Investigation since January last year.
The metropolis has a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
Therefore, the Tuesday announcement caught more than one by surprise.
It should be said that, during a Standing Council meeting on Quebec's police services on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the critic of the party that deals with the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this announcement as "a rabbit taken out of the scratch" and "a last-minute haunting solution."
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power would have too much influence on the possible future unity.
“You will see the results when we announce it,” he simply says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the CSQ president, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"The more Mr. Charest is obstinated to avoid the creation of this investigation committee, the more people share our opinion, that is, he has something to hide," he explains.
“The only way to have an investigation committee is with Jean Charest’s resignation,” explains Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this dead point, he suggests Quebec to grant a special mandate to the general interventor to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the general interventor," he concludes.
It also believes that Quebec could grant the interventor the same competences as a Commissioner, thus enabling him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent square is not the only project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to better adapt to this type of crime.
This application seems to proceed from the Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, which has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Public Security Minister Vic Toews has confirmed by his part that his counterpart of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments in relation to this matter.
During the 2001 Spring Operation related to motorist groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Later, Ottawa pushed the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several water courses are being closely monitored due to the heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a land rise in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
At night, there was another land running in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road went down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded strong rainfall, between 40 and 70 mm of rainfall.
Additional 20 to 40 millimeters are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors located north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations are added to the snow ice that had already accumulated in certain sectors, several rivers are feared to overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security Unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The northern rivers, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and the Oak, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the region of Lanaudière, severe precipitation has caused some lakes to be overflowed in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the heavy rains have dragged a provisional bridge.
As a prevention measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflowing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several pathways, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The civil security unit remains alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, security counselor.
The Quebec Grown Forecast Center on Wednesday announced the strong growth of several rivers, in particular the Maskinonge, the Assumption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Wolf.
Partially blame Dupont
Quebec's radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain repeat to the Canadian Council of Radio Television Rules (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians, as well as for his rude language on radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained “inaccurate information on social assistance, an inadvertently negative representation of Haitians, and rude language that should not be used in emissions spread over the day.”
The Council has also indicated that debates on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two persons who had suicided, do not violate broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments on emissions issued between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint from the Common Front of People receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were incorrect.
Presenters must communicate reliable data and not that leads to deception.
Regarding suicide, the introduced Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardion.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message transmitted was that suicide should not be considered a solution to life problems.
"Most of the Committee believes that the episodes disputed by "Dupont le midi" have dealt with a delicate topic in a fair and proper manner."
Therefore, any guilt has been rejected in this regard.
The last litigation referred to the statements made after the Haiti earthquake.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had played a media confrontation that had raised numerous reactions.
The CHOI host said he had made no donations to help Haitians because he couldn’t know safely whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect is an unfairly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already completed my three-day suspension there above."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issue of unfair language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio channel has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the station, which must, among other things, announce decisions once in the hours of greater hearing within three days.
A King of kung-fu in Montreal
The Algerian Montreal Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar tour.
The athlete, who stands out in "sand" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai box, goes up to the world's tatami and rings in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” explained Zemmal, who lives in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
“In my case, I seek fights everywhere because for those who don’t enjoy the game on the ground that involves mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America.”
The athlete, who works as a security agent and employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to its rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association’s Amateur Championship (WKA), held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I’ve won in the full contact kickboxing categories and the Thai box,” he explained.
“I’m currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China.”
“They will invite athletes who have finished among the top four ranks in the world’s last championship in each category.”
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place."
"In 2007, I finished the fifth-range tournament in China, but reached the third-range in Toronto in 2009," he added.
“The interesting thing is that I have progressed in every competition.”
"At this step, I'll be the first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where it is allowed to hit with the handles and feet, as well as throw opponents to the ground.
Confrontations are originally held on a platform and, less often, on a ring.
The most famous pugilist in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Born Zemmal only needs to maintain a competition in his career, he will certainly attend the great "King of Sanda" tournament, the kung-fu Super Bowl.
“This competition is China’s most notorious and prestigious,” the friendly boy explains.
“It’s like the equivalent to the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).
“It’s been an amazing experience.”
Zemmal won his first fight, in his category semi-finals (80 kg), but lost in the final.
“Whoever won me is a true professional,” he said.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals are facing in the final of their category."
"Then the champions of each category face to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
At the center of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium formed by companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior tender the most important contract, the project management contract, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Energie Management, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec’s decision to entrust the private sector to its responsibility to manage this major hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energie management consortium obtained the lucrative contract without previously tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of business consortiums poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and lead to a price rise.
“This is a new method of collusion and eliminating competition.”
"I mean, people, instead of doing it secretly, now openly," Party member Sylvain Simard said at a press conference.
Earlier, in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue at the National Assembly because, as he says, he does not understand how it can benefit the public interest in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, firmly deniing that a collusion has occurred with this contract.
"I start to get tired," he protested, defending that the PQ had acted "dishonestly" and "in the absence of rigor."
He pointed out that “the minimum” would be that the PQ apologizes.
The formula of consortiums is a common practice around the world.
Usually, it is an alliance with a temporary limit that allows two or more companies to group their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already started and will last until 2012.
In all cases, the contract has been granted without competition; it has been a negotiation.
Furthermore, the formula of the consortiums has no longer been the exception to the standard in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the formula of consortiums in the technical advice sector is undergoing government investigation.
A quick look at Quebec’s merchant record allows you to identify more than 200 consortiums, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its leading competitors, such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, i.e., Dessau.
As regards the consortium Energie gérance, Minister Normandeau pointed out that “the territory of the James Bay responds to a dynamic of private labour and Hydro-Québec responds specifically to it since the 1970s.”
The major head of the Eastmain project, Real Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
"If you respond to a bid and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
“You have two options: you can contact the actors in the sector and tell them, we will negotiate a satisfactory deal at a good price.”
“The idea, however, is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of people,” Laporte said.
The contract granted to the Consortium Energy Management is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebequense Party.
The contracts were granted by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advice contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Genivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account his participation in Energy Management.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, it amounts to $449,783,344, including the Energie management contract of $295.131,564.
Sylvain Simard has understood that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are “good known to the Liberal Party of Quebec.”
Minister Normandeau has let the PQ fall down that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance it", before it points out that it's rather its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptic.
The consumer is hardly confident in sustainable development actors, as well as fair trade brands or ecological certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Barometer of Responsible Consumption, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages defending more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even breaks its commitment.
Even if the consumption of products called "socially responsible" has increased in 2010, Quebecs seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say that they do not rely on the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Sherbrooke University’s responsible consumption observatory.
Another conclusion: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certificates carrying products called fair, as well as the credibility of products and brands carrying labels indicating that they are “equivalent,” the Barometer notes.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecans take the politicians’ speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumption sector, currently supported by nearly one-third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, gaps and the doubtful character of information make 46% of consumers dismiss this option.
It is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
Furthermore, one-third of the Quebecans say they also distrust the alleged yields of the ecological products or services attempted to sell them.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and especially changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% have given priority to purchases in their neighborhood stores and have preferred to buy grown food products in their region, the Barometer says.
More green and responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points over a maximum of 100 this year), the Homo consumus in Quebec loves to occupy the recycling king’s position that tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of the wildlife.
However, according to the Barometer, that social consciousness seems to be of doors (of their car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecans indicated that they have used public transport or have shared car to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of participants in this broad behavioral survey, which has just completed their first edition, supports the use of bicycle and walking movements.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, whom they have asked to commit financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex after the Société Angus and the Parallel, agrees to collaborate, but only through a loan.
The Society of Development Angus and the Parallel, which expected a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to repurchase Daniel Langlois’ eXcentris film complex at the Saint-Laurent boulevard and return his true film vocation, have not obtained what they requested.
The Government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would indeed be lower than the initial expectations; it could constitute a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first action plan and a request of 12.8 million, but since then the applications have been revised down.
The chairman of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris file, submitted a proposal and a plan of action to the Minister St-Pierre.
He sent her a last report a dozen days ago.
However, SODEC received a counterproposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallele and Angus have a deadline until December 31 to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a State donation should be completely dismissed.
Let’s remember that the Association of Owners of Film Rooms and Film Complexes in Quebec opposed a direct investment from the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other Film Rooms.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector are demanding considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the film, has carried the load of the author’s cinema in its premises for ten years, after funding its own construction, which could justify a derogation by the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent movies is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to loyalize its customers.
The company Angus and the Parallele, led by Christian Yaccarini, are driving a private funding campaign, hoping to gather $700,000 to open the way to the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallel, continues to project movies at eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, projecting Xavier Beauvois's beautiful film "Des hommes et des goites".
Nevertheless, Christian Yaccarini has not again contacted Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think about the downward proposals they have received.
Canada's completed veil is lifted...
The new American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers as the Canadian complex towards Americans, but reflect at the same time the feeling of superiority towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don’t think about Canada-U.S. relationships when they are going to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit has helped the Conservative government get their budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy of Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday rather offer juicy details that really substantial content.
A cable of 22 September 2008, that is, during the full federal election campaign, reports how far the United States does not enter into the issues debated by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the U.S. Ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides some explanations on this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of inferiority practically inherent to Canadians in dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such a choice to the United States (as during the 1988 Free Trade Campaign).
Therefore, he concludes, the United States is “the proverb elephant of this choice: all-present, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it.”
The Ambassador has even more problems in understanding this "deceiving silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, he thinks, the ability of a candidate, a party, and even more, the head of a party to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor in which electors should think when voting."
This feeling of importance can also be observed the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, a business officer in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“His journey will help ensure the government’s survival during the trust vote in early February over the federal budget, by which Canada will first record deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $4 billion,” Breese writes.
Nowhere is mentioned that the government had to prolong Parliament before Christmas to prevent the coalition from replacing it or that the opposition parties conditioned its survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins warns Washington about the increasingly negative image that transmits the dramatic series broadcast in the U.S. CBC.
The ambassador concerns the issue of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle references are made to Maher Arar, the No-Fly-List, or even the abductions for the CIA to perform energetic interrogatory.
Another cable states that, during her first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner whether Europe would be willing to welcome some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied that yes, but that depended on "every case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "has delivered a document to the Secretary of State relating to Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian Muslim."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the moods in relation to WikiLeaks website have been warmed.
Tom Flanagan, a former counselor very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC’s radio that the responsible for this massive escape should be “murdered”.
In the United States they echo Mike Huckabee.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the UN has proposed in Cancun a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in a hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GEIs) in an amount that almost corresponds to one-third of the additional decrease to be carried out to stabilize the planet’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is framed in the set of large specific projects that the UN expects to be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent light bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, are replaced by fluocompact light bulbs or, even better, by electroluminescent diode light bulbs (DEL or "LED"), much of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of humans emit on the planet.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is equivalent to 70% of emissions from the planetary car park.
Last year in Copenhagen, large emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans to decrease global GGE emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, even 5 Gt of such amount should be decreased to stabilize, before 2020, the increase in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from discontrol.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, that is, 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bulbs, energy spending is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is still reduced twice.
Fluocompact light bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those launched by manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a light bulb, allowing us to make an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would apply in a hundred countries.
These new light bulbs can also work with rheostates and emit very little heat.
Above it contains no mercury.
Several specialists have expressed their reserves for fluocompact light bulbs, as they contain mercury and should be eliminated as dangerous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers put instructions.
However, the report indicates, the main source of emission of mercury on the planet are not fluocompact light bulbs, but coal thermal plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce the electricity that is collapsed with incandescent light bulbs.
Only in the United States, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury a year.
The report details the advantages of this international programme to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save a billion dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, i.e. the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast awaits anxiously the announcement of electoral results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Ivory Coast, given that the set deadlines have expired.
“The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral committee to complete its work and announce provisional results immediately,” said a spokesman for the UN head.
"Ask all Ivory Coast parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and to abstain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral committee has allowed it to pass the deadline on Wednesday to midnight without publishing the results, three days since Sunday’s scrutiny.
About forty minutes prior to the completion of the deadline, the CEI president had commented to television that the commission "kept working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday the world has multiplied the requests that the IEC finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and its opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo side has the Constitutional Council's cancellation of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former New Forces rebellion (NF) since the failed coup of state in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of Ivory Coast President, has stated that the intimidation manoeuvres of voters carried out by the FN in the north of the country had dissuaded the outgoing president’s followers from going to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council accepts the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo’s opponents consider that the country’s highest court is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who dismissed any relationship with the former rebels, has judged "inacceptable" the delay in publishing the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to claim victory.
His allies say that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that he has filed a complaint to the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral committee from dissemination of the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidency on Sunday should have put the crane to the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivory Coast political class on Wednesday that they could be considered responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who received publicly support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% in continental territory (9.7% taking into account overseas departments), as indicated in data corrected with seasonal provisional variations published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of stops remains at 2,631,000 in continental France.
Second quarter data have been confirmed, 9.3% of the active population in continental territory and 9.7% with DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they wish to work, whether or not available in the two weeks to work and seek job or not.
The situation of young people present in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a new increase in unemployment rate to 24.2% in continental France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed in the sense of ILO.
On the other hand, a slight increase in unemployment among older people has been recorded, up to 6.4% in continental France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years of age, which amounts to 6.6% with DOMs.
Only unemployment stability has been recorded among people between 25 and 49 years of age, with 8.3% in Continental France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Since 2006, the Insee has been unpublished by the monthly unemployment rate, following a controversy about its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini investigated and detained
53-year-old Alexandre Guérini, CEO of waste treatment companies and brother of PS President of the Bouches-du-Rhône General Council, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in the prison of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the framework of an investigation on alleged fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social goods, malversation of funds and public goods, covering, active corruption, trafficking of influences and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
“Alexandre Guerini will fight and answer all the questions asked by the magistrate, not ghosts.”
"It's easy to pursue him for a multitude of reproachable acts, another thing is to demonstrate them," his attorney, Florence Rault, told the AFP before his customer's appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night, one of his nearby people, Philippe Rapezzi, began investigating and imprisoned.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing his customer has done was to take care of the landfills he should manage.
As to the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to lawyer Simon.
In the framework of this file, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of Aubagne's urban agglomeration services, is also being investigated since Wednesday for malversation of funds and complicity, but he has been left in conditional release and has been prohibited to meet with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have been reproached to him."
"The judge has taken into account the explanations and has left him free," his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux, explained.
On Tuesday to Wednesday night they interrogated four other people and left them freedom, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the Republic's deputy prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been accused of "trafficking of influences and passive corruption".
Two Aubagne agglomeration officials, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been interrogated for "submission and malversation of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and for "compliance in malversation of public funds", respectively.
Lastly, companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for "covering the abuse of social property."
Among the people who have faced Mr. Guérini figured Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
The researchers suspect their societies have served to white the capital of great banditism.
The investigation is undertaken in the framework of several judicial instructions launched against X in April 2009 after receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, particularly in the waste sector.
A source close to the research points out that research focuses especially on the conditions of assignment and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects Aubagne waste, as well as from other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: Eliseo has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the destiny of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spionage", has had a violence to the public in France, has warned diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of the relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything under the attentive look of American diplomats.
U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Eliseo has explained its strategy to Americans to give them advice to manage their own hostage crisis in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials attempted to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not occur in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detainee in France and sought by U.S. justice for material trafficking for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the crude reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris leads the title "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases."
Eliseo’s counselor for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with American diplomatic Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own forced citizens in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "continuously solve" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate liberation".
Everything to embarrass the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
“When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it even more often.”
Because, once attempts to negotiate for discrete channels are exhausted, “silence will not solve anything,” the Iranians are “experts in dilatory manoeuvres.”
Mr. Richier added that detention of foreigners is “a common Iranian tactic: the take of hostages for political chantage.”
Announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on August 16, day he will refuge at the French embassy) "will require the Iranians to pay a large amount of money" (€230,000 in reward).
In addition, it notes that Eliseo anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that “was going to increase.”
The Iranians could “in a near future stop another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss leaves prison after twelve days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is requested for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic materials to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge’s decision.
The U.S. embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, close to Iranian clandestine material acquisition networks for the nuclear program, the detention of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Free Iranian in exchange for French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier guarantees that it didn’t.
Eliseo, he says, not only “has been hugely surprised by the judge’s decision,” but has tried to oppose it.
“There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice” (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but “the French government cannot cancel the decision,” he said.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the “strength” surveillance of French information services.
Eliseo’s counselor marks a phone number, hangs, and then reports to the American diplomatic that Iranian “is currently located in Paris buildings managed by the Iranian embassy.”
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Eliseo does not scare efforts, uses communications and "flights" organized in the media to make believing that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
Americans observe this activity with some irony and verify that manipulation brings its fruits, since several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions “the media ‘blitz’ of French officials.”
To what is this "gratitude" due to Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
“Despite their statements full of praise, French officials recognize privately that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
Then the document addresses the reasons that have led Eliseo to foot this fiction.
The great communication effort "aims to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening towards Syria," he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which "in view of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, was just shot of premature and deserved."
By exaggerating the Syrian role, Paris tries to show Syria the praises it can harvest if it plays a constructive role in the region.
The goal is also to “seed the seed of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. embassy knows it from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier trusts him: “Of course, we don’t know whether the Syrians have done something or not.”
“But anyway, we’ve thanked you.”
“At least, this should cause confusion among the Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at Eliseo.
In a statement, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for playing an "active role in favor of the release of our compatriots."
Starting at midnight, young Koreans can't play online
The South Korean Government will adopt a law called "Centurion" that will prevent teenagers from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to request online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight for young people under the age of 16, representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family have noted.
“Many children play all night and then they’re hard to study at school and live a normal life throughout the day.”
“We think that this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to dream,” said Jo Rin, ministerial officer of the bill.
Online games will be available again at six o'clock in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the enforcement of the law, precisely.
The government is also planning to ask companies to limit the daily access time to these games when young people’s parents so request, the responsible added.
Furthermore, it will make available to those requesting free computer programs that allow you to limit the Internet connection time.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts linked to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the unquestionable champion of the world’s online gambling competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where he faced 58 other countries.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints organizing countries
In the midst of the storm caused by corruption suspects, the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday appoints the organizing countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying can reach primary over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, a traditional bastion of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, since the International Federation expects to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a 2010 African continent premiere, or continue with its deployment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Qatar emir, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies the economic and political interests that are at stake in a World.
Transactions between frames, therefore, may last until the last minute.
It is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the Executive Committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the opportunities of his country, a football baby, which only hosted the World Cup once in 1966.
The BBC added wood to the fire on Monday by released a documentary that has evidenced three influential CE members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Sufficient to disgust FIFA and embarrass the English officials, who have launched an intense lobbying with David Cameron in the last few weeks.
Head of Government expects to re-edit the successful coup by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had accomplished the JJ.OO. 2012 organization in 2005 for London.
Will this intense activity be enough to recover England’s brightness before the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal duo also has numerous strengths thanks to its stadiums, already smart, its experience (Mundial of the 82 in Spain, JJ.OOO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the dark economic and financial prospects of both countries could drop down their ambitions.
The possible retaliations against the English people and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal the only thing they achieve is to give points to Russia, converted into a weighty outsider despite the gaps in their candidature (stadiums, hotels, transportation).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced a "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in a direct allegation to the accusations of the English press against the EC members.
"They're looking out their dirty traps, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the 1994 experience, seems to be the most logical favorites.
First world economic power and headquarters of FIFA’s leading sponsors, the country seems to bring advantage to Japan and South Korea, who have separately developed an excellent project.
However, these new applications appear to be premature for two countries that have organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the award of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, would cause Asia to remain unchanged by 2022.
Along with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stages, and Australia, FIFA would continue with its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries pose more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be harmed by the weakness of paid TV rights (based on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second mandate: the test
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had made it doubt.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy less.
One mandate at Eliseo leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will again be a candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not combine well with the mystery that is often associated with the presidential role.
Therefore, you must always seem to be doubted.
Towards one side and towards the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed he did not dismiss a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "at some point in the fall of 2011."
Therefore, the fact that it deals with UMP members, on Tuesday night at Eliseo, the possibility of “two mandates” has caused some revolt.
Is it the official announcement of your application?
Not much less.
The President only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform was limited to two of the five-year terms.
It just broadcast the facts, not an ad.
It’s not the first time he talks about the presidential, with a jokeful tone, in such meetings.
"In the worst, or better, of the cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me," he said in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not going to ask what's going to come after."
His assertions of yesterday do not closer to the candidate, nor less.
They submit comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidate at the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has gone up to the speech which leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
Rather on the contrary; the fact that their application in 2012 is obvious is what leads many PS people to claim the battle to be organized earlier than expected.
On the other hand, the bad surveys.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon’s candidate than Nicolas Sarkozy’s (46% compared to 44%), according to BVA-L’Express.
“We have a candidate and there is no discussion on the issue at the UMP,” the Prime Minister’s environment has reacted immediately and prudently.
"If he thinks he can lose, he will not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin said.
"He will always think he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned before the evidence.
Euro: ECB is Obliged to Maintain Acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should allow to clarify the modality of exit from the crisis or, at least, announce the interruption of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations that should end by the end of the year.
Due to the crisis of the European sovereign debt, the Frankfurt emission institute will certainly not be able to be so perennial if it does not want to risk aggravating a situation more than complicated today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be equally high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, supported the active role played by the ECB in the resolution of the debt crisis of European States.
He didn’t mean if he considered the central bank should do more, for example increasing its state bond purchase program.
"I reserve my opinion for my European colleagues."
Evening in Brussels, during his hearing before the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet was not more eloquent about his intentions, indicating only that the State Letters purchase program in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decided" during the Thursday meeting.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will maintain its main invariable type at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of Treasury obligations by the ECB has doubled last week to reach nearly €1.350 billion.
In addition, according to the indiscrete market operators, Irish and Portuguese securities would have bought again yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the eurosystem have acquired securities for EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, you do not doubt the least that purchases will follow (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant changes in the direction.
Although loan operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited allocations of liquidity at beneficial conditions and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months today.
"I don't think you're going to modify your program considerably."
"If not, it would be at risk of causing new short-term tensions," said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that a progressive departure announced during the first quarter of 2011 will take place," said Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In relation to interventions in the public debt market, “the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of such obligations for the market to remain stable,” Norbert Bräms adds.
Taking into account the importance of European bank exposures to the sovereign debt markets in the eurozone, the emission institute has no choice than maintaining its presence in the market.
“It must at any price compensate for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way that it prevents a marked increase in returns paid by the most fragile states,” a major bond manager said yesterday.
Because, if interest rates are placed by clouds, states will have even more trouble reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the Government of Berlusconi captures the temporary
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation slightly improved yesterday with the reflux of the types of obligations to 10 years.
A recovery of precarious calm.
At the exit of a meeting with the Minister of Economics, the regional presidents said they listened to Giulio Tremonti to qualify the situation as “uncifrable” and that an “unpredictable” weekend was expected, later denied statements by the person concerned.
In any case, on Tuesday, the difference with the long-term German rates had reached the record of 210 basic points and the price of bankruptcy risk coverage contracts (CRQ) had risen to 263 points, causing a certain uprising in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that in Spain, the difference with German types was more than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, expressed himself "deeply concerned" about "turbulence in the markets" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and stagnation of income associated with it, causing the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its funding needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts have set up a jar of cold water for the government.
Italian growth is estimated to reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being reviewed in the Senate is based on 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will account for 4.3% of GDP next year (from 3.9% expected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Therefore, the rumor that new budget provisions can be applied after the parties, for a amount of €7 billion.
"Where necessary, further austerity measures must be taken," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
“The foundations of their economy are in order and their accounts in good condition, as we have said for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the Italian International Monetary Fund responsible for the IMF.
“There is no immediate problem, neither short nor long-term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are lower than those required from other countries,” says OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan.
The problem of political instability is left.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a censorship motion in the House of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated by the end of March.
In such a case, a period little favorable to decision-making would be opened in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the strengthening of crisis fighting mechanisms
Christine Lagarde has repeated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: “I think we have already shown Sunday night and day that Europeans are clearly solidarity, determined, committed to the defense of their currency and monetary zone.”
Although it was relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday in the types of obligations of European States has driven governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet talk about a principle of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most common white today of speculation.
“Like in May, political clarity and transparency really lack, which weighs significantly on banking systems,” said Exane BNP Paribas economists.
Especially because “the political pace is much slower than the pace of markets.”
Conscious of this hiatus and the dangers it hides, European countries intensify debates to strengthen existing mechanisms to leave the crisis.
The informal consultations between the Ministers of Finance that are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts go on a good way.
And this also taking into account the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings earlier next week.
The ECB meets today.
In the agenda, the type of unconventional measures to support the euro area countries in the market colimer (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, launched a tour across Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform Far East investors about the newness of the crisis in Europe.
Although the goal of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first EFSA securities emissions are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative has entrusted the Reuters agency that the United States would support a potential increase in mobilized funds through additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for countries in the first line, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in connection with the organization of the labour market.
These reforms are added to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move forward a different path than Greece and Ireland followed.
Both want to avoid at all costs requesting international assistance prior to implementing their own budgetary corrections and to decide the structural reforms they consider essential to enhance confidence in a lasting manner.
The capitalist partners of European funds, finally, are raising the options available to accelerate the standardization process of public bond markets.
On 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that if the €75 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to remove the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading actor in the European public debt market, believe that an additional amount of around 100,000 billion euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilization mechanism, currently endowed with €60 billion.
A counsel that would certainly be able to examine the European capitals in detail.
Especially if market conditions are worse.
Snow and Ice: 24 departments in orange alert
Snowfalls continue to cause circulation difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and can affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are in orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments already in orange alert, eighteen since Wednesday to midday and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Weather France, strong snowfalls affect north of Gironde and Charentes, although also snow slightly in Isla de France.
Layers of snow are expected between 2 and 5 cm, timely between 7 and 10 cm, in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The departments affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Baja Normandy, Isle of France and Lemosín.
Snowfalls are strong enough to cause circulation difficulties and affect some economic activities, Weather France alert.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tonnes, including Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac, has been banned from several departmental roads.
According to the gendarms, the circulation in the Bretagne secondary network is complicated, so they recommend not to drive except in case of need and the circulation of certain TER vehicles during the day has been prohibited.
On Thursday, school transportation in Picardia has been banned.
No specific measures were expected on Wednesday night to limit the circulation of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all drivers to drive with the highest caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation."
The Civil Aviation General Directorate (DGAC) called on airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at the Paris airport of Roissy on Thursday and 10% in Orly because of the planned snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: First Financial Drawings
Since the debate on modernization of transport on the island of France has reached its higher point, it rains billions.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we talk about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro that must build the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the state has announced a allocation of €4 billion.
On the theoretical level, this sum will be that which will subsequently allow the SGP to obtain loans in the markets to finance a portion of its double loop.
Today, we finally have the first accounts.
The 2010 Corrective Finance Act, examined in the National Assembly Finance Committee this morning, contains the planned devices to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increased tax on offices in the island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is "in the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set in numbers: "The product of this tax is €117 million a year."
The second is a modification of an office tax that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and target that increase to the Société du Grand Paris."
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
There are no figures in the text.
But it's away from 4 billion.
“The tax resources are required to be added to the €4 billion of the allocation of funds that the state will mobilize and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project advances,” we can read in the exhibition of reasons.
The SGP does not surprise this system.
"From the time income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the four billion later, as we explain."
"It will be registered in the budget and will be used based on the needs."
The SGP estimates it will start receiving the 4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the 4 billion promised are not listed in the credit, can lead to a slightly enlightened parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on 7 December.
Avenger Hackers and Diligent Spies
The WikiLeaks matter has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandal to the hypocrisy that governs relationships between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound international changes and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) is formed exclusively by press cuts.
The “extraordinary” U.S. revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual customs reflect only what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi’s sinisterly ridiculous profile has long been giving ideas to cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule according to which secret files should only be formed by public knowledge news is essential for the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (about the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to seek news about the inexistent), but because those who devote occultism not only trust what they already know, which reaffirms what they had already learned.
This is Dan Brown’s success mechanism.
The same applies to secret files.
The reporter is lazy, just as he is lazy (or has little desire) the head of secret services (if he could not be, I know what, editor of the Liberation), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sent the U.S. embassy from Rome to the State Department was the same as published the Newsweek last week.
So why have the revelations of these files caused such revolt?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, i.e., that embassies, at least since World War II and since the heads of states can call themselves by phone or take the plane to meet at dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for some limited exercises of representation, have turned into spionage centers.
Any viewer who watches research movies knows it perfectly, only we seem that we don’t know it for hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secrets of the world’s most powerful country significantly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the “verdugos”.
But let’s enter the true nature of what has happened.
Formerly, at the time of Orwell, he could be conceived to all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy has come true since, able to control each movement thanks to the phone, each transaction carried out, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as it is now, that even the cryptographs of the secrets of power cannot escape control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the venger of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can you endure a power that can no longer and cannot keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is a empty secret (and a empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge of Berlusconi’s character or Merkel is actually a empty, unsecret secret, since it comes from the public area; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has made, that Hillary Clinton’s secrets were empty secrets.
WikiLeaks has not hurt Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is obvious that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any reserved information on the network, as it would be like publishing it on a street poster.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, it cannot be expected to keep confidential conversations by phone.
Nothing is easier than discovering whether and when a Head of State has moved by plane and contacted one of the counterparts.
How can they maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly that for the moment, my forecast is a science fiction thing and therefore a novel, but I imagine government agents who distract discreetly in diligence with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, like a lot, hiding some data written in their shoes.
That information is then retained, in a single copy, in closed drawers with keys: in the end, the Watergate’s attempt to spy was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology currently advances as a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a wireless (telephone) telegraph.
The video tapes (analogical) had allowed cinema researchers to study a movie step by step, moving forward and backward, discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now CDs (digitals) only allow forward or backward from chapter to chapter, i.e., to huge proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the displacements it takes, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of normal that policy and communication techniques take us back to horse cars.
A last comment.
Olderly, the press tried to understand what was secretly worked in embassies.
Today, embassies are asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: France's promises of financing
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the rapidly unlocked financing promises (called fast start or early) made by developed countries have been met.
And the French hooks have been revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $3 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged to contribute €7.2 billion in three years and France €1.260 billion (i.e. €420 billion a year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has put its best letters on the table to convince its partners that its commitment to fast-start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a great complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation was appreciable and appreciated for what is really worth: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of accuracy.
The EU announces it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, which places it on the right path towards meeting its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made without harming official development aid.
Unfortunately, you have not reached an agreement on what it means “new and additional”.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, each one chooses the most appropriate reference.
For example, the European Commission has taken reference to 2009: international funding is maintained and 150 million in three years are added as a fast-start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references for the year or level of official development aid.
On the contrary, France considers that the funding of “all new projects” of 2010 is “new and additional.”
In other words, it does not refer to the expenditures of previous years or the total level of official development aid.
In particular, France's total amount of aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), while it aims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element is the distribution of donations and loans.
Once again, there is no norm and each chooses the calculation method.
Some, like France, believe that each borrowed euro is equivalent to a donated euro.
Of course, such a thing is difficult to justify: effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain cost-effective investments (often, projects related to emission reduction based on more effective technologies), it is fake to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a donated euro... As much as, only the cost of the loan to the country that grants the loan should be computed for its commitments (ities equivalent).
But France does not find such a reasoning useful: "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); see the EU document to see for its own eyes.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it in 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments to 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union brings a euro to fulfill its commitment, France only brings ten cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast-start financing, France makes a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions in time and, on the other, in relation to true financial effort.
Spending only 36.1 million euros, he manages to give the impression that he spends 420 million "new and additional", as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has been busy with arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why the other Member States were going to continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in negotiations, since developing countries are not stupid...
The early funding chapter is a short-term detail in relation to the entire climate negotiations.
But it might be a more sand grain in the vast machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it's not like that.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of complying with its commitments and the same way as the rest of the European Union.
But, especially, France could make the debates on gambling bets advance in terms of long-term financing (another essential chapter currently discussed): we will not get rid of the issue of the "additional trace" or the method of computing loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive in relation to this matter as it is with others.
Therefore, we have left the hope of the new Minister of Environment, Mrs. Kosciusko-Morizet, to arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on France’s fast start and its vision of the “additional trace” and the use of loans would contribute to improving the level of international confidence necessary to advance the negotiations.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child consumes 81 different chemicals on a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the Generations Futures Association (the old movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results “do not have a significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated,” acquired in Oise and Paris supermarkets between July and September the foods that usually consume a child of about ten years in four meals and a trip a day.
These meals taken as a model, which respect the official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily dai
The dish balance is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 classified as possible or likely cancer agents and five substances classified as safe cancer agents, as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies from various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
“Although almost all cases do not exceed the legal limits for each of the chemicals individually, our study clearly shows that consumers’ exposure to potentially cancerous and/or PE contaminants is concerning,” the association said.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible cancer residues and three considered as safe cancer residues, as well as about a twenty residues that can harm the hormone system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, foreseen as a tentampié for the school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to Kenya’s green grass, including in food, where the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide prohibited in the EU.
Furthermore, Russian filet, can tuna and even the bread bar or chicle were attached to pesticides and other chemicals.
In the claw water, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon rod was the most "nutritive" with 34 chemical waste detected and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk generated by these “pollutant cocktails” for the consumer “probably underestimates itself,” the study says.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed "faced to the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EASA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetable consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
